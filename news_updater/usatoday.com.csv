A solar eclipse Tuesday caused an Alaska Airlines flight to redirect briefly so passengers could enjoy the view at about 35,000 feet in the air.

The change of plans was established a year ago, when passenger Joseph Rao, associate astronomer at the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium, realized that the eclipse's path would intersect with his flight path  almost half an hour before his flight arrived, according to Alaska Airlines blog.

Rao called the airline, and officials decided to adjust the flight so passengers could experience the eclipse from the air.

The University of Arizonas Steward Observatory's Glenn Schneider organized the new plan for the flight and Rao presented them to airline officials, who moved the departure time to 25 minutes later.

The flight from Anchorage to Honolulu held about a dozen astronomers and ""eclipse chasers,"" along with about 150 other passengers.

Some of the astronomers and ""eclipse chasers"" on the flight travel the world to see eclipses, according to the blog. This one was visible over Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

As if we needed another reason to think ISIL is the worst

An Islamic State operative captured in Iraq told U.S. military personnel that the terrorist group had plans to use mustard gas against American allies fighting them, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. Whoa. The weapons were going to be used against Kurdish forces and other U.S. allies, the official said; the timing of any such attack wasn't clear. The captive was a top chemical weapons official under Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was ousted during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and later executed, a second official told USA TODAY.

Erin Andrews, our hearts go out to you. The wrenching experience of secretly being filmed nude by a stalker and having those videos plastered all over the Internet, with wounds made fresh by an emotional civil trial ... just awful. It was no cakewalk for the jurors, either, we're learning. Debate in the deliberation room was intense, heated and, at times, everything but physical, reports The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK. The argument that her sports broadcasting career was helped by the peephole vids? Jurors didn't buy it. ""I think she persevered despite the video,"" said juror Terry Applegate . ""Because of her strength of character she was really able to succeed in her career."" Read the full accounting here.

The world has lost the 'fifth Beatle' (not the 'GoT' author  c'mon, people!)

The legendary Sir George Martin, who produced much of the Beatles music  including Abbey Road, has died at the age of 90. Martin signed the Fab Four to their first record contract in 1962 and is known for defining and shaping the Beatles' sound. The remaining Beatles, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, took to Twitter to share their memories. ""If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George,"" McCartney wrote on his website. Note: Some fans have mistaken Sir George Martin for Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, who is very much still alive.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks at a campaign rally in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., Tuesday, March 8, 2016. (Photo: AP Photo, Gary McCullough)

WASHINGTON  Marco Rubios bad week got worse Wednesday with two new polls showing the Florida senator trailing Donald Trump by double digits in his home state ahead of next week's crucial GOP presidential primary.

Rubio also under-performed in four primaries held Tuesday, and CNN reported that some of his advisers have urged him to quit the race. But there's no indication Rubio plans to abandon his bid before home-state voters render their verdict next week.

You believed in me once,"" he told a rally near Jacksonville, Fla., Tuesday night, referring to his Senate win in 2010. I am asking you to believe again. We can win this election and we will.

The new polls cast Rubio as a decided underdog in Florida ahead of next Tuesday's primary.

A Quinnipiac University survey of 657 likely Republican primary voters shows Trump leading Rubio 45%-22%. And a CNN/ORC International poll of 1,014 adult Floridians shows Trump with a 40%-24% advantage. Both are well outside the margin of error.

The effort within the Republican Party to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidential nomination appears unlikely to stop him from taking Florida's delegate-rich winner-take-all primary, said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.

Anti-Trump super PACs are blanketing the Sunshine State airwaves with ads aimed at taking down the front-runner.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush reportedly plans to meet this week with Rubio and the other two Republican presidential candidates competing with Trump  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. All three are are in town for Thursday nights GOP presidential debate in Miami.

Bush, still revered in parts of Florida, dropped out of the race last month after incessant attacks from Trump contributed to a poor showing on the campaign trail.

His meetings with the remaining candidates suggests he may be ready to endorse one of Trumps rivals in an effort to prevent the brash billionaire from capturing Florida and its coveted 99 delegates.

Tuesday proved an abysmal night for Rubio, who failed to squeeze a single delegate out of nomination contests in Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi.

So far, Trump leads the delegate chase with 458, followed by Cruz with 359, Rubio with 151 and Kasich with 54. It takes 1,237 delegates to win the nomination.

Analysts generally agree that winning the Florida and Ohio primaries on Tuesday would give Trump an almost insurmountable path to the nomination.

If I win those two, I think its over, Trump told CNN Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Cruz repeated his calls for Rubio and Kasich to get out of the race so the anybody-but-Trump factions can coalesce behind him.

If you want to stop Donald Trump, the answer is ... to unify behind our campaign, he told reporters in Miami. If youre a Jeb supporter. If youre a Marco supporter. If youre a Kasich supporter, we welcome you to our team.

Some of the most fun areas to hang out around town remain so during SXSW. Rainey Street and South Congress (SoCo) are both very walkable streets with plenty of restaurants, bars and food trailers to choose from.

Q: Are stocks really best for the long run?

A: Given the lousy start to the year and poor performance lately, it's easy to get frustrated with stocks. Some investors might think only traders and speculators make money in the market. But, the opposite is often the case.

Stock prices are unpredictable in the short term. Traders armed with computers and lots of cash to slosh around can swing stocks around. Arcane developments in the market that have little to do with companies' profit or growth can create knee-jerk moves in stocks. For instance, some stocks can be swept up in short-term movements when investors betting a stock would fall realize they are wrong and must buy the stock to close their position.

But investors have learned, academic research has proved and index funds are testament to the idea wealth for most investors is built over years, not seconds or even months. Even with the lousy start to the year, the Standard & Poor's 500 is up more than 11% a year on average over the past five years, says IFA.com. The S&P 500 has gained a more modest average 6% a year over the past 10 years, but that's still 60% better than five-year global bonds during that period. Return on cash has been even lower.

Success in the markets requires diversification but also patience. Don't let a recently bad market sour you on the entire reason to be invested.

usatoday.com,2012-09-04 00:00:00,What I wish someone had told me about freshman year,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'As A Freshman It May Seem Like Everyone Has College Life Figured Out Except You But You Re Not Alone', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Lauren Ingeno', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","As a freshman, it may seem like everyone has college life figured out  except you. But youre not alone.

Now that I have entered my final year of college, I suppose I am expected to look at the thousands of bright-eyed freshmen who have moved into their dorm rooms for the first time with a certain degree of nostalgia and envy.

Im supposed to tell them, This will be the best year of your life and You have nothing to worry about and You are so lucky. I wish I could go back.

The August before I moved away to college, which seems both like yesterday and eons ago, those were the things everyone told me.

No one ever said my first year would be difficult to adjust to, or that sometimes I would feel lost or anxious or lonely or homesick.

So, when I did inevitably feel all of those emotions, I kept them locked up inside of me like deep, dark secrets I was terrified of letting out. I felt guilty and defected.

I watched the sea of other freshmen students scream in Beaver Stadium with all the happiness in the world. I scrolled through the Facebook profiles of my friends from home, who suddenly had hundreds of pictures with their new college friends and statuses like, Loving College!! I walked through the Welcome Week fair where hundreds of smiling students stood behind booths for every club imaginable.

So, I too, plastered on a smile during that first month of college. When friends or family from home would ask how I was doing, Id tell them, I love it! I went out to parties and laughed and pretended I was having the time of my life.

In reality, I felt like everyone around me somehow knew each other, and I would never find a close group of friends. I achingly missed my boyfriend who was three hours away. I was unsure about my major, and it caused a great amount of anxiety. And the feelings only intensified because I felt like I was walking around acting like a false, giddy version of myself. I didnt know who I was anymore, and I wouldnt let anyone else find out either.

But I didnt dare let anyone see me that way, because I was sure that no one else felt like me.

Then one morning after returning back to school from a weekend at home, I finally told one of my roommates, Im really unhappy here. I felt like a giant weight had been lifted from my chest.

She lay in bed while everyone else was asleep. Me too, she whispered.

And just like that, I suddenly wasnt alone.

Over the next few weeks we had long talks about how we had been feeling. She felt lonely and lost too in our big university. Later, I found myself in my dorm hallway while another friend cried in front of me about how homesick she was. Little by little I realized it was egotistical of me to think that my feelings were entirely my own. A lot of people felt a little bit like I was feeling.

Even the people I knew who seemed so well adjusted had days when they missed the comfort of old familiarities.

I finally stopped worrying that my peers would look at me strangely if I was having a bad day. I didnt mope around in bed, but I also was honest with the people around me and was able to make stronger, more genuine friendships.

Looking back now, I can sigh with relief that things did get better. I hardly recognize the scared, anxious girl who sat in her first college class three years ago. But I also didnt suddenly get happy overnight. It was a slow process of learning to be who I was when I was away from everything I knew, and learning to make choices and be content with them.

Freshmen, Im not trying to scare you. For many, if not most of you, this will indeed be a great, worry-free year. But if you are like me and you hit some hurdles along the way, please know: You are not alone. Dont expect everything to be shiny and picture perfect the second you walk on to campus. It takes time. And if you end up feeling sad, dont feel guilty.

Things are going to go wrong. Youre going to run out of money. Youre going to break up with your significant other. Youre going to fail a test. Youre going to reassess your major and your goals. Youre going to miss your safety net from home. Youre not going to be able to juggle 20 activities at once. Youre going to make bad decisions. Everyone will. And no one is watching you with a judgmental eye.

Thats what I wish I could have told my 18-year-old self. And finally, everything, eventually, will be OK.",[]

Volkswagen says the head of its U.S. operation, Michel Horn, who had been at the center of its diesel emission controversy, is leaving ""by mutual consent.""

VW says Horn will be ""leaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately"" and will be replaced on an interim basis by Hinrich Woebcken, the recently announced as the new head of the North American Region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America.

He will assume Horn's position as president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America.

Horn, 54, took over as president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America in January, 2014, after 25 years at the company, mostly in various sales and marketing roles. But the job took a tumultuous turn late last year when Volkswagen admitted that it has inserted software in 482,000 cars in the U.S. to allow them to beat U.S. emissions tests.

Suddenly, he became the most visible Volkswagen executive in the U.S., where the deception was uncovered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board. He opened apologized repeatedly on behalf of the company. He also was charged with trying to keep dealers happy -- not an easy task since all of their diesel models, which accounted for about 20% of sales volume, were put off sale because they don't meet emissions standards.

He testified before a congressional subcommittee in October, only weeks after the scandal broke. He said VW accepts ""full responsibility"" and that acknowledged that it was ""hard to believe"" that top VW officials didn't know about the deception.

Volkswagen is still yet to disclose how it plans to fix the cars.

Its 2012; They land Peyton Manning and then draft Brock Osweiler. Peyton was going to deliver one more Super Bowl, and Osweiler was going to lead them into the future.

The chips were falling into place beautifully, too. Just as Mannings powers were waning Osweiler was starting to ascend. Manning wins his Super Bowl, retires, and all thats left is to re-sign Osweiler. Oh how wonderful it is when things like this fall into place.

And then Osweiler signed for the Houston Texans. Early reports peg the contract at four years and $72 million.

Suddenly, the defending Super Bowl champs are left in the uneviable position of looking for a good quarterback in a market saturated with resoundingly mediocre options. I mean, come on: Brock Osweiler and Sam Bradford are decent, but to command that kind of money? Give me a break.

So what are their options?

Coaxing Peyton out of retirement is juicy idea until you remember that hes simply not an NFL-caliber quarterback anymore, and so we move to the free market.

Johnny Manziel is a non-starter for obvious reasons. Case Keenum is a pretty underwhelming option, as is the idea of trading for Nick Foles. Robert Griffin III could have a huge upside but its a gamble that, quite frankly, seems a little unbecoming for the reigning Super Bowl champs. And besides, he seems destined to end up in Los Angeles at this point. How about Ryan Fitzpatrick? Hes probably the best of all these options, but hes still a pretty feverish wild card that looks ready to self combust at any moment.

And then theres Colin Kaepernick, who seems to make all the sense in the world for the Broncos at this point.

Yes, hes had a shaky last couple of seasons, but hes the only one of these players that has proved he can play among the very best in the right system. He wants out of San Francisco, too, so a fresh start might provide just the jolt he needs.

The thing is with the Broncos is that the framework is still there. They didnt win the Super Bowl because of its quarterback, they won it in spite of him. Anything better than that and they could have a serious shot again next year. Kaepernick is the only quarterback who can fulfill that requirement, and with options quickly vanishing from the table, the sooner they make a move, the better.",[]

NEW YORK  Starbucks breakfast sandwiches were recalled in 250 stores last week due to fears that they may have been contaminated with Listeria, a bacteria that can be fatal to children and the elderly.

Food manufacturer Progressive Gourmet of Wilmington, Mass., which makes the sandwiches for Starbucks, said it recalled the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches from 250 stores in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. The recall focused on sandwiches labeled ""Best Before: 07-AUG-2016.""

The recall was made ""out of the abundance of caution"" after the Listeria monocytogenes species of bacteria was discovered on a surface at its production facility during routing testing, Progressive Gourmet told the Food and Drug Administration.

""As soon as Starbucks was informed of the potential issue, the impacted product was removed from the 250 stores that potentially received it,"" the food manufacturer said.

Progressive Gourmet said it is working closely with FDA and the Massachusetts Department of Health to investigate the source of the problem. It also urged consumers who have purchased 6-ounce packages of the sandwich to return them for a full refund.

""We have not received any reports of illnesses to date,"" said Starbucks spokeswoman Sanja Gould. She also noted that the ""product itself has not tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes,"" and that no other products were affected by the potential threat.

Progressive Gourmet did not return a request for comment.

SAN FRANCISCO  The first album I can remember changing the way I thought about popular music was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

In this revelatory moment, I no doubt join innumerable Beatles fans around the globe. But the brilliant songcraft of John, Paul, George and Ringo aside, what Sgt. Pepper's did for me was for the first time spotlight the critical role of The Producer.

How else to explain the way in which that seminal album's cheering crowds, barking dogs and merry-go-round trills seamlessly meshed with the Fab Four's melodic brilliance? Surely, with an unsteady hand at the control room fader board, Sgt. Pepper's could have plummeted from groundbreaking concept album to muddled mess.

All this is prelude to explaining the almost childlike nerves I felt some years ago as I walked through the narrow halls of London's AIR Studios on a hunt for a small office occupied by a tall man named George Martin, the glue behind that fabulous Beatles collage. Or as Paul McCartney has put it, the ""fifth Beatle.""

Martin, who died Tuesday at age 90, was still a lithe septuagenarian on that September day in 1997. He was putting together a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in a few days time called Music for Montserrat. The goal was to raise money for the inhabitants of that Caribbean island  where Martin vacationed often and had a recording studio  which had felt the brunt of Mother Nature in the form of a devastating volcanic eruption that spring.

We began our conversation by focusing on the names Martin had managed to recruit for the concert, from McCartney to Mark Knopfler, Elton John to Eric Clapton. I noticed that I was often asked to repeat my question, even though I hadn't been whispering. Suddenly, the tremendous irony dawned. The man with those golden Beatle ears now had great difficulty hearing. Many decades in the studio had afflicted him with tinnitus, or ringing in the ears.

Not that Martin exuded any self-pity. Rather, our talk was filled with softly-spoken and elegantly-worded praise for the musicians who were lending a hand on both the concert as well as an album he was working on, In My Life, which featured Beatles songs rendered by an eclectic group of celebrities and musicians ranging from Jim Carrey to Celine Dion.

More than anything, Martin's utter graciousness and his understated British manner ruled the brief encounter. Eventually, I would have two more Beatle-esque moments during my years in London: bumping into Ringo Starr on the street, who just smiled at my blurted ""Hey, Ringo!"" and visiting Abbey Road Studios. I was there for a Sheryl Crow acoustic set but all I could hear in my head were Lennon/McCartney songs. But it would be the memories of my moments with Martin that endured.

Asked why he was planning to retire from producing after this effort, I recall Martin's casual shrug and broad smile. ""I've made lots of hit records, had my fair share of earnings, I'm 71 and getting older and deafer. So I just want to quit while I'm on top,"" he explained.

Prodded to dive back to 1967 and discuss Sgt. Pepper's, he would only say, with classic understatement, that the project was ""a tremendous challenge and a highly rewarding experience.""

What Martin wanted to talk about most was not how he discovered, nurtured and guided one of the most influential musical ensembles of the modern era, but rather how he and his group of friends might be able to help less fortunate people on another, much smaller, island far away.

""I told the (British) government, this (concert) does not let you off the hook,"" Martin said. ""I just want to get help to those who need it immediately. Montserrat was a God-fearing nation with no crime. Now, with no fields to play in, with nothing to do, children are open to drugs, sex, violence and stealing.""

Martin first arrived in Montserrat in 1977 and immediately decided to make it his second home. He promptly built a recording studio on giant rollers  hence AIR Studios, later used by the likes of the Rolling Stones and Jimmy Buffett  to accommodate the island's frequent tremors.

""I fell in love right away with the place,"" he said. ""In retrospect, to build there was madness. But in my life, I like climbing mountains, doing things people say can't be done.""

As music producers go, Martin sits atop Everest. Long may he enjoy the view.

Considered by many ride fiends (myself included) to be the country's best steel coaster, the over-200-foot, 77 m.p.h. screamer pays homage to the Man of Steel with its color scheme, logos, and other cursory references. The superhero theme will take a quantum leap this year, however, when passengers strap on VR headgear and embark on a hyper-realistic journey in the city of Metropolis.

""This will be the first opportunity that people will have to virtually fly with Superman,"" says Sam Rhodes, corporate director of design for Six Flags. And by fly, we're not talking about the comparatively tame rendition of flight that motion simulator rides such as Star Tours at the Disney parks and the Harry Potter rides at the Universal parks deliver. We're talking about flying alongside Supes while experiencing an actual, stomach-churning 221-foot drop, maneuvering through tight turns loaded with bone-crushing G-forces, and floating heavenward from multiple bouts of zero-G airtime.

The Superman VR experience, which will recruit passengers to help battle baldie baddie Lex Luthor, will also be offered on Superman coasters at Six Flags America in Maryland and Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio. It will be one of two VR storylines the park chain will be introducing this season.

The other will be a futuristic fighter plane experience called New Revolution. The plot, which sounds suspiciously familiar to Independence Day, will feature a humongous mothership filled with aliens who are up to no good. Instead of Will Smith, coaster riders will get to be the heroes who save the planet from annihilation.

The New Revolution name fits the story, but it also corresponds to the name of a coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California. The park had already announced that the classic Revolution coaster, which dates back to 1976, would be getting a major update this season with new trains and other modifications that are designed to deliver a smoother ride. With the addition of the VR overlay, perhaps it should be called The Really New Revolution. The park will debut the ride on March 26.

Dare Devil Dive at Six Flags Over Georgia near Atlanta and Shockwave at Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas will include the sci-fi VR experience starting March 12. Later in the spring, Ninja at Six Flags St. Louis in Missouri, Goliath at La Ronde in Montreal, Canada, and Steamin' Demon at The Great Escape in New York will incorporate The New Revolution. All riders on all trains will be offered the VR opportunity (although those who would prefer to forego it can make that choice), and there will be no additional charge.

It would be hard for passengers to be heroic without any weaponry. Six Flags will have you covered. The VR headgear will include controllers that riders will be able to use, video game-style, to fire virtual guns. The shooting will only be enabled while the trains ascend the lift hills. Traditional coasters typically spend about 40% of each ride slowly click-clacking up a lift hill. While it helps build anticipation, it's generally the least engaging part of a ride. By incorporating VR, the lift hill will become an essential part of the coaster experience.

The VR will actually begin before the trains leave the station. Once passengers get into their seats and don the headsets, they will have a fully realized, 360-degree, 3D view of the alternate reality. It won't be a fixed video. It will be a virtual landscape that will be linked to the trains' motion and will respond to the passengers' head movements. According to the team working on the rides, the headgear will not include audio, but there will likely be external sound effects blasted from speakers set up around the coasters.

Six Flags has been exploring VR for years, but only recently began to pursue it in earnest. The German-based company, VR Coaster, presented an on-ride demo of its technology in November 2015. ""We're seasoned veterans, but we got off and said, 'Wow, this is amazing,' "" Petit notes. ""We have to fast-track this now.""

The Six Flags VP says the folks at VR Coasters cracked the code to make the concept viable and compelling. The system uses the latest Samsung Galaxy smartphone clamped into a Samsung Gear VR headset. The goggles were designed in conjunction with VR innovator, Oculus. They will include modified head straps and chinstraps to help secure the equipment during the wild and crazy coaster rides.

The mobile phones will be loaded with a proprietary VR Coasters app that will run autonomously in the headsets. To keep the virtual experience tethered to the real coaster experience, the phones will be wirelessly connected via Bluetooth to a ""black box"" mounted on the train.

The ability to precisely track the motion of the train is critical. ""It's the magic of a VR coaster,"" explains Six Flags' Rhodes. With their vision impaired by the goggles, passengers would have no way of knowing what's about to happen on the ride. They wouldn't be able to adjust their body in anticipation of a hard bank, for instance. If every curve and other element hit them without warning, they wouldn't feel great.

The VR visuals, however, will match the coaster layout. If the coaster train is about to bank left, the perspective from the virtual fighter plane that passengers will see in their headsets will also bank left. ""Everything is more intense and more heightened than reality,"" says Thomas Wagner, the CEO of VR Coasters. ""But we've designed the experience in a way that riders always know what is coming.""

Matching the virtual to the reality is also key to preventing one of VR's biggest bugaboos: nausea. When there is a disconnect between what a person sees on VR goggles and what their bodies are physically experiencing, it can lead to queasiness. The Six Flags VR coasters will have ""realistic 3D movement in virtual reality combined and precisely synchronized with the real movement of the coaster,"" Wagner says. ""It will be individually choreographed to each unique coaster and synced to each rider. There is no motion sickness,"" he assures.

Speaking of sickness, what about passengers, including sweaty ones who might have to wait in line an hour or more on a sweltering summer day, sharing headsets and the, er, cooties factor? Petit says that the modified headgear will include anti-microbial leather on all surfaces that will come in contact with riders. Six Flags crewmembers will wipe and sanitize the gear between each use. There will be about five headsets for every seat on a coaster to allow for a steady supply of cleaned and charged units.

Other parks are developing their own VR coasters. The first one debuted in 2015 at Europa Park in Germany. Alton Towers in England will transform one of its coasters into the space flight-themed Galactica this season. Canada's Wonderland near Toronto ran a limited test with park guests on one of its coasters last fall and will continue to make the VR experience available for the 2016 season. Parent company Cedar Fair, which also operates parks such as Ohio's Cedar Point and Minnesota's Valleyfair, says that it plans to conduct a test at a second, as yet undisclosed location this year.

But with its bold rollout of the nascent technology, nobody is embracing VR coasters quite like Six Flags. With a huge numbers of passengers poised to give its nine thrill machines a whirl, it will provide a real-world laboratory for virtual reality rides. Will there be technical glitches? What impact will the VR equipment have on the passenger loading process and wait times for the rides? Will the VR experience live up to the hype? Until the coaster trains start rolling, it's virtually impossible to know the answers to these and other questions that the concept raises.

While I wasn't able to ride a VR coaster, I was able to get a sneak peek of a Superman scene on the equipment Six Flags will be using. It was eye popping and stunning, and that was without moving an inch. I'm looking forward to soaring at superhero speeds and being blown away.

Video by Ralph Musthaler

SALISBURY, Md.  It could be decades before there is a breakthrough, but a researcher has developed a computational statistical model of brain function in the posterior parietal cortex, the rear top part of the brain that is involved in sensory processing. His research could shed light onto various brain disorders.

That researcher is Michael Yifan Li, a 17-year-old James M. Bennett High School student. Li goes to Washington this week with research that has helped develop a better fundamental understanding of the function of neurons in the posterior parietal cortex, which could lead to the development of treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Li spent last summer at Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York with mentor, neuroscientist Dr. Memming Park, studying the functional organization of neurons in the brain.

He conducted this research as a member of the Simons Summer Research Program, and pursued his interest in computational neuroscience because, ""I was fascinated by the idea of using computer science and mathematics to understand how the brain works,"" Li says.

His findings suggest that not all neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are the same. Rather, some perform specialized tasks based on memory, while others can be utilized flexibly.

Li will present his research next weekend at the Intel Science Talent Search in Washington. The Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS) is the nations most prestigious pre-college science competition. Intel STS alumni have made extraordinary contributions to science and hold more than 100 of the worlds most coveted science and math honors, including the Nobel Prize and the National Medal of Science. Li is among 40 students in the nation selected to compete, and the first on the Eastern Shore ever selected. At stake is more than $1 million in prizes.

""Using a mathematical model, my results suggest that the PPC uses two complimentary strategies,"" Li explains. ""Some neurons in PPC are specialized to perform certain tasks, while others can be thought of as multitaskers.""

Li spends time outside his research with Peer-to-Peer, a math tutoring project he created for students, co-captain of the Academic Team, and as president of Bennett's National Honor Society. He plans to study computer science and neuroscience in college.

""Not many kids on the Eastern Shore have had the opportunities to conduct research. I encourage kids to seek out opportunities not readily available to them. Pursue your passion, your curiosity for science and don't worry about lack of knowledge or experience. Unlock the part of you that is truly unlimited,"" Li says.

The Hall of Famer and NBA/NCAA analyst was asked at Tuesdays Turner-CBS NCAA Tournament Media Day about his very public thumbs up to Republican presidential nominee John Kasich despite the fact that he always votes Democrat.

That turned into Barkley sharing his very honest thoughts on the political landscape in general. Heres a taste:

The Republicans always do a good job of dividing and conquering. They do a really good job of making black folks, poor white folks and Hispanics not like each other. Everybody wants to talk about black and white, when the situation is really about rich people against poor people. ... All they talk about is immigration, the notion that illegal immigrants are ruining our country [by] taking jobs. ... Were shipping all our jobs out of the country. Thats, to me, worse than a few Hispanics who come here to work their behinds off. If youre a poor white person and your life sucks, its easy for you to blame Hispanics cause you dont want to look in the mirror and say, Im the reason my life sucks. The Republicans do a good job exploiting that.

Thats not all of it. Barkley went on another diatribe:

All politics is rich people screwing poor people. Poor people are too stupid to know theyre just chess pieces in a game. All the poor white people, all the poor black people, all the Hispanics, theyre in the same boat. They got no economic opportunities ... they spend all their time blaming each other because rich people throw words at them like, illegal immigration, and racism and things like that. If poor people ever get smart, and realize like, We should band together, rise up, instead of fighting each other, we probably can make a difference. ... The whole thing has turned me off because its gotten to the point where I watched the last eight years of Barack [Obama]. The Republicans disagree with every single thing he says. I feel bad for the American people. ... Its is going to have zero effect on my life who the president is. Ill be rich either way.

Good for you, Ben. May all top recruits follow in your path. The arrangement between the NCAA and NBA that forces you to spend one year in college is unethical and disgraceful. You were right to make a mockery of it.

Simmons wont be up for The Wooden Award because he failed to maintain a 2.0 GPA. So, despite being eligible to continue playing NCAA basketball hes no longer up for an award given to The Player of the Year. Because the Wooden Award, named for former UCLA coach John Wooden, is more than that, you see. Head to the website and youll be greeted by one of the many sanctimonious quotes that has been used to burnish Woodens image:

What you are as a person is far more important than what you are as a basketball player.

As a person, Wooden was, in addition to being the wise mentor everyone says he was, a cheater and a liar who allowed a booster to break rules so that UCLA could recruit and keep players (something that you could say about so many top college coaches through the years). As a basketball coach, he has few peers.

Simmons is 19-years-old, stands 6-foot-10 and has shocking athleticism. He has the chance to be an All-Star in the NBA  a league in which 77 players will make at least $10 million this year  for the next decade and a half. The only thing Ben Simmons needs to care about right now is playing basketball. If he does it well hell make enough money to keep his family secure for generations.

But because the NCAA needs its revenue-driving basketball tournament to include the top young talent in the world and because NBA owners are loathe to pay out big contracts to young players who may not work out or could take years to develop, Simmons was forced onto campus for a year. Heres how he described his time to USA TODAY:

I was just trying to be a college student, but its not easy for me just because who I am, he said. So I just tried to enjoy little things. Enjoyed it really, learning new things with people. Simmons, who started with summer courses, said one of his favorites was a Communications course. I loved my Communications class, he said. The toughest one I had was Oceanography only because I didnt have too much interest in the oceans. But I love it here. I went to summer school. I definitely love walking around the campus. I love LSU.

This is perfect. This is real. Walking around campus ... pretty great. Little things ... we should all stop to appreciate them. Pretending to care about Oceanography ... waste of time. Youre right Ben. Youre so right.

I feel bad for any professors, tutors or advisors who were forced to participate in this charade. But lets be clear: this is entirely held up by the NBA. Simmons is not at fault. Hes just navigating a system, and deftly so. The Wooden Award is meaningless; an ode to a bygone era and a system built to restrict the opportunities of the top basketball players at the behest of behemoth business interests.

Simmons did the right thing  as a person  by focusing on becoming a better player and teammate. Which is probably what Wooden the coach would have wanted anyway.",[]

NEW YORK  A few years ago, Rita Wilson had a fateful meeting with singer/songwriter Kara DioGuardi. Both had played the aspirational temptress Roxie Hart in the long-running Broadway revival of Chicago, and the production's dance captain thought they'd hit it off.

""I was in awe of her talent,"" Wilson says of DioGuardi. ""I told her, 'God, I wish I could write a song.' She said, 'What makes you think you can't?' I said, 'Kara, I don't play an instrument; I wouldn't know where to begin.' She said, 'Do you have things you want to say? Do you have an idea for a song?' ""

Wilson did: ""I told her, 'It has to do with being grateful,'"" she says, chatting before a recent performance at the landmark Cafe Carlyle. What else would you expect from Tom Hanks' wife of more than 25 years?

Thus began the process that led to the actress/singer/producer's self-titled album, out Friday, featuring a track called Grateful (co-written with DioGuardi and Jason Reeves) and songs crafted with other noted country and pop tunesmiths.

Wilson's sweet, lightly smoky voice will be familiar to those who heard her 2012 debut AM/FM, a collection of favorite tunes from the '60s and '70s. But writing new songs also provided Wilson, 59, with an outlet ""for everything I was feeling and going through emotionally""  and gratitude notwithstanding, it wasn't all cheerful.

""We want to be married to each other,"" says Rita Wilson of husband Tom Hanks, pictured with her in December 2015. (Photo: Richard Shotwell, Invision via AP)

Last spring, shortly after returning to Broadway in Larry David's hit comedy A Fish In the Dark, Wilson discovered she had breast cancer. She took a leave from the play to undergo a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, resuming her role as David's character's wife after about a month.

Now cancer-free, Wilson credits Hanks with helping her through the ordeal. ""We actually managed to laugh a lot,"" she says, as they have throughout one of modern Hollywood's most famously resilient unions.

""Part of it is that Tom and I weren't babies when we met,"" Wilson says. ""And my parents infused in me a great sense of commitment, and the importance of family. Tom came from broken marriages on both sides of his family, and I think he was really seeking that. And we both want to be married; you make it work because you really want it to work.""

Wilson will set domestic comforts aside temporarily to launch her first national tour March 29. (She'll perform songs from both her albums when she appears on music series The Kate, streaming March 19 and beginning to air on public television stations.) My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, the sequel to the film smash that launched her producing career, is out March 25. ""I have a small part in it now; so does John Stamos. We had to get in as many Greeks as we could.""

Another Broadway engagement may be in the cards as well. ""I'd love to originate a role in a musical. Hopefully something like that will come about,"" she says.

There are still limits, though, to the challenges this multitasking cancer survivor and late-blooming songwriter will tackle.

""My youngest son is licensed to skydive,"" Wilson says. ""He jumps out of planes, and he wants me to go with him. I'm like, 'I don't know  maybe?' It feels like I'm taking enough of a leap right now.""

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Second Wachowski comes out as transgender woman,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Jayme Deerwester']","This 2012 photo shows Andy Wachowski, left, Lana Wachowski and Keanu Reeves at the premiere of 'Cloud Atlas.' (Photo: Todd Williamson, Invision/AP)

Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version misidentified the agency which accused The Daily Mail of character assassination in the case of British transgender teacher Lucy Meadows. It was the coroner in her case who made those remarks.

Lilly Wachowski, one half of the notoriously private, movie-making sibling team behind the Matrix movies, has come out as a transgender woman  but alleges it wasn't on her own timetable.

Lilly, formerly Andy Wachowski (who appears on the left of this 2012 photo), says she went public now to pre-empt getting outed against her will by Britain's Daily Mail newspaper in a story she imagined would bear a headline like ""Sex change shocker: Wachowski brothers now sisters!""

The 48-year-old was adamant that her story not be told by DailyMail.com, which had printed a December 2012 op-ed piece by Richard Littlejohn that questioned whether transgender people belong in elementary school classrooms. Lucy Meadows, the subject of that story, committed suicide four months later. Michael Singleton, the coroner in the Meadows case, accused the paper of ""character assassination"" and shamed reporters present at a May 2013 press conference.

""So, yeah, I'm transgender,"" Lilly wrote in an open letter posted on the website of her hometown's LBGT media outlet Windy City Times. ""And yeah, I've transitioned.""

I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly, she explained, noting that tabloids had previously threatened to run the story. You know, when youre living as an out transgender person, its kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted  needed  some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently, I dont get to decide this.

LBGT groups such as GLAAD strongly object to publicly outing someone before they are ready to tell the story themselves.

In a statement to USA TODAY, a DailyMail.com spokesman says the website ""categorically denies that it in any way tried to coerce Lilly Wachowski into revealing her gender transition. We made absolutely clear at several points in the conversation that we were only interested in reporting the story if and when she was happy for us to do so and with her cooperation."" Their statement also pointed out that the website is an independent editorial organization from the Daily Mail newspaper, which printed the op-ed about Meadows, and that she did not cite the paper or media harassment in general in her suicide note. ""We wish Lilly Wachowski well with her journey though we are surprised as to how she has reacted, given the courtesy and sensitivity with which the reporter approached her,"" it concluded.

""I'm out to my friends and family,"" she explained. ""Most people at work know too. Everyone is cool with it. Yes, thanks to my fabulous sister, they've done it before, but also because they're fantastic people. Without the love and support of my wife and friends and family, I would not be where I am today.""

Lilly has been married to Alisa Blasingame since 1991.

Lilly's older sister, 50-year-old Lana Wachowski (born Laurence) publicly acknowledged her transition in 2012. While accepting the Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award, Lana confessed that her feelings of gender confusion once had driven her to consider suicide. ""There are some things we do for ourselves,"" she said, ""but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.""

Fast-forward four years to Lilly's announcement.

Lilly Wachowski shared a self portrait with Chicago's ""Windy City Times."" (Photo: Lilly Wachowski, Windy City Times)

She says she considers herself one of the lucky ones. ""Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process. Transgender people without support, means and privilege do not have this luxury. And many do not survive.""

While acknowledging, ""we have come a long way since Silence of the Lambs,"" that didn't mean Lilly didn't harbor any fears about coming out in 2016. ""Being transgender is not easy. We live in a majority-enforced gender binary world. This means when you're transgender you have to face the hard reality of living the rest of your life in a world that is openly hostile to you.""

In Lilly's experience, the terms ""transgender"" and ""transition"" don't tell the whole story, either.

""To be transgender is something largely understood as existing within the dogmatic terminus of male or female,"" she wrote. ""And to 'transition' imparts a sense of immediacy, a before and after from one terminus to another. But the reality, my reality is that I've been transitioning and will continue to transition all of my life, through the infinite that exists between male and female as it does in the infinite between the binary of zero and one. We need to elevate the dialogue beyond the simplicity of binary.""

She echoed Lana's speech when she closed her essay with her new mission statement: ""So I will continue to be an optimist adding my shoulder to the Sisyphean struggle of progress, and, in my very being, be an example of the potentiality of another world.""

NEW YORK  Apples iPhone and Samsungs Galaxy are the Coke and Pepsi of smartphones. The ongoing debate is Whos got the fizz?

The latest to sparkle are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge devices that Ive been testing for the past week or so. The phones hit U.S. stores Friday at starting retail prices among North American carriers of around $650 and $750 for the S7 and S7 edge, respectively. Of course, various monthly installment pricing deals requiring no money down are available.

The new phones are handsome and bear a strong resemblance to last years praiseworthy S6 and S6 Edge devices. Improvements this time around center around features Samsung brought back (after removing them on the S6s), notably water resistance and expandable storage. And Samsung managed to restore the features while maintaining the thin-metal and premium-glass aesthetic of the S6s. Rival iPhones aren't water-resistant and don't have expandable memory.

*The basics: I like the way both Galaxys feel. The back is smooth, almost slippery, but comfortable to hold. The bezels are narrow. The rear camera barely sticks out.

One significant drawback, though: The rear surface is prone to smudges and reveal fingerprints.

Speaking of fingerprints, the fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone worked well. You can also use the fingerprint sensor to verify purchases through Samsung Pay.

*The displays: The 5.36-ounce S7 has a brilliant Quad HD 5.1-inch display, the same size screen as the S6. The Edge weighs a bit more and has a 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Thats the same screen size as the iPhone 6S Plus, despite the fact that Samsungs phone is considerably smaller than Apples phablet.

Edge is so named because of the customizable secondary edge screen that with a swipe of your finger cascades along the curved right side of the phone. Samsung devotes more space to the edge display on the new model, and I found it more useful for accessing frequently used apps or glancing at headlines and stock quotes.

You can also set the Edge screen to light up when you get a call or receive notifications if the phone is turned over. Once or twice, however, I inadvertently summoned the display.

Theres also an always on display feature that shows you the clock, your calendar and notifications for missed calls over a dark background. Samsung claims no discernible hit on the battery. LG promises a similar feature on its upcoming G5 phone.

*Battery life: Both Samsung phones come with 32 GB of internal storage, the only option in the U.S. But you can expand that capacity by adding an optional microSD card, which is concealed inside the device on the same tray that holds the phones SIM card.

Whats missing in the new Galaxys though  and this applies, frankly, to all the major smartphone players, not just Samsung  is any kind of giant leap in smartphone innovation.

Indeed, the feature leaps here are evolutionary not revolutionary. Here are the major ones:

*Water resistance. This means you can carry it in a torrential downpour or inadvertently drop it in a puddle or toilet, which for testing purposes I did. Fortunately the auto flush didnt gobble it up and the phone survived. Better still, there's no longer an awkward protective flap covering the USB port as was the case on the water-resistant Galaxy S5.

For the record, Samsung says the phones can withstand up to 5 feet of water for up to a half-hour. The phones are said to be resistant to dust, too.

*Camera. The S7 and S7 Edge boast first-rate camera systems that let you automatically focus on a subject really fast, certainly quicker than the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Samsung has also bolstered the ability to shoot in low light, resulting partly from a dual pixel sensor that the company says has been borrowed from DSLR cameras. A new front-flash feature in which the screen momentarily lights up when youre taking a selfie copies a similar feature on the latest iPhones.

I was generally very pleased with the quality of the pictures (and videos) that I shot in auto mode. Serious photographers can manually change the shutter speed, ISO and a number of other camera settings.

*Battery. As with the S6 and S6 Edge, the batteries inside the latest devices cannot be removed by the user, a bummer for some. But the latest phones boast a much larger battery than on earlier models, promising to last longer.

The phone charges quickly, too. In my tests, I powered up from zero to a 47% charge on the S7 in 30 minutes and reached 88% in an hour. On the S7 Edge I got to 41% in a half-hour and 77% in an hour.

Located at the corner of St. Claude and St. Roch avenues, across from the bright orange Healing Center that includes the New Orleans Food Co-Op, the St. Roch Market first opened in 1875 as one of the citys many public markets. Although it was restored in 2012 with $3.7 million in public funds, it took a while for a stalwart team of foodie entrepreneurs to navigate the red tape necessary to open for business. Will Donaldson and Barre Tanguis, founders of the Launch Pad work space, now lease the space and selected the 13 food vendors that bring the market to vibrant life. From fresh shucked oysters to craft cocktails and hearty duck gumbo, there is a flavor for every appetite.

The Market is an easy walk or bike ride from the French Quarter (1.5 miles away), and its just across the street from the Marigny, a neighborhood attracting more and more visitors. Open daily at 7 a.m. for coffee and pastries, with full-on food service starting at 9 a.m., the market stays open 'til 10 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday and 'til 11 p.m. Thursday to Saturday.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Better turnaround bet,"['Adam Levine-weinberg', 'Est March', 'The Motley Fool', 'A M']","Macy's and Nordstrom are both working hard to bounce back. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA)

Last year was a bad one for most department store chains. Macy's (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) were no exception. At Macy's, adjusted earnings per share slid 14% to $3.77 in fiscal 2015, down from $4.40 a year earlier. The decline would have been even steeper but for some real estate gains that Macy's recorded last year.

Meanwhile, Nordstrom posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.32 in fiscal 2015, down 11% from $3.72 a year earlier. Given these poor results at Macy's and Nordstrom, it's not surprising that both stocks have posted negative total returns of nearly 30% over the past year.

Macy's and Nordstrom are both working hard to bounce back from this rough performance in the next few years. Which one is more likely to pull off a successful turnaround?

Macy's slims down

Macy's is betting on slimming down to improve its financial results. In January, it announced plans to close 36 of its roughly 770 Macy's stores this spring. It is also generating incremental savings by cutting a few positions in each remaining store, closing a call center, and eliminating some management positions.

In short, Macy's is hunkering down to maximize earnings in a weak sales environment, before hopefully returning to sales growth in 2017. The company expects to post a modest margin improvement in fiscal 2016 despite its projection that comp sales will decline about 1% year over year.

Nevertheless, Macy's recognizes that it will need comp sales to start growing again to return to the historically high profit margin it achieved in fiscal 2014. To do that, it is investing in its top-performing stores, improving its mobile app, adding Bluemercury and LensCrafters boutiques to certain stores, and even putting off-price sections in some full-line stores.

Nordstrom estimates that strategic growth initiatives cost a total of $140 million last year. (Photo: Patrick T. Fallon, Bloomberg)

Nordstrom keeps betting on growth

Nordstrom is implementing some modest cost cuts of its own. However, its main focus is on investing more efficiently to drive future sales growth. A year ago, Nordstrom set a goal of reaching $20 billion in revenue by 2020, up about 50% from 2014, and it is sticking to that plan. This sales growth will allow it to leverage its past investments and rebuild its profit margin.

Nordstrom estimates that strategic growth initiatives, including its entry into Canada, the Trunk Club concierge fashion business, and its investments in building out an off-price e-commerce business cost a total of $140 million last year. That's equivalent to a roughly $0.50-per-share earnings headwind.

These young businesses should eventually mature to profitability. Nordstrom expects them to generate a combined loss of about $110 million in fiscal 2016, with most of the loss coming from Canada. Profitability improvements will probably accelerate thereafter, as Nordstrom Canada will open the last of its initial group of six full-line stores next year.

Nordstrom is also working to improve the profitability of the Nordstrom.com site. Management has tacitly acknowledged that it has been overly focused on growth rather than e-commerce profitability in recent years. Now, Nordstrom is looking to reduce its shipping costs while removing items that aren't profitable to sell online.

Some analysts have warned that Nordstrom's increased focus on e-commerce has permanently reduced its margin structure. That's probably true -- but the pendulum has swung too far. In fiscal 2010, Nordstrom's retail operating margin was 11.5%. By fiscal 2015, that was down to 6.9%, excluding impairment charges.

As Nordstrom's investments mature over the next several years, its retail operating margin should bounce back. Even if the previous peak is now out of reach, a 10% long-term operating margin seems plausible. That represents a huge profit improvement opportunity.

Nordstrom is in better shape  but there's a catch

Overall, Nordstrom seems more likely to make a full recovery than Macy's. Much of its margin decline over the past few years has resulted from a deliberate long-term investment plan.

While growth slowed somewhat in the past two quarters, there's no doubt that Nordstrom's investments are paying off -- the company's retail sales rose 7.5% year over year in 2015. Nordstrom just needs to recalibrate its investments to maximize profitability. By contrast, Macy's is facing significant sales erosion, which could be hard to reverse.

However, even if Macy's doesn't make a full recovery, its shareholders could still do well. The company is finally focused on monetizing some of its vast real estate portfolio, which could potentially free up billions of dollars of cash for dividends and share buybacks. Macy's real estate holdings thus represent a valuable parachute for investors in case the retail business struggles to return to growth.

Taylor, during jury selection in a federal court in the Brooklyn borough of New York. Pugh, a U.S. Air Force veteran and former airplane mechanic charged with trying to join the Islamic State group, was convicted by the jury Wednesday, March 9, 2016. It was the first verdict to result from more than 70 cases the government has brought against U.S. citizens accused of trying to support the militant group. (Photo: Elizabeth Williams, AP)

NEW YORK - A U.S. Air Force veteran was convicted Wednesday of terrorism charges for attempting to join the Islamic State group and die a martyr, the first verdict from more than 70 cases the government has brought against Americans accused of trying to support the militant group.

An anonymous jury began deliberations Tuesday afternoon in the case against 48-year-old Tairod Pugh. He was convicted of attempting to provide material support to terrorists and obstruction of an official proceeding.

I think hes sad, Pughs attorney, Eric Creizman, said as he left the courthouse. I feel bad for his family.

Right now its just disappointing, he said of the verdict. This was an interesting case in that there was no direct evidence  everything was circumstantial.

Prosecutors said Pugh was stopped at a Turkish airport in January 2015 carrying a laptop with information on Turkey-Syria border crossing points, 180 jihadist propaganda videos, including footage of an Islamic State prisoner beheading, and a letter declaring: I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States.

During the trial, prosecutors showed jurors materials found on Pughs computer and cited a letter Pugh wrote to his wife saying, in part: There is only two possible outcomes for me: Victory or martyr.

Prosecutors said he flew there so he could find a route into Syria and join the Islamic State group. He was forced by authorities to turn back and was arrested soon after his return on a flight to New York City. Pugh was in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990, when he was trained to install and maintain aircraft engines and navigation and weapons systems.

During closing arguments Tuesday, Creizman insisted Pugh had no ill intent when he went to Turkey a month after losing his job as an aviation mechanic and telling his supervisor to stop talking to me like Im an idiot. He said Pugh had hoped to move to the Middle East with his wife.

He said his client was feeling small and inconsequential when he started researching the rise of the Islamic State group in the summer of 2014, impressed that Muslims somewhere were trying to establish a country and wouldnt back down from anything.

This is a fantasy, Creizman told jurors of Pughs social media posts that seemed supportive of radical Islamists.

He said his client had always talked about Middle East politics and liked to research the subject online, but he noted that many of the articles he read were written by mainstream news organizations, including some critical of the militants.

Still, he acknowledged that Pugh had opinions some might find offensive and Pugh believed some of the Islamic State groups atrocities were a media creation.

Other defendants have pleaded guilty to charges of trying to support the Islamic State group, but the verdict further demonstrates our commitment to bring justice to all those who seek to provide material support to terrorists, said John Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.

For less than the change in your pocket, investors can buy a share of one of 11 stocks in the very broad Russell 3000 index that trade for less than $1 a share, including cleaning supply maker Swisher Hygiene, ethanol company Kior and wireless company NII Holdings, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. The Russell 3000 is an index designed to measure just about every stock that trades on a major exchange.

Investors often think that low-priced stocks are easy places to get giant percentage gains when the broad market goes nothing. But the truth has been everything but this year.

All but one of the stocks trading for $1 or less are down this year, even while the Russell 3000 itself is up more than 3.5%. An equal-weighted index of these $1-or-less stocks is down 46% this year, a brutal hit when the Russell 3000 index is up 3.8% in the same time period.

Longer term these low-priced stocks have even more of a disaster, which is really saying something. Shares of the 11 $1-or-less stocks are down an average of 70%, which the Russell 3000 is up more than 15%.

If youre thinking these sub-buck stocks are calling out to you as bargains, dont. Not one of these $1 stocks gets an average buy rating from Wall Street analysts and also an attractive rating from stock research firm New Constructs. New Constructs determines if stocks are attractive or dangerous by measuring the present value of expected future cash flows.

There might be some hope for a few $1 stocks, if analysts are correct. Analysts 12-month price targets on three of the stocks is more than $1, says S&P Capital IQ. Clothing maker American Apparel, retailer Wet Seal and Paramount Gold and Silver have median 12-month per-share price targets of $1.18, $1.50 and $1.95 respectively. Keep in mind, though, that most of these stocks are covered by very few analysts, so the price targets and ratings could be the opinions of a small number.

Justice Antonin Scalia in Cleveland in 2007. (Photo: Mark Duncan, AP)

The late and ever-colorful Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia raised some eyebrows when he pronounced that ""for the sake of argument,"" he might accept that ""sexual orgies eliminate social tensions and ought to be encouraged."" Fittingly, Justice Scalias passing has prompted activist groups all over the political spectrum to engage in a veritable orgy of public advocacy over President Obamas intention to nominate Scalias successor during the throes of a presidential election. This explosion of free speech also is something Justice Scalia would have encouraged, and it is precisely what he and his colleagues envisioned in the courts Citizens United decision and other First Amendment rulings.

It wasnt that long ago  2002, to be exact  when Congress and the president tried to insulate themselves by law from public pressure on these types of matters. Under the McCain-Feingold law enacted then, any entity that was incorporated  which most advocacy groups are  was prohibited from sponsoring broadcast ads in the 30 days prior to a primary election and 60 days before a general election that referred to anyone on the ballot. Similar to the debate now playing out, a pro-life group called Wisconsin Right to Life wished to sponsor television ads during the 2004 elections urging then-senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold to stop blocking Senate consideration of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees. (Feingold, who is now running to reclaim his seat, also was up for reelection then.)

A majority of the Supreme Court (including Scalia) struck down the law prohibiting Wisconsin Right to Life from urging the public to contact their senators about judicial nominations. In a concurring opinion, Scalia wrote of the importance to protect the groups right to put political pressure upon Senator Feingold to change his position on the filibuster  not only through the constituents who accepted the invitation to contact him, but also through the very existence of an ad bringing to the publics attention that he, Senator Feingold, (stood in the way) of a vote on judicial nominees. In that same opinion, Scalia suggested that the court also could eliminate restrictions on independent expenditures altogether that expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates. Three years later, Scalia and his colleagues did exactly that in the Citizens United decision.

The Citizens United and Wisconsin Right to Life rulings made it possible for advocacy groups today to put the heat of public opinion on senators and presidential candidates to confirm or block Supreme Court nominees, and to push this as a campaign issue. Ironically, many of the same groups exercising their speech rights in this manner also have urged a reversal of Citizens United, whether by constitutional amendment or Supreme Court appointments. Scalia surely would have scolded such intellectual jiggery pokery.

Even while Citizens United invalidated outright prohibitions on political speech, the debate over issues of public concern is still by no means an unregulated bacchanal. To the contrary, what in common parlance is known simply as free speech and democracy is often regulated as grassroots lobbying under state laws if the speech concerns state-level matters. Under both state and federal laws, groups speaking about issues and candidates also may still be required to file campaign finance reports. Whats more, the IRS regulates advocacy on matters like judicial nominations as both a political activity and a non-political activity, and also as lobbying that may or may not be restricted, depending on how a group is structured. Admittedly, Scalia voted to uphold some of these substantial burdens on political speech. To which a Scalian retort might be that speakers should not be forced to wade through this legalistic argle-bargle simply to engage in the public debate over the justices successor.

Parties petitioning the Supreme Court to enact national policy changes during Scalias tenure were met by his stern admonition to Persuade your fellow citizens its a good idea and pass a law. It was within that spirit that Scalia and his colleagues invalidated laws in Citizens United and Wisconsin Right to Life that prohibited citizens from banding together to persuade their fellow citizens on issues of public concern.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

We may not know for sure exactly what Scalia would have thought about the merits of the arguments now being made about who should appoint his successor. But we do know what he would have thought about the robust debate. As Justice Scalia said in several interviews of his position in Citizens United: The more speech, the better. Appropriately, this principle lives on in his death, thanks to that often misunderstood and maligned ruling.

usatoday.com,2016-02-16 00:00:00,"Photo tour: The all-inclusive, family-friendly Hyatt Ziva Cancun","['Special For Usa Today', 'Melanie Reffes']","At the tip of the Yucatan peninsula, 547-suite Hyatt Ziva Cancun is the only resort in the Mexican party town that is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea on three sides. All-inclusive and family-friendly, the newest addition to the Zona Hotelera strip is 25 minutes away from the Cancun International airport. Once a Camino Real Resort and more recently a Dreams Resort, USD$85 million bought a sweeping refurbishment that included an additional 160 rooms and resort-wide upgrades. Inviting a classy crowd, spring breakers are welcome particularly couples, families and multi-generational clans who will find a myriad of on-site activities like the Delphinus Experience, set to open this year that will be an interactive dolphin habitat where guests can swim with the friendly marine mammals.

Even the directionally-challenged find navigating the resort a breeze. Friendly folks working at the resort are eager to please as they honor the Hyatt signature 'Service from the Heart' by placing their hand on their heart as they pass every guest. The elevated lobby captures ocean views to the northeast, and in the evening the lights of Isla Mujeres; a near-deserted island 20 minutes by ferry from Cancun, is a sparkly affair. Marrying modern with Mayan, one side of the lobby is cut from coral stone while the opposite side is designed with glass cubes that are wrapped in a matrix of latticework reminiscent of windswept driftwood. The grand staircase morphs into seating for concerts and theater performances staged in the outdoor amphitheater.

The resort boasts 15 room categories in three towers, ranging from swim-up suites with infinity pools to two-story suites with plenty of room for families. The three towers cater to different guests: The Pyramid building is the shortest and looks out at the North Pool and one of two beaches; the tallest building is called the Club Tower and has 147 rooms on 18 floors; and the adults-only Premium Tower offers direct access to the Zen Spa is 160 rooms on 11 floors. For special occasions (or special people), there is a Presidential Suite that spans the entire top floor of the resort.

The suites are big on views of the Caribbean Sea, well-manicured gardens or the 40-year-old, candy-cane striped lighthouse that is still in operation. As a nod to the local community, suites are outfitted with made-in-Mexico furnishings and butterfly-colored lighting in the bathrooms. Welcome touches include gratis resort-wide Wi-Fi, room service and TVs that remember the last channel you watched. Hyatt Club Level guests enjoy perks like swift check-in and checkout, en-suite espresso makers, beach butlers and access to the Bar del Mar Lounge for a cocktail and sweet selection of petit fours.

The Kidz Club is full of fun stuff like a tree house, pool and game room. For the grown-ups, Zen Spa is a full house with 13 treatment rooms, awesome seafront hydrotherapy pools and five palapas (shaded huts) on the beach. Take your pick from an international massage menu that runs the gamut from Mexican mud wraps with Mayan plants and tequila to Caviar Facials that use the real stuff to refresh and renew. Clever extras include slices of icy cucumbers that take the sting out of pesky sunburn.

There are three lagoon-style infinity swimming pools: North Pool that fronts the beach; South Pool with two-story wooden cabanas that rent for USD$150-$240 per day; and one that is strictly adults-only, featuring swim-up bars and a big hot tub. Non-motorized water sports are gratis and include snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding, water basketball and aerobics classes in the pool. Beach time is sweet with loungers for siestas, fire pits that warm the evenings and a pier where you might spy elegant birds taking five on the beams. On dry land, there are tennis courts, bicycles, volleyball on the beach and yoga classes in the gym with its 14 treadmills and impressive, free weight zone.

Nine restaurants and six bars and lounges keep hunger and thirst at bay day and night. Taste-test French fare in Bastilles with standouts like rack of lamb or go for the antipasto bar and pizzas made to order in Lorenzos. Fans of the film Pulp Fiction will like Chevys Diner, where you can dig into a burger and a chocolate milkshake in a real 1957 blue Chevy. Those with a yen for Asian fare head to The Moongate and for the classic steakhouse experience; Tradewinds next to the South Pool is Spanish-style elegance. Barefoot on the sand is fun at Habaneros where youll wile away the afternoon munching tamales, spicy shrimp and citrusy ceviche. To wash it down, an icy cold Mojito does the trick nicely.

Casa Cafe opens at 7 a.m. for those who covet their morning cappuccino, but for anything earlier, 24 Horas is conveniently open 24 hours a day. Dips and Sips by the pool is for just that and for a nightcap, bartenders at the Sassil Bar in the lobby pour a fine glass of wine. Tequila aficionados are a happy crowd at Juana Margarita, where the selection includes a vintage five-year aged bottle. On the menu at Tres Cervezas, fiery wings with dipping sauces like mango and habanero, football on big screens and artisan beer brewed on site keep it busy. For weddings, Brew master Juan Jose Garcia creates custom brews from the bride and groom's favorite flavors.

Food carts roam the resort with fruity crepes and spicy pineapple on a skewer. For those who save room for dessert, Pasteles is part Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory and part Barbie Doll Dreamhouse with bowls of gummy bears, gooey brownies, lollipops and chocolate fountains. Pink-haired servers make cotton candy and fill cones with icy cold gelato.

And then theres the Mercado buffet, designed to look like a Mexican market. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, mornings get going at the Bloody Mary Bar where a large selection of goodies await like smoked fish, breakfast empanadas and Asian dumplings. Later in the day, chefs grill scallops, mash the best guacamole this side of Acapulco and flame-broil steaks, chicken and seafood. Check out the intriguing selection of pickled veggies in mason jars, slice a wedge from one of many homemade loaves of bread and go back to the dessert tables for sweets baked on-site by the pastry chefs.

DETROIT  The presidential polls were off. Way off.

They indicated former secretary of State Hillary Clinton would easily win the state's primary election. The polls in the last week had Clinton as the victor by anywhere from 13% to 37% over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The Detroit Free Press poll taken last week had Clinton up by 25 points.

But those polls missed the enthusiasm for Sanders on the ground, especially among young people, said Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.

""He ran a very smart, strategic campaign. His rallies were very targeted, and there were people lined up for miles trying to get into those things,"" he said. ""And he did respectably among African-American voters. She didnt get the margins she was expecting there.""

Consider the voter turnout shattered records when more than 2.5 million people cast ballots. Sanders won big just about everywhere, except in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. And while a big showing in Wayne County and its city of Detroit often spells victories for many candidates, the turnout was 25% in Detroit and 31% in Wayne County, while the statewide total was closer to 40%.

Hundreds of supporters of Sanders began meeting weekly last summer across the state, in places such as Lansing, Detroit, Traverse City, Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids, said Kelly Collison, a Sanders volunteer from Lansing. As their numbers grew, many were willing to drop everything to help out the campaign, including heading to Iowa and New Hampshire to help their candidate to victories.

""Between the rallies, which got people fired up, and the grass roots support that weve had in this state since last spring, this was truly a unique election,"" she said. ""The message that is really firing people up is that nothing can happen to change in the country unless the American people rise up.""

The trade issue was a late-breaking issue that not only affected the whole discourse of the campaign. I think it turned a lot of voters away from Hillary Clinton. Bernie Porn, president of EPIC/MRA

And while Clinton had broad institutional support from many elected officials and some unions, she didn't have the passionate following that was the hallmark of Sanders' campaign in Michigan.

While many said the race in Michigan would come down to demographics  and Clintons advantage with African-American voters  exit polling done for CNN suggested it was more about issues and widespread dissatisfaction with the federal government.

Clinton had tried to hit Sanders for what she claimed was a vote against the 2009 auto rescue, a charge he fervently denied as misrepresenting his support. But in the end, it was his claim  that Clinton had supported trade deals that hurt U.S. employment  that resonated with voters.

""The trade issue was a late-breaking issue that not only affected the whole discourse of the campaign. I think it turned a lot of voters away from Hillary Clinton,"" said Bernie Porn, president of EPIC/MRA, the Lansing-based pollster who did the poll for the Free Press and other media partners. ""Even in our poll, she was not doing as well with union members.""

Indeed, two of the most influential unions in the state  the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO  declined to endorse anyone in the race.

He also said the electorate showed some Clinton fatigue Tuesday.

""The same thing happened with Bush, and he got out of the race. Clearly, there was much more passion from the people who were attracted to Sanders,"" Porn said. ""She was perceived as too close to business, and all that Wall Street stuff may have also connected.""

New York businessman Donald Trump also did well among voters who felt economically unstable, and his victory was more in line with what the polls predicted. He won nearly 37% of the vote, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who had about 25%, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who had 24%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio finished a distant fourth, with 9% of the vote.

""He appeals to people who, whether they admit it or not, consider themselves vulnerable in this society and they think Donald Trump has their backs,"" said Farmington Hills, Mich., political consultant Paul Welday.

CNNs exit poll, which surveyed 1,601 Michigan Democratic voters as they left their precincts Tuesday, showed that 58% of them believed trade with other countries costs jobs, compared to 30% who believe they create them. And among those who believe trade costs jobs, Sanders won by a large margin, 58% to 41%.

Meanwhile, most voters in the exit poll  70%  declared themselves angry or dissatisfied with the federal government, and of those voters, 54% backed Sanders compared to 45% for Clinton.

Clinton scored well with the 27% of Democratic primary voters who believed experience was the top quality they wanted in a candidate, winning 79% to 20% among them, and with the 11% who wanted to back the more electable candidate. She took those voters 74% to 26%.

But Sanders scored better with a larger group, namely the 33% who said they wanted a candidate who cares. Among those, he beat Clinton 55% to 41%, according to CNNs exit polls. Among the 27% who said honesty was most important, he won 80% to 19%.

Clinton did far better with black voters, as expected, winning that bloc, 65%-31%, but that was a much smaller margin than in Southern states, and black voters made up less than one-quarter of those voting. And among the 68% of voters who were white, Sanders won handily, 57%-41%.

Darci McConnell, a Detroit political consultant, said Clinton took the African-American vote for granted.

""The first commercial I saw courting the black vote was from Bernie. The first mailer I got was a few weeks ago from Bernie, and the first mailer I got from Hillary last week was asking for money,"" she said. ""Dont make the mistake of assuming that folks will be there, especially when it comes to young folks.""

And while Sanders held huge rallies across the state, Clinton's events in Michigan were small and more focused on things like visiting businesses and going to Detroit churches the Sunday before polls opened.

Clinton won with the 56% of the electorate that is female, 51%-46%, but Sanders did better with men, 55%-43%. And in terms of age, Clinton, as expected, won with older voters, taking 57% of the vote from people ages 45-64 and 68% of that from those older than 65.

The first commercial I saw courting the black vote was from Bernie. The first mailer I got was a few weeks ago from Bernie, and the first mailer I got from Hillary last week was asking for money. Dont make the mistake of assuming that folks will be there, especially when it comes to young folks. Darci McConnell, a Detroit political consultant

That age group  45 and older  made up 55% of the Democratic electorate, a big number but not big enough to stop Sanders, who got a whopping 81% of the voters age 18-29, larger than many may have expected. Those voters made up 21% of the electorate. He got 55% of those age 30-44, who made up 25% of those voting.

The turnout in counties with big student populations  such as Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo and East Lansing  was way up, and Sanders won those areas with significant, double-digit margins.

Clinton led among self-described Democrats who made up 69% of those voting, with a 57%-41% edge over Sanders. But among the 28% who voted in the primary who described themselves as independents, Sanders won handily, 71%-28%.

With all the votes tallied, pollsters were left scratching their heads, crunching the numbers and trying to figure out how to do it better next time.

""The polls were more wrong than in a long time,"" Porn said.

Part of the problem for some of the polls, including the last one for the Free Press, was that the surveys were done before the Super Tuesday election results and before the debates on both the Republican and Democratic side.

""Several of the polls that were really wrong were automated calls and you couldnt call cellphones,"" Porn said. ""But our modeling looked at normal turnout in terms of participation of younger voters and that was way underestimated.""

The NHL called the sexual assault allegation against Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane unfounded and the All-Star would face no discipline, the league announced on Wednesday.

The league considers the matter closed, the NHL said in a statement.

usatoday.com,2016-01-31 00:10:31+00:00,Top 100 fantasy baseball rankings for 2016,"['Steve Gardner', 'Hours Ago', 'Herija Green', 'Usa Today Fantasy Sports', 'Cory Bonini']","UPDATE: For our Top 200 fantasy baseball rankings, please go here.

Certainly, no fantasy owner in his or her right mind would even consider drafting a team this early in the offseason. But that doesnt negate the need to start preparing for whenever that first draft might come.

What follows is a first look at the top 100 overall fantasy players for the upcoming MLB season, based on a standard 55 Roto league. To give some context to the numbers, comments are sprinkled throughout. And remember, things can change  perhaps significantly  before the regular season begins.

Rank Player Pos 1 Mike Trout OF 2 Bryce Harper OF 3 Paul Goldschmidt 1B 4 Clayton Kershaw SP 5 Anthony Rizzo 1B 6 Andrew McCutchen OF 7 Carlos Correa SS 8 Giancarlo Stanton OF 9 Josh Donaldson 3B 10 Jose Altuve 2B 11 Nolan Arenado 3B 12 A.J. Pollock OF 13 Manny Machado 3B 14 Miguel Cabrera 1B 15 Jose Abreu 1B

For a lack of a better term, here are this years first-rounders. A case can be made for any of the top three at No. 1, but Trout has the highest floor and thus gets the nod here. Hes never had any injury issues and he plays in the American League.

Goldschmidt begins a run of four first basemen in the top 15, but the more interesting trend is the trio of third basemen in the first round. Donaldson, Arenado and Machado can be almost interchangeable since they all hit for both power and average.

Kershaws track record of excellence makes him the only pitcher Id consider with my top pick.

The two wild cards whove rocketed into the first round are Correa and Pollock. The five-category upside is there  especially with Correa at a thin shortstop position  but the track record isnt there ... yet.

Rank Player Pos 16 Dee Gordon 2B 17 Kris Bryant 3B 18 Joey Votto 1B 19 Madison Bumgarner SP 20 Max Scherzer SP 21 Starling Marte OF 22 Jake Arrieta SP 23 David Price SP 24 Chris Sale SP 25 Jose Bautista OF 26 Edwin Encarnacion 1B 27 Mookie Betts OF 28 Buster Posey C/1B 29 Carlos Gomez OF 30 Zack Greinke SP

(UPDATE 1/29: Sales superior strikeout rate and Greinkes move to hitter-friendly Arizona has them switch places. Sale previously was No. 30, Greinke No. 24.)

The top tier of corner infielders seems to end here with Bryant, Votto and Encarnacion.

This is also where you begin to see the top starting pitchers. The need for a staff ace to anchor a fantasy team comes into play here so look for many owners to take the plunge in Round 2. Theres plenty of talent to go around.

Eye-opener: Betts had a phenomenal second half and is poised for a true breakout season. Perhaps hell be the 2016 version of Pollock.

And dont sleep on Gomez. He was a first-round pick last season for his power/speed combination. Hes now on a better team and should be 100% healthy. Dont let him slide too far.

Rank Player Pos 31 Chris Davis 1B/OF 32 Corey Kluber SP 33 Charlie Blackmon OF 34 Xander Bogaerts SS 35 Todd Frazier 3B 36 Justin Upton OF 37 Troy Tulowitzki SS 38 Jose Fernandez SP 39 J.D. Martinez OF 40 George Springer OF 41 Ryan Braun OF 42 Gerrit Cole SP 43 Adam Jones OF 44 Robinson Cano 2B 45 Carlos Gonzalez OF 46 Jason Heyward OF 47 Matt Harvey SP 48 Anthony Rendon 2B/3B 49 Dallas Keuchel SP 50 Nelson Cruz OF

(UPDATE 1/29: Davis and Blackmon move up in this group. Davis after re-signing with Baltimore and Blackmon after the Rockies traded Corey Dickerson to Tampa Bay. Braun drops nine spots from No. 32, mostly because the Brewers are going to be terrible.

Im warming to the possibility Springer has a big year. He moves up seven spots to No. 40. Matt Harvey takes a major jump after the official word that there will be no limitations on his innings.)

Theres a ton of power in this group  with the bat and with the arm. If you havent acquired a No. 1 starter yet, there are still some decent ones available.

Bogaerts and Tulowitzki round out the top trio of shortstops. You take your chances with anyone else at the position.

Rank Player Pos 51 Corey Seager SS 52 Eric Hosmer 1B 53 Stephen Strasburg SP 54 Miguel Sano DH 55 Lorenzo Cain OF 56 Chris Archer SP 57 Prince Fielder DH 58 Jake deGrom SP 59 Jason Kipnis 2B 60 Adrian Beltre 3B 61 Johnny Cueto SP 62 Matt Carpenter 3B 63 David Ortiz DH 64 Kyle Seager 3B 65 Felix Hernandez SP 66 Kyle Schwarber C/OF 67 Freddie Freeman 1B 68 Jon Lester SP 69 Yoenis Cespedes OF 70 Adrian Gonzalez 1B 71 Hunter Pence OF 72 Ian Kinsler 2B 73 Sonny Gray SP 74 Noah Syndergaard SP 75 Billy Hamilton OF

(UPDATE 1/29: Not many changes here, just a little shuffling in the rankings. The DH-only guys have been pushed down a little.)

By this point, you could go with steady veterans or trendy up-and-comers. What kind of a season will we see from Strasburg? Hes a huge bargain if he can stay healthy. Does Ortiz have one more big year left in him? Does Beltre?

On the other hand, Corey Seager figures to be the Dodgers everyday shortstop after his impressive (.337/.425/.561) September audition. Syndergaard and Schwarber are tantalizing sophomore talents.

Dont be afraid to reach for Sano, either. He averaged a home run every 15.5 at-bats, which ranked in the top 15 among hitters with at least 300 plate appearances. Hell find a position in the field and wont be DH-only for very long.

Rank Player Pos 76 Brian Dozier 2B 77 Wade Davis RP 78 Craig Kimbrel RP 79 Carlos Carrasco SP 80 Ian Desmond SS 81 Kole Calhoun OF 82 Albert Pujols 1B 83 Brett Gardner OF 84 Francisco Lindor SS 85 Adam Wainwright SP 86 Gregory Polanco OF 87 Kenley Jansen RP 88 Cole Hamels SP 89 Yasiel Puig OF 90 Rougned Odor 2B 91 Marcus Stroman SP 92 Maikel Franco 3B 93 Jonathan Lucroy C 94 Jacoby Ellsbury 2B 95 Danny Salazar SP 96 Salvador Perez C 97 Jose Reyes SS 98 Ben Revere OF 99 Aroldis Chapman RP 100 Matt Kemp OF

(UPDATE 1/29: Moving out of the top 100 for one reason or another are Michael Brantley, Corey Dickerson and Brandon Crawford.)

Finally we see some closers popping up. Davis or Kimbrel  flip a coin for the first one off the board. (Although ... if not for the possibility of a suspension to start the season, Chapman would be ahead of them both.)

Things start to get a little fuzzy as we get closer to 100. Reyes may be facing a suspension, too.

Among the players currently on the outside looking in: Shin-Soo Choo, Jordan Zimmermann, Michael Wacha, Mark Trumbo, Masahiro Tanaka.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 13:42:21+00:00,Everything you need to know about Maria Sharapovas failed drug test,"['Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Nate Scott', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Andrew Joseph', ""Nate Scott Is A Writer Editor At Ftw Leading The Site's Culture Coverage He Likes Writing About Soccer Basketball Music Tv The Evils Of The Ocean""]","Earlier this week Maria Sharapova held a press conference in Los Angeles and admitted that she had tested positive for meldonium, a little-known drug that became a banned substance under WADA code starting January 1. Sharapova says she didnt open an email alerting her to the change, which explains the failed test.

Lets get to your questions:

What is meldonium?

Meldonium is a drug that was first manufactured in Latvia decades ago and has never been approved by the FDA. It is used to treat ischemia, lack of blood flow to an organ. It has also been used to treat neurodegenerative disorders.

WADA banned the drug because it has shown to aid oxygen uptake and endurance.

Did she explain why she was she taking it?

Sharapova says she started taking meldonium due to several health issues I had back in 2006, including a magnesium deficiency, regular influenza, irregular heart test results and early indications of diabetes.

How long does one usually take the drug?

Latvian company Grindeks, which manufactures meldonium, told the AP that four to six weeks was a common course. Sharapova said she had been taking the drug since 2006.

Did Sharapova know the drug was going to be banned on January 1?

Thats something that will probably never be known. Sharapova says she received the email about the list of newly banned substances but didnt open it.

Heres WADA chief Dick Pound, though: Any time there is a change to the list, notice is given on September 30 prior to the change. You have October, November, December to get off what you are doing.

All the tennis players were given notification of it and she has a medical team somewhere. That is reckless beyond description.

Is Sharapova the only athlete to test positive for meldonium?

No. Five other Russian athletes tested positive for the drug across various sports, leading Russian President Vladimir Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov to issue a statement saying that the positive tests shouldnt be projected onto all of Russian sport and do not cast a shadow on Russian sport, on the amazing achievements of our athletes.

How are other players reacting?

The sports biggest star Serena Williams came out in support of Sharapova, saying she showed a lot of courage in taking responsibility for her failed drug test, and said she was glad Sharapova was very honest and upfront about it.

The same cant be said for Jennifer Capriati, who issued a scathing critique of Sharapova on her Twitter page, saying in a tweet that was later deleted: I didnt have the high priced team of [doctors] that found a way for me to cheat and get around the system and wait for science to catch up.

How long will Sharapova be suspended?

Sharapova has already forfeited at least $400,000 in Australian Open prize money, and could see a multi-year ban, though the usual punishment is a one-year ban, according to WADA. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) will decide on the suspension. The decision could cost Sharapova a trip to the Olympics this summer.",[]

The college announced Dalys decision in a news release Tuesday.

In the last two months, one member of the schools board of trustees, Andrew Bournos, stepped down amid racial controversy, and a majority of the schools faculty called for board chair Albert J. Gruner to resign. The board passed a resolution in support of Gruner on Saturday.

However, school spokesperson Matt Frey said Dalys decision is unrelated to the campus controversy. This is about (Dalys) family issues that have to be dealt with in an immediate fashion.

The college will announce Dalys replacement after an interim president is selected in the coming weeks, Frey said.

Board trustees and faculty alike lamented Dalys departure on Tuesday.

Regrettably, Mount Saint Mary College has lost a transformational leader, acclaimed scholar and administrator, Gruner said in the news release. Unfortunately, her vision for the future greatness of the Mount will not be realized under her guidance. Family issues have become an absolute priority in her life. She will be greatly missed. The Board of Trustees wishes her all success and Gods blessings as she enters a new phase of her life.

During Dalys term as president, the college added academic programs, increased enrollment, improved freshman-to-sophomore retention rates to an all-time high, increased on-campus residency to record levels, and launched a five-year strategic plan, according to the college.

I am devastated by Dr. Dalys decision to leave Mount Saint Mary College, trustee Jeanne Hosinski said. She is truly an excellent leader who had a wonderful educational vision. I doubt we will find anyone of her caliber to lead the institution.

James Phillips, an assistant professor of theater at the college, expressed hope that Dalys move could improve relations on campus.

I wish the best for Dr. Daly and her family and I will keep them in my prayers, James Phillips, an assistant professor of theater at the college, said. I hope the trustees will look to finding an interim president that can help us heal and move forward in a way that honors our founders and Dominican heritage. Now is the time for everyone connected to the college to come together to restore the qualities that our students and alumni have cherished.

Teachers and faculty have expressed concern over the current direction of the colleges culture in previous Journal reports.

The Mount community is currently in turmoil, and I pray that the faculty, students and administration can join together to move our college through this difficult time, Mike Daven, professor of mathematics, said Tuesday in an email to the Journal.

Troubles began in April when faculty and students protested a decision by the colleges board of trustees to not renew the contracts of two popular professors. The professors claimed they were wrongfully let go over disagreements with the administration over censorship on campus.

Tensions arose again in November when faculty members expressed concern about the appointment of Bournos. Bournos resigned in February amid claims that he promoted links to videos with anti-Semitic, anti-Islamic and homophobic content on two of his personal social media profiles in 2013. Bournos resignation came a day after an article was published on the Inside Higher Ed website detailing his posts. The school has said Bournos resignation was not related to the article.

Last month, faculty said Gruner is unfit to serve the remainder of his term because he disregarded the practice of shared governance at MSMC and instigated hostile confrontations, according to a resolution passed by faculty. However, on Saturday, the board of trustees unanimously passed a resolution during its quarterly board meeting in support of Gruner.

Trustees unanimously said the allegations made by faculty were false and unfounded, and expressed their support for Gruners leadership both as a trustee and as chair of the board. They said they reached their decision after careful consideration and a lengthy discussion, according to an emailed statement to the Journal.

Despite its current troubles, Tracey Niemotko, professor of Accounting and Chair of the School of Business, said the college was fortunate to have had Daly.

Her caliber as a professional educator and person is extraordinary, Niemotko said in an email. I have been impressed by her background, integrity, communication skills, generosity, kindness and devotion to the college. When she came on board, my thought was, How did we get so lucky?",[]

usatoday.com,2014-03-13 00:00:00,4 tips for non-writers on writing college admissions essays,"['Jon Fortenbury', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network', 'The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","By Jon Fortenbury, Schools.com

By Ingram Publishing Even if writing is not your strong suite, here are tips to writing a better college essay.

You can still write a great college admissions essay if youre a bad writer.

If youre less than confident about your writing abilities, your best shot at writing a great college admissions essay comes through good advice, spell check, meaningful feedback from family, friends and a tutor, and dedication. I cant help you with feedback, spell check and dedication. Thats on you. But, as a professional writer and someone who has helped people with college admissions essays, I can give you some writing advice .

Non-writers: Here are four tips on writing great college admissions essays.

1. Write in your own voice

Something Ive seen time and time again when helping people write essays is that their writing voice is nothing like their speaking voice. Of course, youll be more organized in writing and slang is to be avoided. But dont become someone else just because you think thats what the reader wants. They want to hear from you  ideally, the most clear, articulate you.

This is why its advised to not get too much help from others when writing the essay, as it could take away from your own unique voice. Hear others out, but dont let them write any of the essay for you. Writing coach David Kirby, in a Huffington Post article that combined advice from college admissions officers, wrote, This is your chance to shine: Every word must be your own...write to your ability, be yourself, and do the best you can.

Your ability. Yourself. Your best. No one else. You, the soon-to-be college freshman. Theyll see through anything or anyone else.

2. Know when to start new paragraphs

Cluttered paragraphs can lead to problems  at least in an essay like this. Follow the advice of Purdue University regarding when to start a new paragraph:

When you begin a new idea or point

To contrast information or ideas

When your readers need a pause

When you are ending your introduction or starting your conclusion

First, plan to dedicate one paragraph to each question the essay asks of you. Lets say the questions posed for the essay are, Why this college?, Why your major?, and What are your future goals?. Start with one paragraph for each one. If a paragraph seems too long, find a way to break it smoothly into two or edit it down.

And, of course, introduction and conclusion demand their own paragraphs, with the introduction stating where youre headed and your conclusion briefly summarizing the essay.

3. Do not treat this like a resume

If they can find it elsewhere in your college application, dont include it in your essay unless its vital or being elaborated on.

According to The Princeton Review, Dont just recount-reflect! Anyone can write about how they won the big game or the time they spent in Rome. When recalling these events, you need to give more than the play-by-play or itinerary. Describe what you learned from the experience and how it changed you.

Have a reason for each personality trait or accomplishment you mention in your essay. Make sure its relevant to your thesis and helps answer an essay question. Otherwise, it might as well be a resume.

4. Keep the essay concise and focused

Any good college admissions essay should be clear, concise and focused, which means no pointless rambling and no unnecessary words or sentences. Keep the writing tight, and dont replace small words with big words (using utilize instead of use for example) or small sentences with big sentences to appear flashy.

Even if the essay asks an open-ended question that has a multi-faceted answer, keep your answer brief. They dont need to know everything youve ever done and every person who has ever influenced you. According to Carleton College, Dont try to take on too much. Focus on one most influential person, one event, or one activity. Tackling too much tends to make your essay too watered down or disjointed.

Remember, the college admissions essay is your opportunity to show them your personality. Everything else is objective and set in stone. Your references can speak of your personality and elaborate on your life, but this essay is your chance for you to do that yourself.

While its generally agreed that a great college admissions essay will probably not get an otherwise inadequate student admitted into a college, it could at least tip the scales a little if youre an otherwise borderline applicant. Tip those scales toward getting admitted to college, not denied, by following this advice and letting a tutor read over your admissions essay before you submit it. Give yourself the best shot possible.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Texans follow Broncos' Super Bowl plan by grabbing Brock Osweiler,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Tom Pelissero']","Instead of being Peyton Manning's successor, Osweiler is off to Houston. USA TODAY Sports

The Houston Texans are starting to look a little like last years Denver Broncos, and not just because they stole the defending Super Bowl champions quarterback of the future Wednesday.

The additions of Brock Osweiler and running back Lamar Miller are two important steps toward building the complementary offense the Texans feel can support superstar J.J. Watt and their defense in a championship formula, not unlike how the Broncos just won a ring.

In fact, the signing of the former Miami Dolphin Miller to a four-year, $26 million deal with $14 million fully guaranteed at signing may prove just as important as Osweilers pact, which ESPN reported is worth $72 million over four years  a hefty total for a QB with seven NFL starts.

What the Texans missed as much as anything last season was a rushing attack, with Arian Foster missing all but four games because of injuries (and getting released last week). That was a hurdle weekly for a team that was just trying to get by with a mishmash of Brian Hoyer, Ryan Mallett, T.J Yates and Brandon Weeden under center.

The Texans still won the AFC South  albeit at 9-7, in a terrible division that got worse with Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Lucks health problems  on the strength of a defense led by Watt, the three-time defensive player of the year. An effective ground game wouldve helped them play even more to that strength.

Yes, the Texans are paying a premium for Osweiler, 25, whose fast start couldnt keep him in the lineup once veteran Peyton Manning was ready for the title push. Itd be foolish not to wonder why the Broncos, who know Osweiler better than anyone after four years together, werent willing to do whatever it took to keep him in Denver.

Competent QB play would be a boon to the Texans standout receiver DeAndre Hopkins. No doubt, theyre hoping the passing game is much improved.

But look to recent, defense-and-run-driven Super Bowl champions such as the Seattle Seahawks and the Broncos for how the Texans believe theyre now setting up for success, which in turn they hope can set up their new, young, highly paid quarterback for success as well.

(Photo: Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports)

Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Jarred Tinordi was suspended for 20 games for violating the NHLs performance-enhancing drug policy, the league announced on Wednesday.

Tinordi, 24, has played only 10 games this season and could be best known for being a part of the trade that put John Scotts All-Star game bid in jeopardy. Scott -- who was with the Coyotes as he led the fan vote for the exhibition -- and defenseman Victor Bartley were traded to Montreal in exchange for Tinordi.

Tinordi is the second player this year to be suspended for a violation of the drug program administered by the league and the NHL Players Association. Anaheim Ducks forward Shawn Horcoff received the same ban for a first-time offense in January.

Tinordi is the fifth NHL player overall to be suspended for the use of performance-enhancing drugs.",[]

Another glass ceiling in the cruise world shattered Wednesday as luxury line Regent Seven Seas announced its first female captain.

Serena Melani, 42, of Italy, has been appointed the new master of the 48,075-ton Seven Seas Mariner, a position that puts her in charge of 450 crew.

Melani becomes one of just a handful of women to command a major cruise vessel at any line.

""Of course, I am very proud,"" Melani told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview, noting that breaking into the still-very-male-dominated world of shipping wasn't easy.

""It was hard finding a job (on a ship) at the beginning of my career,"" she said in a phone call from Mariner, which was sailing along the coast of Brazil. ""It took me five years.""

Melani's first job at sea was with a cargo ship where she said she was the only woman on board. She also worked on oil and gas tankers for several years before moving to cruise ships. She joined Regent in 2010, quickly rising through the ranks from second officer to safety officer to staff captain.

In a statement accompanying today's announcement, Regent president and chief operating officer Jason Montague praised Melani's leadership on Regent ships and said the promotion to captain was well-earned.

""I know she will perform admirably in guiding Seven Seas Mariner as she sails from the Caribbean to Alaska, he said.

As is often the case with people who work on ships, Melani said it was a lust to see the world that first got her interested in a career at sea. She grew up in a little town along the coast of Italy, and she said she knew from an early age that she wanted to spend her life exploring.

""It is a very gypsy life; you are most of the time away from home,"" she said, noting that that's just fine with her.

Melani spends about six months a year at sea. But even in her off time, she gets antsy to hit the road, along with her husband.

""When I am 'home,' I am traveling,"" she said. ""Not by boat, because I want a change, but we like to move by motor bike or car depending on the season. I really enjoy the mountains. At least two or three times a year I go to the Italian Dolomites for hiking and climbing.""

Melani said books about travel, particularly tales of women travelers, are always by her nightstand. And she's always looking for the next adventure, which in some cases can be had just outside her floating office. Regent ships are known for globe-circling itineraries that often include stops at off-the-beaten-path locales.

""On my last trip here on the Mariner, we went down from Lisbon to South Africa, and we visited several West African ports,"" she noted. ""It was a beautiful experience.""

Melani joins a very small circle of women who have commanded a major cruise ship. Her appointment comes just eight months after Celebrity Cruises appointed its first female captain, Kate McCue -- the first American woman to command a major cruise ship. Royal Caribbean is widely credited with hiring the first female of any nationality to command a major ship, Karin Stahre-Janson of Sweden, in 2007, and the line added a second female captain from Portugal in 2008. Britain's P&O Cruises, Cunard and Silversea also have appointed female captains over the past five years.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Lawsuit challenges rule for transfers between NCAA Division I football schools,"['Est March', 'Steve Berkowitz', 'A M']","Northern Illinois Huskies players walk onto the field prior to a game against Central Michigan Chippewas at Huskie Stadium. (Photo: Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports)

The Seattle-based law firm leading a variety of class-action lawsuits against the NCAA on Tuesday opened another front against the association, this time challenging the associations rules that prevent some Division I football players from transferring to other schools without losing a season of athletics eligibility.

The new complaint was filed in federal court in Indianapolis, where the NCAA is headquartered. It is being pursued primarily by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP on behalf of Peter Deppe, a punter who had planned to transfer from Northern Illinois to Iowa.

The suit alleges that Iowa accepted Deppe academically, but that Iowas athletics department declined to pursue a waiver that would have allowed Deppe to become eligible immediately and the NCAA would not consider a waiver request from Deppe. The suit alleges that Iowa then turned its attention toward another punter who would be eligible immediately without a waiver.

Deppes case is similar to another suit related to the NCAAs transfer rules that the Hagens Berman firm is pursuing. But Deppe has remaining eligibility, and he was trying to transfer from one Football Bowl Subdivision school to another FBS school. In the other case about the transfer rules, the named plaintiff  Devin Pugh -- was attempting to transfer from a Football Championship Subdivision school to an FBS school, and that plaintiffs eligibility has expired. (Football players can transfer from an FBS school to an FCS school without having to sit out a year or lose a season of eligibility.)

As with yet another suit the Hagens Berman firm is pursuing against the NCAA, the Deppe case also seeks to overturn the associations rules capping the number of football scholarships a Division I football team may award.

But the primary issue relates to the transfer rules.

The NCAAs limitation on the mobility of college athletes is patently unlawful, the suit claims. For a striking contrast, one can simply examine the unfettered mobility of the players coaches. Football coaches, including assistant coaches, are free to leave a school at any time they choose to take another job in the college or professional football ranks. This ability to better their own situation has allowed coaches to reap enormous financial benefits. ...

Players, however, suffer a severe penalty for transferring  the loss of a year of athletics eligibility. This can make them a very unattractive option for coaches who are under constant win now pressure. The NCAAs transfer rules restrain players ability to make the best choices for themselves, including ones based on financial considerations, academic considerations, athletics considerations, and personal circumstances.

In a statement early Wednesday morning, the NCAA's chief legal officer Donald Remy said: ""The Deppe complaint repeats many of the same arguments made by the same law firm in other cases against the NCAA. Repeating allegations and legal theories does not make them true. As a result, the lawsuit should be dismissed.""

The Hagens Berman firm is overseeing the settlement of lawsuits against the NCAA, video game manufacturer EA Sports and the Collegiate Licensing Co., relating to the use of college athletes names and likenesses in video games. It is trying to gain a judges approval of a settlement with the NCAA in a case relating to concussions.

It also is involved with two cases challenging the NCAAs limits on what athletes can receive while playing college sports  cases that have been granted class-action status for its pursuit of an injunction against the NCAA and major conferences. The firm is seeking class-action status in one of those two cases for a group of athletes it claims are entitled to damages based on the difference in value between a traditional scholarship covering tuition, fees, room, board and books and a newly allowed scholarship that covers the full cost of attending college.

In addition, the firm is pursuing a case that primarily targets the NCAAs scholarship limits.",[]

When youre traveling for business, picking, packing and toting your clothes may at times feel like a second job. But a host of apps are trying to make life on the road a bit easier.

From online valets to services that essentially offer laundry to-go, corporate trekkers can digitally outsource much of the drudgery around their work attire.

Its about the ability to go on a trip ... and not worry about anything other than your business, says Bill Rinehart, CEO and founder of DUFL, a virtual valet that will sort, clean and ship your wardrobe to and from wherever youre traveling for work.

Customers download the DUFL app, then fill a bag the company sends to their home or office with their various business outfits. DUFL will clean, inventory and photograph all the items. Then, from that day forward, your closet is the app on your phone, Rinehart says. Customers input their business destination, the hotel where theyre staying and the dates, and the suitcase arrives the same day they do.

At the end of your stay, you can drop your bag off at the front desk, where FedEx will pick it up and ship it back to the DUFL warehouse where the clothing is cleaned and readied for your next trip.

The cost is $9.95 per month plus a $99 fee per trip, which covers shipping and cleaning. Since launching in May 2015, Rinehart says, thousands of customers have registered for the service, with the typical male client storing 50 items in his closet, and the typical woman having 150.

When you think about someone spending the vast majority of time on the road, its incredibly time-consuming and stressful,'' he says, adding that customers will sometimes order items from Amazon or a department store and have the items shipped right to DUFL.

Washio, which started in March 2013, has customers who use its services while traveling for work, as well as when they return home. .

With operations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Chicago, Boston and Oakland, business travelers can request a laundry pickup on Washios website or mobile app. The clothes are then cleaned and returned to your doorstep.

While traveling for business, most hotel dry-cleaning services are very expensive, says Washio CEO and founder Jordan Metzner in explaining the appeal of his service to business travelers.

Meanwhile, those heading out on a corporate trip can get their shirts boxed, for easy packing. And when faced with a suitcase full of dirty clothes upon their return, they can simply send the items off with Washio and they have clean clothes to take on their next trip, Metzner says.

Ben Gillenwater, CEO of his own software company, initially built his PackPoint app for himself.

Ive been a business traveler for about eight years, says Gillenwater, who is CEO of his own software company. I was always forgetting something ... like my passport, or my toiletries or even my dress shoes for work.

Now PackPoint practically does the packing for him. The app tells users what they need to take depending on their destination and planned activities, right down to reminding them to take an umbrella because it's likely to rain. And as you pack, you can check off each item within the app.

You can tell it if you will have access to laundry and if you want to repeat basics, like wear a shirt more than once, he says. A paid version of the app, which costs $2.99, can be customized  you can tell it, for instance, to never remind you to pack contact lenses since you dont wear them. And if you have a TripIt account where you assemble all your travel arrangements, PackPoint will sync with it and automatically create packing lists based on your itineraries.

Stylebook, an app launched in October 2009, isnt just for those honing their inner fashionista. The app, which has a one-time cost of $3.99, is perfect for business travelers, says co-founder Jess Atkins, because they can plan what to pack whenever they have a free moment.

Users input pictures of their clothes and can utilize the apps calendar to plan their outfits. The app also allows them to create a packing list and even post notes to remind themselves where they wore various ensembles.

With airline baggage fees at an all-time high, suitcase space is precious, and Stylebook can help you bring only items that you need, says Atkins.

Apps like these can be real time savers, some users say.

Debbe McCall, a business owner and patient advocate and researcher, uses DUFL one to four times a month.

I save hours not packing, not schlepping, not looking for overhead space, not wishing I had brought an extra outfit or pair of shoes, McCall, who lives in Temecula Valley, Calif., said in an email. And (when) I get home, I am really home, not almost home or home after I unpack, do laundry or run to the dry cleaners.

Imagine walking through security and onto a plane with only a handbag, iPad, phone and meds, she adds. Traveling is fun again.

usatoday.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,27 giant profitable companies paid no taxes,"['Est March', 'Matt Krantz', 'P M']","In this Sept. 13, 2011, file photo, United Continental Airlines jets sit on the tarmac at Cleveland Hopkins Airport in Cleveland. (Photo: Amy Sancetta, AP)

Death and taxes are supposed to be two certainties of life. But a few companies have at least escaped the taxes part.

There are 27 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, including telecom firm Level 3 Communications (LVLT), airline United Continental (UAL) and automaker General Motors (GM), that reported paying no income tax expense in 2015 despite reporting pre-tax profits, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Only profitable firms were included in the analysis since firms that lost money - like many energy companies - wouldn't be expected to pay taxes.

Escaping the taxman, so far, hasn't been an advantage at least in the eyes of investors. Shares of the companies that paid no taxes are down 11% on average over the past 12 months, which is more than twice the 4.8% decline by the S&P 500 during the same period.

The underperformance might come as a bit of a surprise given how much time and effort some companies have put into lowering their tax bills.

""Income tax issues, while important, are not as important as how well as company is doing or how well an industry is performing,"" says Bill Selesky, investment analyst at Argus Research. ""It gets to be an issue that I would put at the bottom of the list.""

Yet, investors have paid closer attention to the tax rates companies pay as profit growth continues to stall along with revenue growth.

Companies must find any way possible to boost their bottom line, which for some involves looking for ways to reduce their tax liabilities.

Some have taken advantage of lower overseas tax rates, a practice that has drawn criticism. Drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) last year, for instance, drew fire last year for a plan to merge with rival Allergan (AGN) and move its headquarters to Ireland.

And on Sunday night, Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim Johnson Controls (JCI), which is planning to merge with Tyco (TYC) and move its headquarters to Ireland.

""I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin,"" Clinton said. ""They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier. Now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.""

Three of the 27 companies that paid no income tax in 2015 are based outside the U.S. including healthcare firm Mallinckrodt (MNK), financial firm Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) and insurer XL Group (XL). Several are real-estate investment trusts (REITs). Their unique pass-through accounting, which shifts the tax burden to shareholders rather than the company itself, has become a more popular structure as companies look to convert to REITs.

There are a number of reasons why a profitable company may not pay taxes. For instance, years of deep losses can affect a tax bill.

Take United Continental, which reported a $3.2 billion income tax credit in 2015 despite reporting earnings before taxes of $4.2 billion. Accounting rules allow the airline to offset taxes due with valuation allowances resulting from losses in past years. During 2015, these allowances amounted to $4.7 billion which erased the company's $1.5 billion tax bill based on its normal corporate tax rate.

It was a similar situation at Level 3. The company booked a tax credit of $3.2 billion in 2015 despite recording a pre-tax profit of $283 million in the same year. The tax gain was the result of credits associated with losses in previous years in addition to losses at Colorado-based TW Telecom, which Level 3 bought in 2014.

Not all companies breakdown in detail where they paid taxes, be it in the U.S. or elsewhere. But the location can be important to the overall taxes companies pay.

In 2015, General Motors saw a tax credit of of $1.9 billion, even though its earnings before taxes hit $7.7 billion. Uncle Sam got his due, as the company reported a U.S. federal income tax expense of more than $1 billion. Yet the company's global tax bill was a credit thanks mostly to a tax break connected with General Motors Europe.

Investors, though, should know many of these tax breaks and credits will likely eventually run out. United's 2015 annual regulatory filing warns investors as much: ""The Company anticipates its effective tax rate will be approximately 37%, which reflects a more normalized rate after the release of the tax valuation allowance in 2015 and is based on the Companys relative mix of domestic, foreign and state income tax expense.""

And at GM, ""this benefit will slowly dissipate over the 2016 and 2017 time frame,"" says Argus' Selesky says. He doesn't think it will be a problem, though.

""Assuming a decent global economy and a good mix of international revenue versus domestic U.S. revenue, GM should not have a problem counteracting that tax credit with better sales performance in some other part of the world,"" he says.

But when these companies' credits run out - the taxman will be waiting for his due.

But heres our best guess at how each American League Central team will line up from 1 to 9:

Chicago White Sox

RF Adam Eaton

2B Brett Lawrie

1B Jose Abreu

3B Todd Frazier

LF Melky Cabrera

DH Adam LaRoche

CF Austin Jackson

C Dioner Navarro

SS Jimmy Rollins

After finishing last in scoring and slugging percentage, the Sox added pop in the offseason with Lawrie and All-Star Home Run Derby champion Frazier. Dont be too concerned about Fraziers poor second half in 2015; he has a solid track record, and a more talented supporting cast should keep him from trying to do too much.

The surprise signing of Jackson relegates Avisail Garcia to a part-time role  or a full-time role in the minors.

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Eaton finished in the ALs top 10 in runs scored. Rollins, 37, was signed to a minor league deal but should be able to hold off Tyler Saladino for the majority of playing time. Both are keeping the spot warm until top prospect Tim Anderson is ready.

The White Sox revamped their catching duo this offseason. While Alex Avila might see more playing time, Navarro should give fantasy owners more bang for their buck.

Cleveland Indians

SS Francisco Lindor

DH Carlos Santana

2B Jason Kipnis

1B Mike Napoli

RF Lonnie Chisenhall

C Yan Gomes

LF Will Venable

3B Juan Uribe

CF Rajai Davis

The Indians will start the season at considerably less than full strength on offense. Left fielder Michael Brantley, a complete hitter, is recovering from shoulder surgery. He hopes to be ready by mid-April. Abraham Almonte, the projected starter in center, must serve an 80-game suspension.

Manager Terry Francona has mentioned Santana possibly leading off, but as the teams top home run hitter last season with 19, its more likely hell end up in the middle of the lineup when Brantley returns.

A lot seems to be riding on a bounce-back season from Napoli, 34, whos coming off career lows in batting average (.224) and slugging percentage (.410).

Detroit Tigers

2B Ian Kinsler

LF Justin Upton

1B Miguel Cabrera

DH Victor Martinez

RF J.D. Martinez

3B Nick Castellanos

C James McCann

SS Jose Iglesias

CF Anthony Gose

An excellent contact hitter, Kinsler continues to thrive in the leadoff spot, even at 33. Hell score plenty of runs atop this potent lineup. Upton lands in an almost perfect spot, hitting in front of Cabrera and the Martinezes. This could finally be the season he surpasses the high expectations fantasy owners have for him.

AL East | Central | West

Coming off an injury-plagued 2015, Victor Martinez had a hot start this spring with home runs in each of his first two games. It looks like his knee is much healthier.

On the down side, starting center fielder Cameron Maybin will miss at least a month with a small fracture in his wrist. Gose is a decent speed source but doesnt contribute much else on offense. John Mayberry and Tyler Collins are possibilities.

Kansas City Royals

SS Alcides Escobar

3B Mike Moustakas

CF Lorenzo Cain

1B Eric Hosmer

DH Kendrys Morales

LF Alex Gordon

C Salvador Perez

RF Paulo Orlando

2B Omar Infante

A contact-heavy lineup continues to defy advanced metrics, with Escobars sub-.300 on-base percentage at the top. The Royals were 14th in the league in home runs a year ago but sixth in runs scored.

Breakout seasons for Moustakas and Cain, plus a stunning rebound from Morales, were the keys to success. Fantasy owners would be thrilled if they could repeat their 2015 numbers.

Gordon returns after tepidly testing free agency. Despite missing more than 50 games with a groin injury, he posted a career-high .377 OBP. What if manager Ned Yost hit him leadoff?

Projected starter Jarrod Dyson will miss six weeks with a strained abdominal muscle. Orlando and possibly non-roster invitee Travis Snider will fill the void in right.

Minnesota Twins

2B Brian Dozier

LF Eddie Rosario

1B Joe Mauer

RF Miguel Sano

3B Trevor Plouffe

DH Byung Ho Park

SS Eduardo Escobar

C Kurt Suzuki

CF Byron Buxton

Just who is Brian Dozier? He had 19 home runs and 50 RBI by the All-Star break but hit .210 with nine homers and 27 RBI in the second half. Even worse, he had only three stolen bases after the break. Yet he managed to score more than 100 runs for the second consecutive season.

NL East | Central | West

Sano looked like a future home run champ, hitting 18 in 80 games. His average of one homer every 15.5 at-bats would have ranked him in the top 15 if he had enough plate appearances to qualify. However, theres no way he can duplicate his .401 average on balls in play. Speaking of power bats, Park topped 50 homers in each of the last two seasons in Korea.

The Twins would love to see rookie of the year candidate Buxton blossom to be their leadoff hitter for the next decade, but after he hit .209 in 129 at-bats last season, he still has to prove he belongs in the majors.",[]

Acting on the information, USADA, the organization that brought down Lance Armstrong, added a talk about meldonium to the agenda of its 2014 annual symposium in Phoenix.

Next came the testing of stored urine samples in late 2014, funded by the Partnership for Clean Competition. An analysis of 8,300 random urine samples revealed that 182 (2.2%) contained meldonium, according to a study in late January 2015. All of those were Eastern European athletes.

The eye-opening results of the study were published online in April 2015, and were the basis for WADA adding meldonium to its list of banned substances in October 2015, to go into effect January 1, 2016.

Almost exactly two years after USADA first heard about the drug, Sharapova was announcing in a Los Angeles hotel that she had tested positive for it.",[]

(NEWSER)  Researchers just announced the discovery of radio signals from beyond our galaxy that are behaving in strange ways. Fast radio burstsor FRBsare very rare, very quick blasts of radio waves originating billions of light years away, Popular Science explains. It's unclear where exactly in the universe they're coming from and what's causing them. Since the first one was discovered in 2007, scientists have found only 17 total, and none of them ever repeat, the Verge reports. At least that's what everyone thought. According to a paper published this week in Nature, researchers at Cornell University have found evidence of FRBs that do just that.

Scientists used to think FRBs were caused by ""cataclysmic events,"" such as neutron stars colliding with each other and exploding. Repeating FRBs means that can't be the case. ""This research shows for the first time that there can be multiple FRBs from the same place in the sky,"" researcher Shami Chatterjee says in a press release. ""Whatever produces the FRB can't be destroyed by the burst, because otherwise, what would produce the next pulse?"" And the mystery deepens: ""We're showing that whatever battery drives FRBs, it can recharge in minutes,"" astronomy professor James Cordes says. ""The energy of the event becomes very problematic."" Researchers hope to next pinpoint where the FRBs are coming from in order to figure out what they're coming from, and they'll be helped by three massive radio telescopes that start operating next year. (Speaking of space mysteries: ""Alien megastructures"" have scientists baffled.)

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,7-year bull makes investors $16T richer,"['Est March', 'Matt Krantz', 'P M']","The bull market born in the late stages of The Great Recession turns 7 today. No bull lives forever, but thats not to say the bull cant make new highs and climb further in the Wall Street record books. Adam Shell for USA TODAY

The bull market celebrates its seventh birthday today. Here's the real accomplishment, though: putting $16 trillion into the pockets of investors.

Investors with the guts to ride this bull market since it first emerged on March 9, 2009 have seen the value of stocks rise $16 trillion, according to market research firm Wilshire Associates. Just to put that into perspective, that's nearly equal to the U.S. gross domestic product of $17 trillion.

Much of those huge market gains were generated by a few runaway stars. Just seven mega-winners in the bull, digital gadget maker Apple (AAPL), online advertising company Alphabet (GOOGL) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT), together generated $2 trillion of the bull market's run, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

""Looking at the performance of individual stocks since (March 9, 2009), there have been some monster gains,"" according to a report to clients by Bespoke Investment Group.

Part of these stocks' success is due to their massive size when the bull market started. ""There is one constant: these nine companies were all large to mega-cap companies on March 9, 2009,"" says Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust. ""So, the biggest gainers by market cap were large to begin with."" Some of these big winners were also the result of valuations getting beaten down, leaving plenty of potential upside for the brave investors who stepped up.

Some of the bull market money minted by individual stocks is downright impressive. Apple holds the top spot having added $487 billion to investor wealth since the bull started seven years ago, or 4% of the roughly $11.3 trillion in wealth created by companies in the Standard & Poor's 500. Shares of Apple jumped 751% during the period to $101.12, which is remarkable given that the company was already valued at $74 billion back in March 2009. The runaway popularity of Apple's smartphone turned it into an constant winner during the bull. The company's revenue has jumped 448% from 2009 to end 2015 at $235 billion.

Stocks that got hammered during the financial crisis were also set up to profit handsomely for investors. Banks Wells Fargo (WFC) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM), but also General Electric (GE) which was heavily dependent on its financial unit in 2009, were hit hard during the financial crisis. That means they were primed to perform and generate lots of wealth for investors once the crisis eased, Smith says. These stocks ""were overly beaten up by the end of the bear market and experienced big bounces to more normalized levels,"" Smith says. General Electric's stock had dropped to $7.41 in March 2009, but has soared 306% since to $30.05.

Blistering growth in the business doesn't hurt either. Alphabet and online retailer Amazon (AMZN) have seen their revenue soar 217% and 337%, respectively, between 2009 and 2015. That massive upswing wasn't missed by investors. Alphabet has generated $408 billion since the market bull started thanks to a nearly 400% jump in its stock to $705.24. Amazon created $237 billion in market value thanks to a whopping 825% gain in the stock to $559.47.

These huge gains are a reminder to investors of why investing in stocks over the long term is still well worth the volatility and occasional distress it might cause. Some investors might wonder if the bull market is about to fade out, given some of these huge gains and how old it is. Amazon, for instance, is one of the most pricey stocks you can buy with a price-to-earnings ratio on past earnings of 444. But that's the exception, not the rule, Smith says.

""The good news here is that despite the massive gain in market-cap there is not an over-valuation problem,"" Smith says. ""That was clearly not the case with the largest companies at the end of the 1990s.""

The name of the company is Blue Origin. WAYNE T. PRICE/FLORIDA TODAY

KENT, Wash.  You could drive right past the building, surrounded by a green chain-link fence and next to a railroad track, without realizing that a big part of America's high-tech future is inside.

There is no sign outside to tell the public that it's the headquarters of Blue Origin, the private rocket company that aims to revolutionize the business and technology behind space travel.

Inside it's a much different story as engineers and machinists design, manufacture and assemble rockets that are meant to be used over and over and dramatically reduce the cost of future space flight  both for cargo deliveries and space tourism.

Florida Today

was one of a handful of media outlets on Tuesday granted a rare peek inside the headquarters of Blue Origin outside Seattle, as it prepares to break ground on a rocket manufacturing facility on Merritt Island in Brevard County, Fla. Florida also is in the running to win production of the company's powerful BE-4 rocket engines.

Blue Origin hopes to be ready to launch an orbital rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 36 by 2019. People could travel on suborbital flights on a Blue Origin craft next year.

Blue Origin's chief financial backer is billionaire Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com. He led the approximately three-hour tour and did most of the talking on subjects as arcane as fuel injectors and materials to his vision of what he wants for space.

Jeff Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin and chief executive officer of Amazon.com. (Photo: BLUE ORIGIN PHOTO)

""I want millions of people living and working in space,"" Bezos said at many points of his tour.

Blue Origin is a big facility that is part high-tech design center with drafting table-type desks for engineers and a cafeteria that overlooks the production floor. Memorabilia ranging from actual Apollo flight suits to models used in science-fiction movies such as Star Trek and Silent Running are displayed throughout.

On the production floor, specialized machinists work on multimillion-dollar lathes, milling machines and 3-D printers.

Bezos talks easily about the hard science behind the engineering that makes space travel not only possible, but cost-effective.

""All of our endeavors should be profitable,"" he said.

Among his many interests, space travel has held particular intrigue for Bezos since he was a child. Starting a company like Blue Origin to pursue that interest was for decades not in the realm of possibility.

Then I won this lottery ticket called Amazon.com. I can actually fulfill my childhood dream. Jeff Bezos

""Then I won this lottery ticket called Amazon.com,"" Bezos said. ""I can actually fulfill my childhood dream.""

His vision, like those on the team of Blue Origin, is to dramatically reduce the cost of space flight so there would be hundreds of launches a year, not dozens. The two engines the company's engineers are developing and refining, the BE-3 and BE-4, are intended to power its own designed spacecraft, as well as those of other companies. The engines could also end up on the Vulcan vehicle that United Launch Alliance is designing to replace the Atlas V.

The mantra following Blue Origin's successful suborbital launch and landing of its New Shepard rocket and crew capsule Jan. 22 from the company's private range in West Texas was ""Launch. Land. Repeat."" Bezos announced the test flight success in a blog post, revealing that it used the same suborbital New Shepard rocket and crew capsule the company launched and landed last November.

What he and the Blue Origin team seemed to find most fascinating  though not unexpected  was that there was relatively little work required to get the rocket ready for its next launch. Blue Origin crews never even removed the engine.

""This is pretty much the most awesome thing you can do,"" said Michael Krene, head of project development for the BE-4.

Gradatim Ferociter or ""step by step, ferociously. That's Blue Origin's motto meant to signify an aggressive, yet careful and methodical approach, in achieving its goals. Bezos quietly started Blue Origin in 2000 and it wasn't until three years later when he started purchasing property in West Texas that it became public.

Blue Origin's 260,000-square-foot facility, a modern structure of tan stone and glass, is about a 30-minute drive south from the headquarters of Amazon in Seattle  and the Microsoft Corp. headquarters in Redmond.

The 600 employees working at Blue Origin's Kent headquarters come from all over the USA and have been involved with NASA, or aerospace for decades. The operation at Cape Canaveral will add about 200.

All seem on board with the Bezos philosophy to be fast, but not to rush things.

""You get there faster when you take things step by step,"" said Bezos, casually dressed in blue jeans as walked the floor of Blue Origin's facility  which at one time built tunnel-building components for the England to France tunnel under the English Channel.

Bezos said he gets over to the facility at least once a week, usually Wednesdays.

""I'm deeply involved here,"" he said ""These things give me energy. They don't take away energy.""

Bezos and Blue Origin are known for being notoriously quiet, if not downright secretive when it comes to the company's operations and progress. Tuesday's peek behind the curtain at headquarters follows the company's latest successful suborbital launch.

He said it was time to allow more access because the company has reached a level where it felt there wasn't an overly large amount of hype associated with what the company wants to do.

Space is very easy to overhype. The ratio to attention to what you've actually done can be very extreme. Jeff Bezos

""Space is very easy to overhype,"" Bezos said. ""The ratio to attention to what you've actually done can be very extreme.""

United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket will use the more powerful BE-4. Also Orbital ATK could use it as an upper-state engine for a future rocket.

That leaves a key question that has states salivating: Where will Blue Origin decide to build the BE-4?

""The biggest question is a talented workforce,"" Bezos said, adding, ""then you want to go some place welcoming, that really wants the company.""

And Blue Origin is part of a group of commercial space companies working toward launches of space tourists on suborbital flights  Virgin Galactic, XCOR Aerospace  and NASA astronauts on orbital missions (Boeing, SpaceX) within two or three years.

As for Bezos, he said he plans to be a space tourist at some point, but he wants to do it his way. He had opportunities to launch from Russia but rejected that option. He wants to go on a Blue Origin vehicle.

""It's not what drives me,"" he said of personally flying into space. ""I do want to go and I will go.""

A recall of those new Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon and Chevrolet Malibu is in the works to replace to replace driver-side front airbags. Until the fix comes through, though, GM doesn't want any of them to be sold.

GM emphasized that the defect is not related to the ongoing recall of millions of air bags made by industry supplier Takata of Japan.

In GM's case, the fear is that the second stage of the airbag may not deploy properly under some conditions in high-speed crashes.

(Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)

NEW YORK  Shares of Crown Media Holdings (CRWN), which owns the Hallmark Channel, jumped 3.5% on Hallmark Cards' announcement that it will buy the company. But shareholders will have no say in the matter.

Hallmark, which is the largest manufacturer of greeting cards in the U.S., said it will pay $5.05 a share for the shares of Crown Media that it does not already own, representing a premium of 2.4% over the stock's closing price on Tuesday.

Crown Media shares jumped 3.5% to close at $5.10 on Wednesday, suggesting shareholders think they might eke out more from the greeting-card maker.

But Hallmark said it intends to assert its rights, under Delaware law, to a short-form merger. This will allow the company to bypass shareholder approval for the buyout because Hallmark already owns more than 90% of the company's outstanding common stock. This type of merger will also allow Hallmark to bypass approval by Crown's board.

In a letter to Crown Media's board, Hallmark said it taking the company over to ""realize benefits from its ownership of Crown that are unavailable to it while Crown remains a public company with minority stockholders.""

Among those benefits will be Hallmark's ability to direct Crown to make decisions based on ""what is best for Hallmark as a whole, without being constrained by public, minority stockholders at Crown,"" CEO Donald Hall told the board. Hallmark also plans to reduce costs by taking the company private, which Hall said will remove burdens on Crowns management associated with public reporting ""and other tasks resulting from Crowns public company status.""

The only requirement for the short form-merger, according to Hall, is that Hallmark mail a form to the holders of Crowns common stock at least 20 days prior to buying the stock for the price listed. Hallmark said it plans to file the required form ""shortly."" The company also said it reserves the right to abandon the merger ""at any time prior to completion.""

The Hallmark Channel runs shows like Cedar Grove, starring Andie MacDowell. It also runs cooking shows and reruns, like the Golden Girls. Crown Media also operates the Hallmark Movies and Mysteries television channel.

(Photo: Delpixart, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

More Americans rely more on Social Security for their income than on any other source. That makes it crucial to avoid making mistakes with your benefits. Yet with so much confusion about how Social Security works, it's easy to fall into a trap without even realizing it. Below, let's take a look at three key Social Security mistakes to avoid.

Thinking there's a one-size-fits-all strategy for when to take benefits

Most Americans take their Social Security at their earliest opportunity when they turn 62, and many financial experts argue that waiting longer before taking benefits is a smarter move. Yet the biggest trap you can fall into when it comes to the timing of taking your Social Security is following a blanket rule without actually applying it to your individual situation.

Many issues that are specific to your individual situation go into making smart Social Security decisions, and they defy oversimplified rules of thumb. A life-expectancy table might reduce a typical claiming situation to a mathematical formula, but applying your own personal medical and family history can change those equations dramatically. Simple dollar-value calculations don't incorporate your personal views on whether Social Security income early in your retirement has a greater quality-of-life value than greater amounts of income later in retirement. Having other income sources can give you more financial flexibility but also raises questions of having your benefits subject to income tax.

Knowing the pure financial aspects of the Social Security decision is important, but it's not determinative by itself. You also have to be able to apply your own facts and circumstances to come up with the best answer for you and your family.

Ignoring potential benefits for your family

One of those individual factors that can have a dramatic impact on the optimal claiming decision involves family members and the extent to which your decisions will affect them. If you're single with no eligible children to receive benefits on your work history, then you can make decisions taking only your own personal preferences into mind.

Those with family members who are eligible for Social Security face a different situation. For instance, if you claim early, then not only will your own monthly benefits be lower, but also any survivor benefits your spouse receives will also be reduced. Waiting longer will boost both your retirement benefits and a spouse's survivor benefits. In some cases, considering the bigger picture will lead you to make a different decision. In others, such as when your spouse already has an ample work history and will receive sizable benefits without relying on your work history, it's less likely to change your decision.

Again, your own personal preferences will dictate how much weight to put your family members' needs. Nevertheless, taking them into account is important if you intend that they'll play any role in your decision-making process.

Not keeping up with law changes

Social Security has seen big changes over the years, and out-of-date information can lead to bad planning. You don't want to think that you can take advantage of a strategy only to find out later that it's unavailable.

For instance, it used to be that you could change your mind about Social Security to an unlimited extent, withdrawing your application and repaying any benefits you had received. You could then file at a later date and get larger monthly payments. But in 2010, the Social Security Administration changed its rule, limiting the do-over option to the first 12 months after your initial claim for benefits.

More recently, the elimination of the file-and-suspend and FAASF strategies will have a huge impact on future retirees. Although grandfathering provisions will allow some to keep using these strategies, most younger people won't. If you don't update your Social Security claiming plans, then you could end up making a bad choice based on an outdated understanding of the law.

Figuring out how to get Social Security is hard, but knowing potential mistakes can be valuable. By steering clear of these three danger areas, you can make a more informed decision that reflects your own personal needs.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Cracking down on the press in Turkey,"['Est March', 'Special For Usa Today', 'Lucy Kafanov', 'A M']","Turkish anti riot police officers launch tear gas to disperse supporters of the Turkish Zaman Daily newspaper, who demonstrate outside the newspaper headquarters on March 4, 2016 in Istanbul. (Photo: Ozan Kose, AFP/Getty Images)

The images were shocking: Turkish police using bolt-cutters to break the steel gate in front of a newspaper office; a sea of demonstrators cowering under a cloud of teargas and blasts of water cannon; journalists helping an injured woman clad in a brightly-colored headscarf  her face streaked with blood and tears.

But for someone whos been closely following recent events in Turkey, it was hard to see the government takeover of the countrys highest-circulation newspaper in a midnight raid Friday as a surprise.

The seizure of Zaman, a leading opposition newspaper, is the latest salvo in a battle against two of the biggest perceived threats to President Recep Tayyip Erdogans government: opposition media and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric who has been accused of seeking to create a parallel state in Turkey.

Erdogan and Gulen are former allies who had a public falling out in 2013, when Gulen supporters in the police and judiciary launched a massive corruption probe that implicated top officials in the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. In the aftermath of the scandal, Erdogan, then prime minister, reassigned thousands of civil servants deemed loyal to Erdogan, while conducting raids against news organizations believed to be aligned with Gulen.

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has stressed that the government takeover of news group Feza Journalism  which owns Zaman  was the result of a court order and said he could not interfere because the matter was legal, not political. But the court gave no reason for greenlighting the takeover, and analysts say it is part of an ongoing onslaught on dissenting news media that marks a serious blow to the countrys press freedom.

By lashing out and seeking to rein in critical voices, President Erdogans government is steamrolling over human rights, says Andrew Gardner, an Amnesty International Turkey researcher. A free and independent media, together with the rule of law and independent judiciary, are the cornerstones of internationally guaranteed freedoms which are the right of everyone in Turkey.

Last year, a world press freedom index by Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 149th out of 180 countries. Dozens of Turkish journalists have been jailed and hundreds are facing criminal charges. In another prominent case, Turkey has sought life imprisonment for two Cumhuriyet newspaper journalists for reporting on Turkish weapons deliveries to Syrian rebels, accusing them of espionage and ties to the Gulen network.

Recent years have seen independent broadcasters shut down or their channels removed from the main satellite distribution platforms. Last weekend, the pro-Kurdish television channel IMC was taken off air  accused of broadcasting terrorist propaganda by showing the fallout from clashes between Kurdish insurgents and Turkish security forces in the southeast.

Meanwhile, thousands of social media users have faced charges in court for posting content deemed critical of the government or Erdogan.

The crackdown comes at a time when independent reporting in Turkey is more critical than ever. The country is straining under the weight of more than 2 million Syrian refugees and appears to be on the brink of civil war as it battles Kurdish separatists near its southern border.

Islamic State militants have been blamed for a string of bloody attacks on Turkish soil in recent months. The turmoil has shaken Turkeys once-booming economy, sending the lira tumbling.

The bedrock of any democratic system is information. But instead of encouraging political debate and open public dialogue, Turkish authorities have fostered a climate of intimidation and paranoia. The message for independent voices is loud and clear: toe the line, or face the consequences.

Simpson estate,"['Doug Stanglin', 'Est March', 'P M']","The Los Angles Police Department confirmed Friday that it is doing analysis on a knife that was purportedly found buried on the property of OJ Simpson's home when it was being demolished in 1998. (March 4) AP

Los Angeles police confirmed Friday that homicide investigators are examining a knife purportedly found years ago on the property where O.J. Simpson was living at the time his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman were killed in 1994.

Capt. Andrew Neiman said a construction worker purportedly found the knife buried on the Simpson estate in Brentwood in the 1990s and apparently handed it to an off-duty or retired LAPD officer who was providing security during the filming of a movie nearby.

Neiman, cautioning the story could be ""bogus from the get-go,"" said police learned of the existence of the knife ""in the last month"" and recovered it from the now-retired officer. The Simpson house was demolished in 1998 by a new owner.

Nieman, speaking to reporters at a news conference, declined to further describe the knife or identify the retired officer.

He said it was already being examined by experts and would be tested for any hair or DNA samples it might yield. He did not say how long the testing would take.

It was not clear why the officer did not come forward earlier, but Neiman said it was his understanding the officer may have erroneously thought the case of the double homicide was closed.

I was really surprised, Neiman said. I would think that an LAPD officer would know that any time you come into contact with evidence, you should and shall submit that to investigators.

He said it was unlikely the officer would face any administrative charges because he is retired and is no longer working for the LAPD. Neiman said police do not know the identity of the person who turned over the knife and asked him or her to come forward.

Simpson's 35-year-old ex-wife and Goldman, a 25-year-old waiter, were found stabbed to death around midnight on June 13, 1994 outside her home, also in Brentwood, not far from the Simpson estate. Simpson was acquitted of the killings, but the case itself remains open.

In 1997, a civil court jury found Simpson liable for the slayings and awarded millions of dollars in damages to families of the victims.

Famed lawyer F. Lee Bailey, who was a member of the Simpson defense team, told Boston's FOX 25 the report of a knife found on Simpson's estate is ""ridiculous.""

""O.J. did not drop (the knife) on his property any more than he did the gloves,"" Bailey said. ""The whole thing is ridiculous.""

A glove found on the property was key evidence presented by the prosecution, which alleged Simpson dropped it after purportedly jumping a fence on the property in a rush home after the killings.

In any case, Bailey noted, double jeopardy would prevent Simpson being charged again for the killings. ""All of the matters have been adjudicated,"" he said. ""The matter is closed.""

Marcia Clark, one of the prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson trial, said no one knows yet whether the knife is real evidence.

""It might be a hoax, it might be somebody who planted it and then just pretended to find it and gave it to the off-duty police officer, you don't know,"" Clark tells ETonline.com. ""But, of course, I'm glad the LAPD is taking it seriously and subjecting it to testing so we can find out.""

Simpson, 68, is serving time in a Nevada prison for an armed robbery conviction in 2008 in a bizarre case in which he and a group of cohorts in Las Vegas recovered, at gunpoint, sports memorabilia that Simpson said was stolen from him.

The discovery of the knife was initially reported Friday morning by TMZ, which described it as a ""folding buck knife.""

Quoting unidentified law enforcement sources, TMZ reported the retired officer recently contacted a friend in the LAPD Robbery Homicide Division because he was planning to frame the knife and wanted to engrave it with the departmental record number from the Brown-Simpson murder case.

TMZ says the friend ""was indignant"" and reported the incident to his superiors.

usatoday.com,2016-02-24 00:00:00,Educators do little time for sex crimes,"['A M', 'Est February', 'Jen Zettel']","Wisconsin educators who face criminal charges for sexual relationships or abuse of students often take plea deals and rarely serve more than a year in prison.

Clockwise from top left, Daniel Markofski, Nathan Cox, Ryan Zellner and Andrea Ebert. The former educators are on Wisconsin's sex offender registry after they were convicted of sexual offenses involving children. (Photo: Courtesy of the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry) Story Highlights Educators convicted of sexual or physical abuse crimes against students often take plea deals.

When convicted, they rarely spend more than a year in prison.

Legal officials say a person's criminal history, the victim's feelings and more go into sentencing.

Judges feel they can protect the public by imposing long probation periods with many conditions.

Wisconsin educators convicted of inappropriate relationships or abuse of students often plead down from more serious charges and rarely serve more than a year in prison, a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation has found.

Three recent cases near Fond du Lac, Green Bay and Milwaukee illustrate how plea deals lead to lesser penalties. Several more cases of teacher misconduct involving sexual allegations over the last decade show a similar trend, based on a database of all Wisconsin teachers whose licenses were revoked.

The findings are part of USA TODAY NETWORK's ongoing nationwide investigation of how states handle teacher misconduct.

Legal officials and the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction say the convictions did what they were designed to do  hold teachers accountable and keep dangerous educators out of Wisconsin classrooms.

""The bottom line is sometimes (a plea) is necessary. Every single case can't go to trial. If every single case went to trial our system would collapse. We have too many,"" said Alex Duros, an assistant district attorney in Outagamie County.

Crossing the line

Michael Burman, a former teacher at Horace Mann High School in North Fond du Lac, was charged in Fond du Lac County in February 2007 with 10 counts of sexual assault by school staff and 10 counts of child enticement. He had a relationship with a 17-year-old student that included more than 70 sexual encounters, many of which happened at school, the criminal complaint said.

Burman faced more than 300 years in prison for the 20 felonies.

RELATED: State backlog lets educators keep licenses

Instead, he took a plea deal, and was convicted on two counts of causing mental harm to a child. Eight counts of sexual assault of a student by school staff and 10 counts of child enticement were dismissed and read into the record at his sentencing.

Burman received six months in jail, was ordered to pay restitution and was placed on probation for five years.

The girl involved in the case testified in court and shed tears when she heard the terms of Burman's sentence, according to archives from The Reporter in Fond du Lac.

Deals usually mean less jail time

Burman isn't the only former educator to make waves and fade quietly into the background afterward.

A Milwaukee County judge dismissed charges against Emily L. Patterson, a former Mukwonago High School teacher and Brown Deer High School girls' soccer coach, in 2010. Patterson was charged with sex assault of a student by school staff after she had a relationship with a 16-year-old girl on the soccer team. She was no longer a coach when the case began. The judge dismissed the charge because she wasn't a school employee or volunteer as defined by state statute, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

Andrea L. Ebert, a former teacher at Rice Lake Middle School, was sentenced to six months in jail, three years' probation and 500 hours of community service in a 2012 Barron County Case. Ebert was convicted of sex assault of a student by school staff  a felony  and a misdemeanor count of sex with a child age 16 or older.

Christopher Wieber, a former Bay Port High School teacher, was charged with sexual assault of a student by school staff and child enticement in Brown County in 2013. He accepted a plea deal, and was convicted of causing mental harm to a child. He was sentenced to a year in jail with work release privileges and six years of probation.

Daniel S. Markofski, a longtime Wisconsin educator, was a principal at an Illinois school at the time of his 2008 arrest in Milwaukee County. He was sentenced to one year in prison and 18 months of extended supervision on two counts of exposing a child to harmful material and a misdemeanor count of sex with a child age 16 or under. Parents at the Illinois school where Markofski was a principal ""were upset"" with his sentence, considering the charges he faced carried more jail time, the Northwest Herald of Crystal Lake, Ill. reported. The Milwaukee County judge who sentenced him, John Franke, resigned in late 2008 for reasons unrelated to the Markofski case, the Northwest Herald story said.

Nathan E. Cox, a former Prairie Farm Middle School teacher, was sentenced to one year in prison and four years of extended supervision after he was convicted of child enticement-sexual contact with a student in Barron County in 2007.

Judges doled-out harsher sentences for particularly heinous cases, records show.

Ryan Zellner, a former Kiel High School teacher, was sentenced to 15 years in prison, 18 years of extended supervision and three years of probation in Manitowoc County in 2010. He assaulted 11 girls in three counties over an eight-year period. Zellner agreed to a plea deal, which took 17 charges off the table, including one count of second-degree sexual assault of a child. Zellner pled no contest to 11 charges  all of them felonies  including child enticement-sexual contact and sex assault of a student by school staff.

Weighing the options

Case law emphasizes rehabilitation over incarceration, which explains why a defendant may not serve considerable jail time, but face a lengthy probation term with many conditions, said Outagamie County Circuit Judge Nancy Krueger.

If the crime involves a child victim, Krueger said judges typically prohibit the defendant from volunteering or working with children as a condition of probation. Other requirements could include completing sex offender treatment, registering as a sex offender and limiting, or eliminating, access to computers and the Internet.

""A judge may feel in a particular case  if it's unlikely the offense is going to occur again  that if (the offender) is being supervised and also serves some time in jail as punishment that the combination will work to protect the public,"" she said.

RELATED: Broken discipline tracking system lets teachers flee troubled pasts

State law automatically requires people who have been convicted of sexual offenses involving children to register as sex offenders. Those crimes include sexual assault of a child, child enticement-sexual contact, sexual assault of a student by school staff and exposing a child to harmful material. A judge also could order sex offender registration if the crime doesn't require it.

Judges consider many factors when ruling on sexual assault cases, including a defendant's criminal record and character  along with the impact the crime had on the victim.

With sex assault cases involving students and teachers, the offenders usually haven't committed similar crimes in the past, Krueger said.

""It depends on the particular case, and they're not easy cases for a judge to handle at sentencing,"" Krueger said. ""A lot of times the victim will not show up in court, so you only hear the victim's story from either a letter they write to you or from their conversations with the probation agent who wrote the pre-sentence report, so that can make it a little more difficult, too.""

The facts of each case affect whether prosecutors offer the defendant a plea agreement, said Duros, the assistant district attorney. Sometimes, sexual assault cases look clear-cut when police refer charges, but information gets murky when prosecutors do more digging.

Prosecutors may try to lock in a conviction by amending charges and having others dismissed and read in to the record when an offender is sentenced.

""We have a humongous burden at a jury trial, it's beyond a reasonable doubt. It's the biggest burden in our court system, and every time we take a case to trial it's a risk because oftentimes  especially in these sexual assault cases  we don't have a lot of corroborating evidence,"" he said. ""Usually it's a 'he-said, she-said' case and by amending it down and creating this plea bargain we assure a conviction.""

Crimes against children

Wisconsin's Chapter 948 Statutes deal exclusively with crimes against children, such as abuse, neglect, sexual assault and enticement.

They're all felonies, and educators convicted of such crimes lose their teaching licenses, said Tom McCarthy, a DPI spokesman.

Even though Burman was not convicted of sexual assault of a student by school staff or child enticement, he was guilty of two Chapter 948 crimes. Causing mental harm to a child is a felony that carries a maximum prison sentence of 1212 years and fines up to $25,000.

He  and every other teacher mentioned above  lost their teaching licenses as a result of their criminal cases, according to the DPI's online licensor portal.

The reality of the justice system is every case can't go to trial, but there are mechanisms in the law that allow prosecutors to keep offenders from getting off the hook, Duros said.

""We call it a legal fiction  maybe they didn't cause mental harm to a child, but it's a way for us to use the legal system to hold people accountable, to do something that's in the best interest of the victim, to do something that the suspect thinks is in the best interest for him and that's in the best interest of society to make sure this person is held accountable,"" he said.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Trudeau state visit marks emerging 'special relationship' with Canada,"['Est March', 'Gregory Korte', 'P M']","In this Nov. 19, 2015 file photo, President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stand up following their bilateral meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila, Philippines. The White House says Trudeau will attend a state dinner on March 10 in a visit intended to boost ties between the neighboring countries. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)

WASHINGTON  The last time the White House hosted a Canadian state dinner was 19 years ago, when Democrat Bill Clinton was president and Liberal Jean Chretien was prime minister. They hit it off so well that, during a round of golf in 1995, they conspired to end with a tie score  a ""truly symbolic, ego-overriding manifestation of the equal partnership between the United States and Canada,"" Clinton later quipped.

For most of George W. Bush's presidency, liberals controlled Ottawa, and for most of Obama's, it was the conservatives.

But now, the personalities and politics have aligned. And while President Obama and the new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, have met only once, their chemistry seems to have ushered in a renewal of a cooperative relationship that Washington can sometimes take for granted.

""There is a developing special relationship between this president and the prime minister  both young leaders with similar visions,"" said Mark Feierstein, an Obama adviser on foreign affairs in the Western Hemisphere. ""Both have a progressive vision of governing. Both are very much committed to the appropriate use of multilateral tools. Both are committed to diversity. And I think there is a coincidence very much in terms of the agendas that both administrations have.""

Tops on the agenda: Climate. As neighboring Arctic nations, the Obama and Trudeau administrations are presenting a united front in global climate talks on a number of fronts, including hydrofluorocarbons and aviation emissions.

""They have already shown that theyre an ambitious and committed partner in the fight against climate change,"" said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy for climate change.

There are some points of contention, largely on trade. Both countries are in the middle of a one-year time-out on a decades-old softwood lumber dispute, in which the United States accuses Canada of unfairly subsidizing its lumber industry. Canada is also a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and both leaders are working to tamp down internal criticism of the deal from within their own parties.

""I dont think Canada-U.S. relations were poor previously. You tend to have to grade the way Canada and the U.S. are working together by shades of good. It never really gets bad,"" said Gordon Giffin, the former U.S. ambassador to Canada in the Clinton administration. ""I think the whole Keystone pipeline debate in some measure hijacked the public attention round the U.S.-Canada relationship. It certainly hijacked the press attention.""

But then the election of Trudeau last October  replacing the conservative Stephen Harper, who had made approval of the Alberta-to-Nebraska oil pipeline a key issue in his dealings with Washington  made it easier for Obama to reject the pipeline in November. The two leaders first met at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila a few weeks later, where Obama extended the invitation.

State visits are only partly about bilateral meetings, joint press conferences and agendas. They're also social affairs, and the 44-year-old Trudeau brings an air of international glamour rarely seen even at the White House. Trudeau's father, Pierre, was a two-time prime minister of Canada. His wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, is a television personality who eschews the title ""first lady"" but has drawn comparisons to Jackie Kennedy.

Thursday's state visit will feature a formal arrival ceremony with a review of the troops, a joint news conference, lunch with Secretary of State John Kerry and a formal state dinner in the evening. First lady Michelle Obama's office released a menu for the 200-plate dinner that includes Alaskan Halibut casserole, baby short ribs and Yukon potatoes drizzled with Canadian whisky. Singer Sara Bareilles will provide the entertainment.

Since President Coolidge hoisted the Canadian governor-general in 1927, Canadian state dinners were held pretty consistently every decade, so the 19-year-hiatus since the last state dinner was notable. (Prime Minister Paul Martin did host Bush at a state dinner in Ottawa in 2004.)

That can sometimes lead to a feeling from Ottawa that the United States takes the relationship for granted  despite a $1.3 trillion trade relationship, a 1,933-mile border and a military relationship so integrated that American and Canadian generals take turns commanding a shared airspace defense command.

""I used to kid the Canadians, 'You're the wheel that doesnt squeak. We can only pay attention to squeaking wheels,'"" Giffin said.

SAN FRANCISCO  Intel took another step into what CEO Brian Krzanich has called the digitization of sports with the purchase of Israeli 3D video technology firm Replay Technologies on Wednesday.

Intel has been focusing on finding new technologies that make use of its chips and has been working with Tel Aviv-based Replay since 2013. The company's technology was part of Krzanich's keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.

Intel did not say how much it planned to pay for the company, but Israeli newspaper Haaretz put it at $175 million.

The Replay team will focus on advancing its technology with Intel to deliver faster video processing and new features, senior vice president of Intel Wendell Brooks said in a blog post.

Technology now plays an unprecedented role in sports ... and were just getting started, he said.

Intel plans to build out a new category of sports entertainment that it calls immersive sports, aimed at both fans and athletes and coaches because of its ability to capture, analyze and share data, Brooks wrote.

Replay was founded in 2011 and last month raised $13.5 million in funding. Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, also holds a stake in the company.

At an NBA All-Star weekend in February, Intel used Replays free dimensional or freeD video on TV and online. The tech creates a seamless 3D video rendering of the court using 28 ultrahigh-definition cameras positioned around the arena and connected to Intel-based servers. This system allowed broadcasters to give fans a 360-degree view of key plays, Brooks wrote.

Replay won an Emmy award in 2014 for its technical work with the New York Yankees baseball team.

Jason Pierre-Paul (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)

The New York Giants are betting $8.5 million  at least  that Jason Pierre-Paul can return to his old form in 2016.

The one-year contract Pierre-Paul agreed to Tuesday included a $4.25 million signing bonus and a fully guaranteed base salary of $4.25 million, according to details obtained by USA TODAY Sports.

Pierre-Paul also has a $300,000 workout bonus and can earn a total of $1.2 million in per-game active roster bonuses, meaning he can make $10 million before even triggering $500,000 in incentives tied to sacks.

Thats a far less incentive-driven deal than Pierre-Paul, 27, had to take last year, when he lost a finger in a July 4 fireworks accident after sitting out offseason workouts because he hadnt signed his franchise tag.

Pierre-Paul returned to play in eight games, registering just one sack. But he wrote in an Instagram post Wednesday that he had interest on the open market, specifically thanking the Arizona Cardinals.

Now, he can be up to $10.5 million richer before he hits the market again next March.

Fantasy football outlook

Murray, 28, will be the starting running back for the Titans and receive a majority of the carries. He struggled in 2015 with the Eagles but should play better with the Titans.

Unfortunately, better play wont be hard to achieve from a fantasy perspective.

Its not 2014 in Dallas anymore. Focus on the present: Hes two years older, first off. Another system that runs a quasi-form of the read-option, plus his lengthy injury history, shouldnt excite fantasy owners too much. Tennessees offensive line is solid enough  and likely to be improved in the NFL draft  but with quarterback Marcus Mariota still learning, Murrays upside is capped.

Let someone else take on all of the risk that doesnt add up to a likely reward. Hes a palatable RB2 for the strong-stomached types, and may be overvalued by owners stuck in 2014. He wont lead the league in rushing again, but Murray has an outside shot at being a weekly fantasy utility.

The real winner of this deal is Eagles running back Ryan Mathews, who could author a strong showing in a PPR-friendly West Coast offense under new head coach Doug Pederson. Specialty back Darren Sproles creeps back into flex territory in reception-rewarding setups.",[]

While discussing Miesha Tates five-round submission victory over Holly Holm, White said he feels sorry for Holm and that her manager didnt know what he was doing when he booked the fight, according to ESPNs Brett Okamoto.

White said:

The sad part about that is, listen, hes an old boxing guy who thinks hes smart, and hes not, White said during an appearance on ESPNs Russillo & Kanell. Its one of those things. I feel bad about it. I feel bad for Holly. I dont know if Holly really knows what she lost. I think she has so much faith in the people that surround her, she feels like, Well, they got me this far. We had this meeting, and Holly wasnt even in it. Holly, thats your life. You should be in that meeting. Dont leave it to these people. Anyway, Holly made a lot of money. She accomplished great things, she beat Ronda Rousey. But it could have been so much bigger for her, and the sad part is, I dont think she even knows it.

Okamoto reported that ESPN then reached out to Holms manager, Lenny Fresquez, who said that Holm made the ultimate decision and acknowledged that Tate had a solid fight. Fresquez added that right now Holm wants to fight both Tate and Ronda Rousey as soon as possible, but he said that a Holm vs. Rousey matchup would have more glamour.

However, what Fresquez wants most likely will not happen. White already told SportsCenter who he believes will face-off in the next bantamweight championship fight, per MMA Junkie:

When you have to call your best friend to develop an escape plan as soon as your date goes to the bathroom, you know its not a good match. Even if Tinder, a popular dating app, disagrees.

Ashley Fields, a freshman at Indiana University, landed in that exact situation after agreeing to meet one of her Tinder matches.

It just kept getting more awkward as the night went on...he was so different in person, says Fields, whose best friend conveniently called her with an emergency so she could escape her Tinder disaster.

But lets take a step back from this not-so-happy ending. How could a dating app end up creating such a bad match?

Tinder syncs with your Facebook and lets you like or dislike other users based on their profiles. If they like you back, its a match, which allows you to message each other. But if you like someone and they dont like you back, you are not notified. The app doesnt notify you of rejection, only praise.

Its definitely a huge ego boost, Fields says. Although she used the app daily when she first downloaded Tinder, Fields deleted it after her awkward date.

But not every Tinder match ends in a date disaster story for college students. Fifty percent of Tinder users are 18 to 24. Among these young users is Amanda Fallon, a recent graduate of the University of Southern California who has been dating someone she met on Tinder for the past five months.

He seemed different to me than other guys on there. He seemed real and he was actually interested in talking to me, Fallon says.

Fallons Tinder match came to see her perform with her a cappella group just two weeks after the pair met. They have been seeing each other ever since.

Fallon feels the app helped her form relationships during her transition into adulthood.

Its hard to meet people when you first graduate... in normal life, we stick with who we know and its hard to meet anyone new. Thats why Tinder is so exciting for me.

The apps popularity among young adults is no surprise to Tinder CEO Sean Rad, since he originally marketed the app toward college students.

We felt we were solving a core human issue, and the truest test of that was if Tinder could give value to people in a very social environment like a college, because then we knew we could be of value to everybody, Rad says.

Rad and co-founder Justin Mateen both attended the University of Southern California and their college experiences unveiled the need for an easier way to connect students with one another.

Since Tinder was created to help people form relationships, the hookup stigma associated with the app wasnt exactly what Tinders creators had in mind.

Tinder was never intended to be a hookup app. Less than 8% of our users think of it as such. We get emails daily of people getting engaged who met on Tinder, Mateen says.

Users like Fallon who have had success with the app tend to agree.

[People are] afraid to let it be more than a hookup app because its safer to say we hooked up and nothing came from it than to realize you went on a couple dates with someone and the guy stopped talking to you.

Rad hopes to see a future where students see someone theyd like to meet and they immediately take out their phones to find the person on Tinder. Considering the 6 million matches created on Tinder per day, according to Mateen, that future doesnt seem too far from reality.

Rather than finding someone in your classroom, youre meeting people on Tinder and meeting up with them offline. Meeting someone on Tinder is like meeting them in real life because our phones have become an extension of who we are, Mateen says.

Unfortunately for Fields, her recent match resulted in Tinder turmoil. But for the millions of new users engaging in the Tinder takeover every day, true love may be just a match away.

I was his first and last Tinder date. Im excited to see where this goes. I forget we even met on Tinder.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Brutal night for media narrative,"['Est March', 'A M', 'Rem Rieder']","Hillary Clinton was thought to have had a double digit lead over Bernie Sanders heading into the Michigan primary. VPC

It was a brutal night for the media narrative, the polls, the pundits, the conventional wisdom.

The Democratic presidential contest was pretty much over, the story went. Bernie Sanders had peaked, the Hillary Clinton juggernaut was in full command, Clinton would beat Sanders by 20 points in Michigan. Game over. Time for the party to unite and for Clinton to pivot toward the general election and the looming threat posed by Donald Trump.

Except, wait. The Republican establishment at long last had come together to take the party back. Mitt Romney  Mitt Romney!!  had ridden to the rescue. Trump was slowing down, his national lead was shrinking.

Then, on Tuesday, those pesky voters got in the way.

Turns out Clinton's double-digit lead in Michigan was gossamer. Sanders won the state, albeit narrowly, cutting into Clinton's overwhelming lead with black voters while maintaining his dominance among young voters and prevailing among independents.

Postpone the coronation. Sanders isn't going away quite yet. Cue the Rumsfeldian long, hard slog.

The punditocracy seemed convinced that a couple of Sanders moments in the Sunday night debate  ""Excuse me, I'm talking,"" his ghetto gaffe  would turn off Michiganders. Apparently not so much.

Michigan, of course, doesn't change the overall shape of the contest. The math continues to favor Clinton. Her delegate lead is substantial, and she won big in Mississippi.

But make no mistake: Michigan was an embarrassment for her, and a shock. And next week's battles include some that appear to be on favorable terrain for the Vermont socialist, in states such as Ohio and Missouri.

And Trump? All the establishment angst, the stop-Trump PACs, the Romney intervention, the agonized David Brooks columns can't make him go away.

The Trumpmobile had little trouble navigating those establishment speed bumps. Trump went three for four, handily winning Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii while Sen. Ted Cruz prevailed in Idaho.

Less successful were the cable networks, which couldn't bring themselves to tear away from The Donald's endless and truly bizarre infomercial  Trump steaks! Trump wine! Paul O'Neill!  even when Clinton started speaking. CNN's Ed O'Keefe says given how things were going in Michigan, that might have been just fine with Clinton. But seriously!

As you may have noticed, this is not the first time that the media political narrative has been way off. There are a number of things at play here. One is the obsession with polls, the ubiquitous polls. This isn't new, but there seem to be so many of them this time, and they play a  excuse the expression  huge role in shaping the analysis. They are valuable, but they are not gospel, as Michigan reminds us.

At best they are reflections of how people are thinking at a moment in time, not predictors of how things will play out. But it's easy to forget that, and we often do.

Throw in the very high interest in this year's campaign, particularly among Republicans, whose voter turnout is off the charts; the inexhaustible appetites of cable and digital for more, more, more; and the very human yearning to tie things up neatly, and you get what we have.

Tuesday night's results also contained very bad news for a candidate who has figured prominently in another seemingly misguided piece of narrative, Sen. Marco Rubio. Remember all the talk about the ""lanes""? No, not Diane Lane, Penny Lane, Nathan Lane and Night Train Lane, but the idea that there was an establishment lane to the nomination, and Rubio had a good chance to occupy it.

Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio speaks to supporters at Sanford International Airport in Florida on March 7, 2016. (Photo: Cristobal Herrera, European Pressphoto Agency)

Rubio has been a darling of the politico/media complex. As recently as early February, Politico ran a story headlined, ""GOP establishment rallies behind Rubio.""

Trouble is, Rubio has drastically and consistently underperformed at the polls, winning only in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Tuesday was his nadir, as he couldn't crack double figures in Michigan or Mississippi. He's holding out for a win in his home state of Florida next Tuesday, but his prospects there don't seem great.

But, then, you know those polls ...

usatoday.com,2016-02-13 00:00:00,How to look up the background of teachers in every state,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Steve Reilly']","A USA TODAY and TEGNA Media investigation examines how teachers with checkered pasts are able to start fresh by crossing state lines. VPC

In Florida, parents can check out discipline actions taken against educators and, in most cases, see detailed documents about the events leading to the state's action against a teacher. (Photo: USA TODAY)

Nearly every state education agency provides a system that parents and members of the public can use to verify and review the credentials of public school teachers in the state.

However, the quality and scope of available information varies from state to state, and there is no way for the public to conduct a nationwide search for disciplinary histories of teachers.

Searchable lists of disciplinary actions taken against teachers are not available online in many states, and only a few states publicly post complete documents providing details about why a teacher's credentials were suspended or revoked.

All states are members of the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification, a non-profit organization that collects information on disciplined teachers in a nationwide database and makes the data available to state education agencies. However, that information is not available to the public.

To help parents and the public sort through the maze of state information, USA TODAY has compiled a state-by-state listing of resources that take you directly to tools you can use to review educator backgrounds. In states that haven't provided adequate online tools for accessing these public records, we've provided contact information for education officials so you can inquire about specific teachers or urge the state to post its records online.

(Photo: Elsa, Getty Images)

NEW YORK-- Wells Fargo was charged with fraud Monday tied to a now-defunct video game company founded by former Red Sox pitcher and three-time World Series champion Curt Schilling.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said the San Francisco bank failed to disclose an important financial gap facing Schilling's startup, 38 Studios, to bond investors who lost money in the high-profile 2012 collapse. The civil complaint, filed in Rhode Island federal court, also charges the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (RIEDC), a state agency, with defrauding the same municipal bond investors.

The SEC alleged that a bond offering document produced by Wells Fargo and RIEDC failed to disclose that 38 Studios had conveyed that it needed at least $75 million in funding to produce a particular video game.

A subsequent $75 million bond offering resulted in a $50 million loan to 38 Studios, leaving the company with a $25 million gap to produce its game, the SEC said. The remaining money raised was used to pay expenses and to establish a reserve fund and a capitalized interest fund, the SEC said.

When 38 Studios failed to to obtain additional financing to close the gap, the company defaulted on the loan.

The company's closure made headlines due to Schilling's status as a star pitcher, television commentator and 2001 World Series MVP. He has said he lost $50 million personally on the venture.

""We allege that the RIEDC and Wells Fargo knew that 38 Studios needed an additional $25 million to fund the project yet failed to pass that material information along to bond investors,"" said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. ""Municipal issuers and underwriters must provide investors with a clear-eyed view of the risks involved in an economic development project being financed through bond offerings, Ceresney said.

The SEC also charged Wells Fargos lead banker on the deal, Peter M. Cannava, and two former RIEDC executives, Keith W. Stokes and James Michael Saul, with aiding and abetting the fraud. Stokes and Saul have agreed to settle the charges without admitting the allegations. They have each agreed to pay a $25,000 penalty and are prohibited from participating in future municipal securities offerings.

""The complaint is riddled with factual inaccuracies,"" said Cannava's lawyer Brian Kelly of Nixon Peabody. ""And with regard to Mr. Cannava, they are trying to scapegoat a mid-level banker instead of holding the politicians responsible for this mess,"" he said.

Wells Fargo disputes the SEC's allegations in connection with the placement of these municipal bonds. We will respond to the specific allegations in the complaint in court, said spokesman Alan Elias.

The RIEDC, which is now called the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, said they are still reviewing the filing, but expressed concerns that the actions taken occurred under a previous administration.

""The Commerce Corporation, in its own lawsuit, has alleged that Wells Fargo, Keith Stokes, and Michael Saul failed to disclose material information about the 38 Studios deal to the former Economic Development Corporations board of directors and to investors. Todays filing makes consistent allegations,"" said Kayla Rosen, spokesperson for Commerce.

USA TODAY Sports went back and forth between two terrific candidates and eventually chose Michigan State guard Denzel Valentine as its National Player of the Year.

This version of Denzel Valentine  this best-player-in-the-country type  is not the version of Denzel Valentine who showed up on campus four years ago. Hes a much better shooter. Hes a much better leader. Hes a much better defender. And hes in much better shape.

Each offseason, Valentine made lists of goals he wanted to accomplish to get better in some facet of his game. The lists used to be longer than they became as he grew older. But he made sure to check each item off, whether it required endless hours in the gym with his older brother, Drew, or making the smart choice for dinner instead of the more delicious one. Superstars arent made in the spotlight; theyre made when no one is watching.

Valentine built himself into one of the best players in the country, checklist by checklist. Step by step. Offseason by offseason.

It's like the self-made millionaire compared to the inherited one, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. He's a self-made player, so I can't take much credit. He's made himself into this kind of player with everything he's done every offseason. ... I've just kind of seen him grow in every area and that's one thing I would say to an NBA team. Some guys come in with all the hype and are one-year wonders.

He's proven that he's gotten better every year in almost every aspect. Offense, defense, rebounding, passing, shooting, leadership-wise, even body-wise. He's covered more things than any player I've seen.

Valentine might become the first player since the assist has been kept as an official stat to finish the season averaging 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Izzo thinks Valentines rebounding numbers would be even higher had he not had to move him over to play point due to teammate injuries. But in the same breath, Izzo touts Valentines versatility  to do that, and still not skip a beat, still make his teammates better.

Thats not easy to do, Izzo said. I'm not trying to make it like a running back playing quarterback, but it's definitely not a smooth transition in a lot of different things. It took him a couple games to adjust to it and we took a couple of hits there. ... I think he's the most versatile player I've seen in years.

So while Oklahomas Buddy Hield has also been sensational  Izzo agrees with that, too  and deserves all the National Player of the Year talk hes getting, we give the edge to Valentine for both his versatility and the impact he has not just on the game but on his teammates, too, in Michigan States biggest games to date.

Hes not quite a self-made millionaire, but hes a self-made Player of the Year.

Why jet to Austin, Texas, for the famed South By Southwest music festival when there's so much music to be experienced along the way? With that thought in mind, the hosts of USA TODAY's Dad Rock podcast rented a vintage Airstream trailer and hit the highway Tuesday morning. The 1,500 journey, starting in the Washington, D.C., area, will include stops in Asheville, N.C.; Nashville; Memphis; and Dallas. We'll explore the musical spirit of each city, visiting the coolest places and talking to musicians as we go.

So be sure to check back throughout the week as we update our adventure with new podcasts, articles, videos and photos.

Let's start with a couple of videos we shot before setting off on this adventure.

First, here's a quick tour of ""Lucy,"" the restored 1964 Airstream trailer that will serve as Dad Rock home base:

First day on the Dad Rock road trip was a looooong one. We set off from the USA TODAY offices in Northern Virginia at 7 a.m. ET, with Lucy the Airstream in tow, made minimal stops (coffee, gas and down-home cooking at Judy's Family Diner in Wytheville, Va.) and rolled into Asheville around 5 p.m.

First impressions: Asheville is an eclectic oasis. Seems like every storefront is a local business just dripping in character. Very artsy. A perfect environment for music to flourish.

We met up with Emily Patrick, entertainment reporter for the Asheville Citizen-Times (part of the USA TODAY NETWORK), who served as our tour guide for the evening. We visited:

Appalachian Strings, run by a local craftsman who makes his type of instrument that is a variation on the dulcimer.

Asheville FM, an independent community radio station (and host Tom Peters put us on air!).

And the Grey Eagle, which has been one of Asheville's top live music venues for 22 years (caught some of the Luther Dickinson show and got an impromptu interview too; audio coming soon).

Check out the video of our adventure:

The loss capped off a miserable year that saw the Eagles go 0-18 in conference play, and the 19th conference loss put an end to it.

After the game, Boston College senior Dennis Clifford gave perhaps the saddest quote in the history of sad press conference quotes.

From ESPN:

Afterward, Clifford was asked what his best memory of playing college basketball will be. He choked up and put his head down, pausing for more than 20 seconds. When he looked back up, his face was red, his eyes were welling. His answer: Going out to eat.

Its a devastating response, though one thats not entirely fair  if you watch the video, it looks like Clifford wants to keep saying more but couldnt get the words out.",[]

It was the spring of 1982, and we were in the midst of a whirlwind feminist revolution. Yet for all of our progress, half the population was still being ignored. In the House of Representatives, the Democrats had elected a handful of rising stars beginning to make themselves heard nationally. But not one single woman in the Democratic Party had ever been elected in her own right to the U.S. Senate.

That, I decided, had to change.

My friends, co-workers and I began calling on friends and family to donate to Harriett Woods 1982 Senate campaign in Missouri. But the same day she pulled into a tie with the incumbent Sen. John Danforth, she ran out of money. On Election Day in November, Harriett lost by a mere 26,200 votes out of 1.5 million.

The lesson of Harrietts loss was painful but immediately apparent to all of us. Rather than stew, we did something about it. In the winter of 1983, feminist political advocate Lael Stegall suggested I host a breakfast for a small group of activists who, like her, were working to elect women to office. We met in a private room upstairs at the Tabard Inn, a quaint tavern near Dupont Circle. Our goal was clear: We wanted to elect a woman to the Senate, a Democrat who was not appointed and did not succeed a spouse but who ran and won on her own.

We all agreed that it came down to one thing: money, specifically early money that could be leveraged into real credibility that would generate additional funds later on. If our candidates had more seed money, they could begin building a campaign organization, field their own polls and create a strategy for victory  all of which would persuade the traditional funders to support them.

A few days later, we had a name: EMILYs List, for early money is like yeast. After all, what does yeast do? It makes the dough rise.

We started off with three goals. First, we wanted at least 1,000 members. Second, we wanted our members to collectively raise at least $100,000 for a woman candidate. Finally, we wanted to make history by making sure the first woman Democrat was elected to the Senate in her own right.

The work to turn all that into reality began at a meeting in my basement after the 1984 election. We spent nearly a year building an organization and developing a membership. And finally, in January 1986, it was time for EMILYs List to raise money for our candidates. At last, we'd see whether our ideas really worked.

The test case for our historic Senate first was Rep. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. She was nationally known and was leading the Democratic Senate primary field 21 in several early polls of the 1986 race. But she had not won the backing of the Democratic Party establishment. The failure of the state establishment to support women was exactly what had defeated Harriett Woods four years earlier.

The situation represented everything EMILYs List had been created to fight, and we stepped up. In just three weeks, we raised $23,916 for Mikulski. That was more than four times what an ordinary $5,000 contribution from political action committees would have been. Now, for the first time, we saw the power of early money working for a woman candidate, rather than against her.

On the night of the primary, Barbara won 307,876 votes, or 50%, in an eight-candidate field. We exceeded our goal of raising $100,000 for a female candidate, and Barbara won a smashing 21-point victory in November.

Today, what started with 25 people in my basement has grown to 3 million people. Overall, we have helped elect more than 100 Democratic women to the House, 19 to the Senate, 11 governors, and hundreds of state and local offices  and we are not done yet.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Today there are 20 women in the Senate (14 Democrats, six Republicans) and almost all were elected on their own. But the numbers, to me, arent the point. During the most recent government shutdown, women senators of both parties were the ones with strong working relationships, even friendships  and most important, the determination to get things done. Mikulski and Sen. Patty Murray on the Democratic side worked with Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Ayotte to put together the bipartisan deal that averted a disastrous default. Leadership, I must fully admit, was provided primarily from women in the Senate, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said after the agreement was announced.

When women were absent from the political stage, the first candidates were seen as mysterious creatures. Many voters, having no reference points, resorted to gender stereotypes. But who is cooking dinner? theyd ask. Or worse yet, Can you as a woman even understand a budget? Voters these days have seen women run effectively for office and serve with distinction. Each candidate has opened voters minds.

Now, former senator Hillary Clinton is a short step away from becoming the first woman presidential nominee of a major party. Her success, in part, is because scores of women before her stepped out of their comfort zones and dared to run.

Ellen R. Malcolm founded EMILYs List in 1985 and served as its president until 2010. This column is adapted from her new book, When Women Win: EMILYs List and the Rise of Women in American Politics, published March 8.

Sydney Alford applied to 10 colleges. She got into nine.

I never as a kid had a dream school, said Alford, who studied film at Biola University in La Mirada, Calif., and is now an assistant director in television. I was very undecided of what school to go to and got a lot of free application fees, so I figured why not throw out as many applications as I can?

Applying to several colleges is not uncommon these days. Students are both applying to and enrolling in more colleges than ever, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) which reported an increase of about 6.2 million students since fall 2000.

But even with a sharp increase in competition, should students go application crazy? The answer to that question seems more complicated than ever.

Whats the magic number?

As is the case with many should I questions, no black-and-white answer exists here. But some experts on college admissions have similar responses in regards to how many college applications students should submit.

Allen Grove, an admissions expert with the About.com College Admissions Guide, generally advises students apply to about six to eight colleges. That includes a couple of safety schools (schools youll no doubt get into), a couple of match schools (schools you meet the requirements for) and a couple of reach schools (schools that are less likely to accept you).

It all depends, Grove said. Students who want to get into more highly selective colleges are going to put out more applications than that. If some students know theyre a good match to a school, a handful is fine.

RELATED: What high school students should know about college applications

Even if you feel confident about getting into a school, it still makes sense to apply to more than one school. Grove has received several panic e-mails from overconfident students who didnt get into any school.

You want to make sure the student is being accurate in his or her self-assessment, Grove said. Ive seen students think theyre a sure thing for a school, when in fact theyre qualified but not a shoe-in.

This happened to Alford, who didnt get into her top choice, Pepperdine University, and didnt get the necessary funding to go to some of the other schools she got into. She was luckily able to re-negotiate funding at Biola last minute.

I kind of came up short, ironically, after applying to 10 schools, said Alford, who advises more decisive students to apply to four or five colleges.

Can you really apply to too many schools?

College applications can be time-consuming and pricey, costing as much as $100, unless you get the fees waived by the school or an organization. But even if cost doesnt bother you, there really is such thing as applying to too many schools, many experts argue.

In an article for The New York Times, Jordanna Suriani, an admissions counselor at Ramapo College of New Jersey, wrote students who apply to several colleges because theyre undecided are doing themselves a disfavor come April when its time to make a decision. Once you get that acceptance letter, you have even less time to make a choice.

Figure out what you need and want now, and apply to five or six schools, max, which offer you most, if not all of it, Suriani wrote. Forget about trying to get as many acceptances as possible to places that dont speak to you. Trust me. Come April, youll be glad you did.

Grove thinks its a little ridiculous when students apply to a dozen or more colleges. He cant imagine how the student did that many campus visits, in addition to extensive research, and decided that many schools were good matches.

You see students who apply to every single Ivy League, Grove said. I just have to wonder if the student who is going to like Columbia (in New York City) is really going to like Dartmouth (located in a town of around 11,000 people). I find that unlikely, so I often think students who are sending out that many applications havent done their research.

Narrowing down the choices

According to the most recent statistics by the NCES, there are more than 2,700 colleges to choose from in America. Consider the following things to help narrow down where to apply:

 Location

 Weather

 Rankings

 Proximity to home

 Cost

 Campus culture

 Majors offered

 Local internship and job offerings

If you seriously consider those factors, choosing fewer than 10 colleges to apply to should be much simpler.

When youre talking about what schools fit and whats a good match, you really have to know yourself, Grove said.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,George Martin helped bring Beatles revolution,"['Est March', 'Elysa Gardner', 'P M']","George Martin gave The Beatles their first recording contract. (Photo: Handout)

Since four lads from Liverpool changed the world more than 50 years ago, more than one man has claimed the title of ""fifth Beatle."" But for those whose opinions matter, there was only ever one candidate: George Martin, who died Tuesday at age 90. The elegant Englishman who produced so much of the groundbreaking band's catalog was as central in shaping the music and ensuring its endurance as any other person.

Paul McCartney said so himself of Martin, who gave The Beatles their first recording contract, in a detailed, moving statement that included a memory of the time McCartney brought a little song called Yesterday to a recording session. McCartney's bandmates  John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr  suggested he sing it alone, accompanying himself on guitar. Martin, a classically trained musician, had another idea: To use a string quartet.

""I said, Oh, no, George, we are a rock and roll band and I dont think its a good idea,'"" McCartney recalled. ""With the gentle bedside manner of a great producer, he said to me, 'Let us try it and if it doesnt work, we wont use it, and well go with your solo version.""

George Martin, producer of many of The Beatles' greatest hits, has died. He was 90-years-old. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more, including reaction from the band members. Buzz60

The rest is history, of course, as are Martin's countless contributions as The Beatles evolved from a pop phenom to a cultural force that redefined and transcended rock. He brought strings in again  a double quartet this time  for Eleanor Rigby. Over the band's relatively short but remarkably productive tenure, he encouraged the artists to experiment with different keys and tempos, as well as textures and pioneering techniques such as playing tapes backwards. His flourishes ranged from the baroque piano solo featured in In My Life (Martin was himself a pianist and oboist, and played on other Beatles tracks) to the marching band in Yellow Submarine to the trippy fadeout to All You Need Is Love, which draws from classical, folk and swing compositions.

While the older, refined Martin may not have shared The Beatles' interests in exploring the lifestyle associated with psychedelia, his genre-defying virtuosity and ingenuity helped make the group's defining adventures in the musical arena possible. He and engineer Geoff Emerick managed to combine two takes of Strawberry Fields Forever to produce the shimmering, hypnotic final track. Martin worked with McCartney to create the 16-minute medley that concludes Abbey Road, a rush of short songs that are alternately poignant, impish, frantic and ultimately exultant.

Producer George Martin, who worked with The Beatles throughout the group's career, has died at age 90. Here, he's seen in the studio with Paul McCartney (left), George Harrison and John Lennon in the early '60s. (Photo: EMI)

Martin had worked on classical, jazz and comedy recordings (including a Peter Sellers album), before joining forces with The Beatles, and he collaborated with many artists after the iconic group dissolved, including Jeff Beck, the Bee Gees and Celine Dion, who sang Here, There and Everywhere for the 1998 compilation tribute In My Life. Quincy Jones, another revolutionary producer and arranger, called Martin ""a true genius in body and soul"" in a statement, noting that Martin ""knew the secrets of our craft that so few know today.""

Jones added, ""Thank you for co-inventing the Beatles.""

Air Transport Services Group of Wilmington, Ohio, announced March 9, 2016 that it had signed an agreement to operate an air cargo network of 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft for Amazon Fulfillment Services in the United States. (Photo: USA Today)

SAN FRANCISCO  In a long-awaited and much-rumored move, Amazon is now officially going into the air freight business with the announcement that the Seattle online retailer has signed a five- to seven-year lease for 20 cargo planes.

As Amazon has grown, and especially as it has built out its lucrative Prime business, taking control of its logistics chain has been seen as key to cost cutting and on-time delivery.

""These planes provide critical capacity expansion to support the growth of Prime in the U.S. Planes provide an additional dedicated transportation method connecting Earths largest selection to customers from coast to coast. At our scale, supporting growth requires adding some of our own logistics capabilities,"" said spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman.

Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) of Wilmington, Ohio, announced Wednesday that it had signed an agreement to operate an air cargo network of 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft for Amazon Fulfillment Services in the United States.

Since last summer, we have been working closely with Amazon to demonstrate that a dedicated, fully customized air cargo network can be a strong supplement to existing transportation and distribution resources, Joe Hete, president and CEO of A

Air Transport Services Group planes on the ground in Wilmington, Ohio. The aircraft leasing and service company signed a deal with Amazon Fulfillment Services on March 9, 2016. (Photo: Air Transport Services Group)

TSG, said in a statement.

ATSG will lease 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to Amazon Fulfillment Services,, an affiliate of Amazon. The lease is for between five and seven years.

The Ohio company will also fly the aircraft and be responsible for gate and logistics services.

ATSG closed up 16.7% Wednesday at $13.73, on the news.

There have been rumors that Amazon planned to launch its own air freight-delivery service for months. The move will aid Amazon (AMZN) in its quest to control more of its logistics chain. It is part of what appears to be a broader plan by the company to build out its own delivery system worldwide.

""Amazon is tired of having its hands tied and relying on other carriers to move its massive amount of volume. As a result of this announcement, now Amazon is bringing more of its logistics in-house from supplier to fulfillment to delivery. Will we next see changes in how Amazon manages its final mile delivery?"" said John Haber, CEO of Spend Management Experts, an Atlanta-based supply-chain management consulting firm.

Amazon down slightly Wednesday, off 0.1% to $559.47.

The agreement also gives Amazon the right to buy up to 19.9% of the Ohio company over the next five years.

Fulfillment and Sortation

Amazon uses a variety of delivery services in the United States, including UPS, FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and its own direct delivery system. The ATSG planes will now be a part of that network.

""The planes will be used to transport customer packages from our fulfillment centers closer to customers for delivery, including for injection into our sortation center network,"" Cheeseman said.

Sortation centers take packages and sort them into very specific geographic groupings so they can be handed off to Amazon's last-mile delivery partners in close to ready-to-deliver order. Shipping prices go down for the online retailer the more of the sorting work it does upfront.

In some cases the ATSG planes may also take loads directly to Amazon's delivery partners.

For the most part, Amazon relies on other carriers to do final-mile delivery to customers' homes. However in the case of Prime Now, Amazon already delivers directly to customers in more than 25 metropolitan areas across the United States. That's also the case in some areas for AmazonFresh, an online grocery delivery service.

FedEx senior vice president for integrated marketing and communications Patrick Fitzgerald said the announcement was not a surprise to the shipper.

We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management. Amazon continues to be a valuable FedEx customer.

usatoday.com,2015-03-02 00:00:00,The 8 most expensive stocks you can buy,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Companies have now told us now much profit they brought. But the bigger question is how much investors are paying for those earnings.

When it comes to pricey big stocks  eight jump out as the most expensive you can buy. There are eight stocks in the Standard & Poors 500, including software maker Autodesk (ADSK), food processor ConAgra (CAG) and video streamer Netflix (NFLX), sporting P-E ratios of 100 or higher based on trailing adjusted earnings over the past 12 months, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. Capital IQ excludes extraordinary items in its calculation.

Heres a stat that shows just how pricey these stocks are. Investors are currently paying $17.89 for a claim to $1 in earnings reported by all the companies for 2014. But investors are paying $137 on average for a claim of these eight stocks adjusted 2014 profit.

So, why does P-E matter? Finding great companies is just half the battle of investing. The other half is finding ones that arent so expensive that theres still upside left. Theres nothing like a round number like Nasdaq 5000  which is getting closer every day to remind investors the importance of valuation. Despite these stocks huge valuations  their performance has been meh. The average gain of the eight stocks is 13% over the past year  just slightly below the 13.5% gain of the S&P 500.

When it comes to the most expensive big stock you can buy  food processor ConAgra comes to mind. The company behind such brands as popcorn king Orville Redenbacher and Swiss Miss is trading for 164 times earnings over the past 12 months. Thats an impressive valuation on a company where revenue grew just 13% in the year ended in November. To be fair, part of the high P-E is an accounting distortion. The company reported an adjusted diluted profit of 21 cents a share in the 12 months ended November, down 70% from its most recent fiscal year. The reason  ConAgra took a massive $217 million non-cash charge associated with a write-down of its private brands business, which isnt classified as unusual by S&P Capital IQ. Even so, analysts are shying away from this company with a sky-high P-E. Analysts rate the stock a hold, which really means sell on Wall Street. And the 18-month price target of $34.64 is 1% below where the stock is currently.

Sometimes, though, investors are willing to look past high P-Es. Expensive stocks can get even more expensive. At least thats what investors are betting on with computer design software maker Autodesk. The stock is the most expensive in all of the S&P 500  trading for 174 times diluted trailing earnings excluding charges. Even so, analysts still think this stock has 10% upside before hitting their 18-month price target of $70.94 a share. Earnings took a hit last year when operating expenses rose nearly 20%, while revenue added just 7%. Analysts are calling for flat growth in adjusted earnings per share this fiscal year, but see profit growth of 25% in fiscal 2017, says S&P Capital IQ.

None of the stocks are those generally considered by be the darling stocks among investors  except perhaps video streamer Netflix. The stock is trading for nearly 112 times its trailing earnings. The stock hasnt moved much the past year  gaining just 5%. But investors are hopeful the company can benefit from recent regulatory changes regarding Internet access  seen as being favorable.

P-Es are a handy guide  but theyre just a guide. Remember that if earnings jump  the P-E will fall all other things held the same. This shift can happen pretty quickly.

But right now  these are the companies investors are paying the prettiest pennies for.

usatoday.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Justices' junkets,"['Est March', 'The Editorial Board', 'P M']","Scalia's death at a Texas lodge spotlights a Supreme Court ethics question.

People pay respect to the late Justice Antonin Scalia at the Supreme Court on Feb. 19, 2016. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)

Last month's sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia at a Texas hunting lodge, where he was staying for free as a guest of a Texas businessman, put a spotlight on a long-simmering ethical issue.

Should Supreme Court justices be taking trips paid for by business people, political activists, ideological organizations, or anyone with vested interests in the broad legal issues that come before the court?

The short answer is no, they shouldn't.

But they are. From 2004 to 2014, the nine justices took more than 1,000 reported trips paid for by outside sources. Scalia was by far the most traveled, with more than 23 trips on average a year, followed by Justice Stephen Breyer, with 17. Chief Justice John Roberts took the least, fewer than five per year.

Were not suggesting that the justices are for sale. Or that they improperly discuss pending court cases. We are saying it looks bad for any judge, let alone the nine men and women who decide the most far-reaching issues of the day, to accept free trips, some of which are never publicly disclosed and many of which are paid for by private groups with clear agendas.

In today's hyperpartisan atmosphere, in which Senate Republicans say they won't consider anyone President Obama nominates to succeed Scalia, there is already a regrettable tendency to look upon the Supreme Court members as politicians in robes instead of impartial jurists. So even the appearance of a conflict of interest undermines confidence in the judicial system.

Its one thing for a justice to fly to another city for a night to speak at a university or a bar association event. Its quite another if the trip is to an expensive resort for an event paid for by someone such as billionaire Charles Koch, who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative political causes.

Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas spoke at separate Federalist Society events in the Palm Springs area sponsored by Koch. Their attendance  which inspired much criticism after it was accidentally revealed  might never have been public if not for Koch mentioning it on the invitation to a 2011 event.

Scalia also attended events sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society more than 20 times over about a decade in resort towns that include Park City, Utah, and Napa, Calif. Breyer traveled to London, Luxembourg and Sun Valley in 2014 with groups picking up the tab. And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared before the International Womens Health Coalition, which advocates for reproductive rights.

Under federal disclosure rules, the reporting of trips is late and scant, and sometimes it doesnt happen at all.

Like other government officials, the justices report once a year. It takes months for reports to become public. A trip taken in January 2015 wont be known publicly until this June. The value of transportation, lodging and meals is not disclosed, only the location and sponsor. And many trips fall into a gaping hole created by this exception: Personal hospitality of an individual does not need to be reported.

That might well have been the fate of Scalias trip to the Texas hunting lodge where he died. The businessman picked up the tab for 37 guests, including Scalia's $700-a-night room, according to The Washington Post. The host also owns a company that had a matter the Supreme Court declined to hear last year, The New York Times reported.

Judicial ethics prohibit taking a gift from someone with a matter pending before the court. But what about next year or the year after that? Not a problem.

The justices, Roberts has written, consult with the code of ethics that governs all other federal judges. But it doesnt actually cover members of the court. A measure introduced in Congress last year would require the justices to create a code of their own.

The justices, who earn nearly a quarter of a million a year, shouldn't need a code to recognize that they ought to pay their own way to certain events or stay away from pricey retreats labeled as educational events.

Four more bids were handed out on Tuesday night with Fairleigh Dickinson, Green Bay, South Dakota State and Gonzaga earning their spot in the field of 68. The debate on whether or not Gonzaga gets in can end now after the pivotal West Coast Conference final. But a new one begins regarding St. Mary's.

Unlike Wichita State and Monmouth, the Gaels were not aggressive with their non-conference scheduling. They played California and lost and faced Stanford and won. Other than that, there's no meat on the slate. The committee won't be impressed. Eighteen of their 31 games were against teams in the top 200, and this does not bode well.

One saving grace: Gonzaga topping them has moved the 'Zags into the top 50, so now there are four games against top-50 opponents on the resume. Their record (27-5 overall, 15-3 WCC) is what's impressive, but the committee should take a stance on their weak scheduling, which it hasn't done in the past. St. Mary's has bizarrely squeaked in several tournaments. This year could be the same. The criteria isn't there, though.

Projections as of 9 a.m. ET on March 9.

(Photo: Nick Ut, AP)

California regulators are considering whether to let Volkswagen owners keep driving their dirty diesels rather than force the automaker to buy the cars back and scrap them.

An enforcement official told a legislative hearing Tuesday that it doesn't appear that VW has a way to fully repair the automakers' diesel cars that are registered in the state, leaving open the possibility that only partially repaired cars might be allowed to continue to operate.

""Our goal has been to fix the vehicles and return them to their certified configuration as expeditiously as possible,"" Todd Sax, chief of the California Air Resources Board enforcement division, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""Unfortunately, this may not be possible.""

Volkswagen has admitted to rigging the emissions systems on up to 11 million vehicles worldwide to beat emissions tests. It inserted software into the cars that could detect when they were undergoing testing, and only then turned on all the pollution-control systems. On the road, the cars spew up to 40 times the allowed level of pollutants.

The air resources board estimates there are 65,000 to 70,000 VW Group cars with 2-liter four-cylinder engines and 16,000 with the 3-liter six-cylinder diesel. All are believed to have suspect ""defeat devices.""

The board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are the ones who discovered the deception last year and made it public. Now VW is the subject of numerous investigations and lawsuits, both in the U.S. and in Europe.

Mary Nichols, chair of California's Air Resources Board, said in November that VW may be required to buy back a large number of vehicles if they can't be modified to meet the requirements.

Sax, in speaking to legislators, said no final decision had been made.

NEW YORK - Federal lawyers Monday launched a new legal effort to compel Apple's assistance in gaining access to a New York City drug suspect's iPhone data.

Seeking to overturn a ruling against the government last week, the Department of Justice asked a Brooklyn federal court to approve a renewed application under the All Writs Act, the 18th century statute they said Apple complied with when they sought similar help from the company in dozens of similar past cases.

The renewed application echoed some of the arguments used by government lawyers as they battle Apple in an effort to gain similar access to the iPhone data of San Bernardino, Calif. terror attack shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.

Government investigators have been unable to get access to data on either of the iPhones because the devices are locked with a passcode. Efforts to bypass the phones' lock screens without Apple's help would risk destroying some or all of the data secured inside.

""This case in no way upends the balance between privacy and security,"" prosecutors wrote in a 46-page legal brief that challenged the rationale Magistrate Judge James Orenstein relied on for his Feb. 29 ruling that the All Writs Act did not properly apply to the government's request.

""The Constitution has already struck the relevant balance: it protects the people's privacy 'in their persons, houses papers and effects,' but permits reasonable searches including ones were the government has a warrant,"" prosecutors wrote. ""Here, the government has a warrant. And a longstanding federal statute provides this court with the authority to require Apple to assist with that warrant.""

Apple has said that it challenges court orders if there is any question about the legal legitimacy or scope of the government demand.

""Judge Orenstein ruled the FBIs request would 'thoroughly undermine fundamental principles of the Constitution and we agree,"" Apple said in a statement issued Monday night. ""We share the Judges concern that misuse of the All Writs Act would start us down a slippery slope that threatens everyones safety and privacy.""

In contrast with the Brooklyn case, a federal judge in California ordered Apple to comply with the legal request for help gaining access to data on Farook's iPhone. Apple last week filed an appeal of that ruling.

The Brooklyn federal court case focuses on Jun Feng, a Queens, N.Y. defendant who pleaded guilty in October to a methamphetamine conspiracy. Investigators sought access to his iPhone 5 as they continue to investigate other aspects of the alleged plot.

Apple has confirmed it can provide the assistance sought by the government, as it has done in the past, and has said ""doing so would pose no significant burden to the company,"" government lawyers wrote.

Their legal brief said the Brooklyn federal court retains ""supervision and control"" of the legal dispute delegated to Orenstein, who ranks below a U.S. District Court judge. As a result, they asked the court to weigh the resubmitted application as if it were a newly-filed legal matter.

On your cheat sheet, highlight these undervalued players who should be getting more love, but arent.

OF Justin Upton, Detroit Tigers

Four 26-plus-homer seasons in five years. Five with 18-plus steals in the last seven. Just 28 years old. Joins one of baseballs best lineups. Time to stop letting him slide on your board.

OF Carlos Gomez, Houston Astros

A first-rounder before 2015 with elite power and speed. Injuries and a bad Milwaukee team hurt his production. Houstons contending squad and great park should revive him.

DRAFT GUIDE: Rankings, more

1B Adrian Gonzalez, Los Angeles Dodgers

The softest landing spot in a treacherous middle-upper tier of first basemen. Mid- to high 20s in homers, 80-plus RBI in each of his 10 full seasons.

RP Zach Britton, Baltimore Orioles

Highest grounder percentage of any qualified reliever (79.1%). Best K/9 (10.8) in his career. Both thanks to lethal two-seamer/sinker. 73 saves over the last two years.

RP David Robertson, Chicago White Sox

Homers may bug him sometimes, but K/9 (12.0 career), control (1.85 last year) are elite. 73 saves over the last two years. Flukishly low left-on-base percentage (65.7) will correct itself and his ERA.

SS Brandon Crawford, San Francisco Giants

Sure, he wont be better than last year. But why is everyone writing off a virtual repeat of him finally paying off a natural growth path? He had the ninth-longest average homer and fly-ball distance among all major leaguers last year. Still think that power is a fluke?

3B Mike Moustakas, Kansas City Royals

Another 2015 breakout bat facing skepticism. His all-fields approach revolutionized his game. And he combined to smash 12 homers in August and September. 30 over a full year  the type of power scouts said he had in his prospect days  remains on the table.

C Matt Wieters, Baltimore Orioles

Even position players need time to recover from Tommy John surgery. Though recent obstacles hide it, remember: He hit 22 or 23 homers from 2011-2013 and still boasts his first-round pedigree. Yoooooge profit potential.

1B/OF Mark Trumbo, Baltimore Orioles

Hes had 30-homer seasons for Anaheim and mustered eight in 173 at-bats in Safeco Field last year. Now, hell enjoy residing in Camden Yards with a likely 30-bomb year and RBI/run boosts in this lineup.

FANTASY PREVIEW: Order now

OF Dexter Fowler, Chicago Cubs

Now that hes returned to the North Side, his ADP should climb back toward the top 150 players. If your competitors dont notice, snatch up his 20-20 potential. Hes one of the best candidates to lead the majors in runs scored.

SP Yordano Ventura, Kansas City Royals

Bad first half was corrected by his great second half. Ks, first-pitch strikes jumped after the break. Grounder rate on the year jumped. Great stuff, great park. If he  and you  can navigate around his on-and-off wildness, he could be another Francisco Liriano, if not a fantasy ace.

SP Julio Teheran, Atlanta Braves

Teheran doesnt have as much K upside as Ventura, but he also enjoyed a second-half rebound in velocity and whiffs. At 25, he has plenty more to show. Hes not 2014 good, but he can be 2013 good again (3.20 ERA, 8.24 K/9).

OF Gerardo Parra, Colorado Rockies

Corey Dickersons replacement had a mini-breakthrough (.291, 14 HR, 14 SB), but no one seems to care. That BA jump could stick thanks to Coors Field, which will aid his power, maybe toward 20 dingers.

OF Josh Reddick, Oakland Athletics

In another 20-homer season, he made strides with stolen bases, plate discipline and matchups against lefty hurlers. Hes three years removed from a 32-homer effort.

SP Mike Fiers, Houston Astros

Few late-rounders have as established a strikeout profile as the rightys (9.2 K/9 career as a starter). Homer problems and Minute Maid Park scare off fantasy drafters. For the price of a sixth mixed arm, they shouldnt.

SP Jason Hammel, Chicago Cubs

2014: 8.1 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, 3.47 ERA in 176 1/3 innings.

2015: 9.1 K/9, 2.1 BB/9, 3.74 ERA in 170 2/3 innings.

Are we really letting 27 ERA points make us forget about his believable breakout two seasons ago that was secretly backed up last year?

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Acquiring the NFL's 2014 rushing leader DeMarco Murray has cost Tennessee a new deal for the running back and a simple swap of fourth-round draft picks with the Philadelphia Eagles.

The Titans confirmed the trade Wednesday, and Murray will be introduced at a news conference Thursday.

Murray's agency announced a trade and a new contract had been reached Monday night, and what Tennessee had to give up to the Eagles had been unknown.

The Titans will drop 13 spots to No. 15 with the Eagles taking their pick at No. 2 in the fourth round.

General manager Jon Robinson says Murray is a premium back and that he has admired the two-time Pro Bowler and 2014 NFL Offensive Player of the Year from afar for a long time.

Meet Flipagram, where some 5 billion photos and videos are being shared monthly. Jefferson Graham visits the L.A. Flipagram headquarters to find out what's behind all those ""Flips.""

Flipagram is the red-hot app for creating music videos from smartphone photos. It's available for Apple, Android and Windows platforms. (Photo: Flipagram)

LOS ANGELES  Shes on Vine, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. But the social app of choice for classically-trained pop singer Emm is Flipagram.

I just passed 100,000 fans, on Flipagram, which marries smartphone videos and photos with popular music. Yeah!

Some 40 million folks monthly (from from around 10 million a year ago) visit the Instagram-meets-YouTube free app to repackage their smartphone photos and videos with popular music, everything from the latest Justin Bieber hit to a classic from Frank Sinatra. Photo/video sharing growth rate of 300% year-over-year has lured in big investors like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins.

Five billion photos and videos are shared monthly on the app  a rate that's getting closer to the 8 billion videos viewed every day each on both Snapchat and Facebook.

Some of the Los Angeles-based start-ups enthusiasts are emerging artists like Emm, who use it to showcase their music to new fans. She found a manager and club dates just by posting videos with her music to the app.

Others just want to share their photos in a form that's different from Instagram collage. The 3-year-old company, co-founded by serial entrepreneur Farhad Mohit, is offering a visual-first culture a new way to share their products  music.

People, especially younger millennials, take so many pictures during the day, he says. They speak and communicate daily with pictures.

Beyond upand coming talent, big-name celebrities like Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Channing Tatum and Madonna have discovered the app, and have posted their own photo/video music slideshows.

And the app has blue-chip financing behind it: $70 million from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and Index Ventures, in the latest financing round, announced in 2015.

The company won't comment on valuation, but TechCrunch recently estimated it at over $300 million.

Theres a reason celebrities have found it (Flipagram), Michael Moritz, the chairman of Sequoia, told USA TODAY. It answers a need for them that they cant get on Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, a way to weave in stills and videos simply with music.

Flipagram is the red-hot app for marrying photos and videos with music, to the tune of 5 billion shared images monthly. (Photo: Flipagram)

Moritz is a long-time investor in such companies as Google, Yahoo and PayPal. He serves on the Flipagram board of directors with Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr.

While the app is free, Flipagram brings in money by selling the right to remove the Flipagram watermark for $1.99 a pop.

The company's main focus is on user growth. But its competing in a crowded arena.

Flipagram logo (Photo: Flipagram)

There are dozens of apps to make music videos from photos and videos, (like musical.ly and Vidify), and apps to either collect or share photos. Facebook's Moments app bunches Camera Roll photos and videos together, for instance. And Facebooks Instagram is the No. 1 photo sharing app, with 400 million monthly users and 40 billion photos shared to date.

Flipagram distinguishes itself in two ways -- length of social video and its music library.

Flipagram co-founder Farhad Mohit at Flipagram headquarters in Los Angeles (Photo: Jefferson Graham)

Similar social products are much shorter: Vines are only 6 seconds long and Instagram videos 15 seconds, but Flipagram lets folks go as long as 60 seconds.

And Facebook, Instagram, and Vine don't have tools to merge pictures and videos with licensed music, like Flipagram does.

That's a key part of Flipagram's recent success, says Mohit.

RECORD DEALS

Two years after Mohit, 47, started Flipagram, he made deals with the major record labels to allow usage of current and library songs to be featured legally in Flipagram videos. It took 14 months to conclude the deals.

Flipagram had offered song snippets via iTunes, but ""we weren't licensed for it,"" Mohit says. ""That put a huge liability over the company. It was like a big sword over our head.""

Having the music and story-telling tools is Flipagram's big differentiator, says Mohit.

Pulling photos and videos from your smartphone into a story with a beginning, middle and end--and music, ""is an overwhelming thing,"" he says. ""It's like the first time I tried Instagram. I felt like I was an artist when In put a filter on the photo."" His tools ""make you feel like a story teller, like your story matters.""

Flipagram co-founder Farhad Mohit, photographed at Flipagram headquarters in Los Angeles (Photo: Jefferson Graham)

Before Flipagram, Mohit, an Iranian born immigrant who came to the U.S. as a small child, started two business rating online sites, Shopzilla and Bizrate, which he sold to Scripps Howard for $525 million.

Mohit went out of his way not to have the company based in trendy Silicon Beach, where YouTube, Snapchat and others have offices. Instead he housed the 50-person company in the heart of mid-LA, Century City, home to high-powered law firms and powerhouse talent firm Creative Artists Agency.

Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, is a fan of the app. It really simplifies the whole idea of stringing media together to make your own personal stories, he says.

When on a trip, you dont take one photo of Paris, but many, says Mohit. You talk about ...the whole trip. All that can be strung together in a Flipagram, and it tells the whole story.

Bajarin sees Flipagram as a ripe takeover target for companies that want to get into the storytelling business, mentioning companies like Apple and Google.

Mohit says the company isnt for sale. For the future, Mohit is looking to add a feature to the app, coming later this year, that will let users take photos and videos directly within the app, instead of having to use the native camera app on phones.

And hes excited about his market. Theres 5.2 billion phones out there, he reminds me.

LONDON  Britains top court on Wednesday ruled against Deutsche Bank and UBS in a long-running case over taxes on bonuses that has opened the door to back taxes by the banks and which could ding other companies that have engaged in similar schemes.

The German and Swiss banks set up bonus pools that relied on offshore vehicles to reduce taxes on bonuses awarded during the 2003 to 2004 tax season. The offshore vehicles were set up explicitly for the purpose of reducing employees' taxes on bonuses and often later wound down, according to the court.

The UK Supreme Court on Wednesday blasted the efforts as ""sophisticated attempts of the Houdini taxpayer to escape from the manacles of tax.""

""Shares awarded to bank employees as bonuses are liable to tax,"" the court tweeted following the ruling Wednesday.

The banks had argued that the bonus schemes, which have not been repeated, didn't break rules in part because conditions were attached to the bonuses that made more like restricted securities. But the court Wednesday called some of the restrictions ""arbitrary.""

We note todays decision and can confirm that all tax and national insurance due as a result have already been paid, said Alison Moody, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank. The bank paid taxes on the bonuses after it lost the first case. Wednesday's decision was just the latest appeal in the on-going dispute between the banks and the U.K. government.

UBS did not immediately return a request for comment.

WASHINGTON  Airlines are projecting a record spring travel season, the trade group Airlines for America said Wednesday

The group forecast 140 million passengers during March and April, a 3% rise compared to the same period a year ago. That total would be the highest ever for spring travel, topping the 136.2 million passengers who flew during March and April of 2015, the group said.

The continued growth in passenger volumes can be attributed to the accessibility and affordability of air travel today, said John Heimlich, the groups chief economist. To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes.

Ten publicly traded airlines reported a combined $23.2 billion in pre-tax earnings during 2015, which led to complaints about fares not dropping along with fuel prices.

But fares are generally lower during the last decade when factoring in inflation. Airlines invested $17 billion on improvements such as new aircraft, in-flight entertainment and ground equipment, Heimlich said.

""They are reinvesting improving cash flows to benefit customers, employees and investors,"" Heimlich said. ""With more reliable operations, lower airfares, more seats in the marketplace and a steady stream of new and larger aircraft, airlines are seeing a record number travelers,exceeding 790 million last year.""

The estimated spring increase of 63,000 passengers per day is comparable to what the Transportation Security Administration projected for spring break.

Sharon Pinkerton, senior vice president for legislative and regulatory policy at Airlines for America, urged TSA to reduce wait-times in the short term through better staffing assignments during peak travel times and additional canine teams.

""We need to make sure theyre going to the right spaces,"" Pinkerton said. ""We urge TSA to focus on short-term wins to try to make sure that we keep those wait-times reasonable.""

Who is eligible to participate in The Collegiate Readership Program?

College and university administrators and students may offer The Collegiate Readership Program to all of their students on campus.

What are some benefits of The Collegiate Readership Program?

By providing college and university students with daily access to newspapers, The Collegiate Readership Program will inform and educate students about community, national

and world events. The program will also contribute to the students habit of reading

newspapers on a regular basis.

How do students obtain their newspapers each day?

Newspapers are delivered to conveniently-located displays in the lobbies of residence halls and other campus locations each weekday morning (depending upon each college or universitys location). Students may then pick up their desired newspaper(s) throughout the day. As fresh newspapers are delivered each morning, all unused newspapers remaining in the displays from the previous day are picked up for recycling.

How many newspapers can we offer to our students on a daily basis?

Traditionally, one to three newspapers are offered with The Collegiate Readership Program. USA TODAY, a local or community paper and a regional paper are a successful combination. However, USA TODAY allows each school to decide which newspapers will best suit their campus and will work with every school to design a program right for them.

Are newspapers delivered to residence halls and other campus locations on holidays and over student breaks?

USA TODAY will only deliver newspapers on days designated by the college or university.

What other newspapers participate in The Collegiate Readership Program?

USA TODAY has partnered with many newspapers across the country for The Collegiate Readership Program. Some examples are: The Centre Daily Times, The Dallas Morning News, the Houston Chronicle, The Sacramento Bee, the Cincinnati Enquirer, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post and The New York Times.

What other colleges or universities are participating in The Collegiate Readership Program?

USA TODAY has been involved in a partnership with Penn State since the fall of 1997. In fall of 1999, The Ohio State University, Miami University, George Washington

University and Rochester Institute of Technology began the program.

What if we would like to test the program at our college or university?

USA TODAY can work with the institution on what makes sense in terms of testing a program on campus, and assessing the program.

Can you estimate the cost of a full Collegiate Readership Program (delivering newspapers to all on-campus locations)?

The cost of a paid Collegiate Readership Program will vary. This figure is based upon anticipated newspaper usage. USA TODAY can estimate the cost for you, and offers an education discount rate for participating schools.",[]

The spiritual soul searching within this group is as heated as the political argument that's fragmenting the Republican Party. Some evangelicals are deriding Christians who support Trump by challenging their commitment to biblical principles and even questioning their Christianity.

The examples are numerous. Rafael Cruz, a pastor and Ted Cruzs father, asks if Trump evangelicals are really sticking to the word of God. Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, suggests evangelicals who support Trump may well be drunk right now, and havent been into a church since someone invited them to Vacation Bible School sometime back when Seinfeld was in first-run episodes. Ouch.

Conservative Christian Radio talk show host Steve Deace meanwhile alleges that evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress is watering down/distorting the Gospel in full public view on behalf of a politician. And the Christian Post for the first time in its history took a stand against a political candidate, writing that Christians need to pray for personal repentance, divine forgiveness and spiritual awakening for our nation. It is not the time for Donald Trump.

The condemnation of Trumps Christian supporters from within evangelical circles is troubling. Is there now a threshold of Christianity that you need to achieve to be a real evangelical? In other words, if you support Cruz youre a true believer but if you go with Trump youre not? Are Trump Christians going to have to wear a political Scarlet Letter? And if were going to go down that road, where exactly do we draw the line on morality? What about John McCain in 2008? Should evangelicals have spurned him because he had an affair with his first wife? What about Ronald Reagan? He was divorced and his wife celebrated astrology.

Many evangelicals who support Trump have decided to put presidential leadership and pastoral leadership in two distinct boxes. Does that make them less Christian? Or are they, like other GOP primary voters, simply at wits end? Plumbers (politicians) have been called in for decades to fix the toilet (the federal government) but it keeps leaking. Now large numbers of voters want to bring in someone outside the plumbing industry with a track record of success in areas unrelated to plumbing. Will it work? Nobody has any earthly idea. But sometimes you have to take a chance, and some evangelicals clearly are ready to give that chance to Trump.

If establishment GOP leaders want to blame anyone for Trumps rise, they should start with a good look in the mirror. They let this happen. They waited too long to go after him. Furthermore, they took evangelical voters for granted. They felt confident that evangelicals would blindly vote for a traditional-values candidate. What they underestimated was that evangelicals are hungry for leadership, a fighter, and an outsider whos brash and bold enough to say or do anything to get America back on track.

Ted Cruz wants to be that guy but, while hes running as an outsider, he sounds like an insider. He sounds like hes about to trot out the line, Four score and seven years ago, complete with an echo voice machine, every time hes onstage. Plus, hes suffered among evangelicals ever since a dirty tricks political narrative began to take hold after his win in Iowa. If youre running as the evangelical candidate, you cant afford that storyline.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

That was clear on Super Tuesday, when Trump cleaned Cruzs clock among evangelicals in the Deep South states of Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. Its worth noting that former pastor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee won those same four Southern states on Super Tuesday back in 2008. In his book God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy, Huckabee talks about a large segment of faith-based voters that is concerned about the decline of patriotism, and the disconnect between rural America and the powerful, corporate world. Theres an important lesson here. Huckabee and Trump both preach a pro-America, anti-elitist message that plays well in the Deep South with evangelicals. It doesnt matter if youre a pastor like Huckabee or a billionaire like Trump because in both cases, the candidates made the all-important emotional connection.

A closer look at the Super Tuesday numbers reveals Trump is solidly winning white evangelical Protestants who make $75,000 or less and have at least some college education. In other words, hes appealing most to blue-collar evangelicals who love America, love God and also love a candidate who throws haymakers at political bigwigs.

Republican establishment leaders, part of that bigwig contingent, convinced themselves that the Summer of Trump was a fling and that a flameout was a day away. Instead, the next Summer of Trump they experience is likely to be watching him accept their partys nomination for president.

Wall Streets eyes will be on Frankfurt on Thursday. The reason: the European Central Bank is meeting, and Wall Street is hoping it delivers on its promises to inject fresh stimulus into the ailing eurozone economy and spark a much-needed rise in dangerously low inflation.

The ECB is widely expected to announce additional easing Thursday morning as inflation fell back into negative territory in February, Mary Catherine Sinclair of Strategas Research Partners told clients in a report.

The ECB disappointed investors at its last meeting, when it didnt deliver quite the dose of stimulus Wall Street was hoping for.

The Mario Draghi-led ECB is fighting a war with deflationary forces. To combat that financial scourge, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates for deposits  currently at -0.3%  even further into negative territory. The ECB is also expected to extend and expand its bond-buying program.

Wall Street is forecasting an additional 0.1% cut in the deposit rate, as well as boosting its monthly bond-buying program by another 10 billion euros to bring it to 70 billion euros a month. Some on Wall Street say the ECB might  and could  do more.

While Decembers under-deliverance highlights the risk of another disappointment, the deteriorating economic outlook should persuade the ECB to be bolder this time, Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics wrote in a note.

usatoday.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,Festive floating bars in the Caribbean,"['Est March', 'Mark Rogers', 'Special For Usa Today', 'A M']","When it comes to the Caribbean, theres almost as much variety between floating bars as there is among bars in a large city. Some floating bars will slide a bottled beer in front of the customer and offer up a paper plate of grilled food, while others will go the elegant route, with signature cocktails and expertly prepared cuisine. Some bars are offshore, and can only be reached by boat, while others are on piers and jetties, surrounded on three sides by the Caribbean Sea, or are ships that set off from shore every day, ready to deliver a bistro-on-the-briny good time.

Floyds Pelican Bar  Jamaica

Floyds Pelican Bar on the south coast of Jamaica can lay claim to being the most intriguing and colorful floating bar in the Caribbean. From the shore, it looks like a tangle of flotsam and jetsam resembling the nest of a giant sea bird. Get up closer and youll catch a hint of movement and the glint of a Red Stripe bottle between rustic walls. The Pelican Bar sits on a sand bar about a quarter mile from shore, and is reached via boat. Passage can be arranged at the beachside hotel, Jakes, or by approaching boat owners on nearby Treasure Beach. Back in 2001, the bar was built by local fisherman Floyd Forbes. The image of a floating bar on stilts came to Floyd in a dream and with hard work and help from his fishing buddies, the Pelican Bar became a reality. Today its an amazingly serene spot to sit back with a brew or a rum punch, and enjoy a swim while Floyd fries up the catch of the day.

The Willy T  British Virgin Islands

The British Virgin Islands are noted for their Caribbean-inflected reserve. But every buttoned-down destination needs its escape valve, and in the BVI, its the William Thornton Floating Bar & Restaurant, affectionately known as the Willy T. The bar is docked in the waters of the southwest corner of The Bight, an anchorage found off the shores of Norman Island. The Willy T has been pouring drinks and serving meals since 1989. The first craft was a wooden Baltic trading vessel built in 1935, which sprang a leak and sank in 1995. The Willy T was subsequently reborn as a steel-hulled, 100 foot ship. Things can get raunchy aboard, and blue noses would probably find themselves paddling for shore in a hurry. In times gone by, women who dared to jump naked from the ship were given a William Thornton T-shirt. While the practice of jumping is officially forbidden, when Willy T shotskis prevail -- shotskis are a ski with four shot glasses glued to it, with four drinkers downing high proof alcohol at the same time -- anything can happen.

Pinchos - Aruba

Pinchos takes the floating bar concept beyond the white bar towel to white glove service and cuisine. Pinchos sits on a pier, suspended over the water, with the sea practically close enough to touch. This is chic seaside dining, complete with candlelight, tropical cocktails, and a grill menu offering unexpected fare, such as Pickled Cucumber and White Grape Salad, Seared Ahi Tuna, and Black Angus Filet Mignon with a Truffle Butter Sauce. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, theres live music.

D-Boat - Antigua

Getting tanked takes on a whole new meaning aboard D-Boat, a former oil tanker docked at Antiguas Shell Beach Marina. The ship has been scraped and repainted until its a gleaming entertainment machine that can deliver thrills for the whole family. In addition to having an open bar, D-Boat is something of a floating water park, with slides, rope swings, trampolines, and options for an off-boat snorkel. Day excursions can also include visits to Stingray Park, where passengers can get into the water to interact with live stingrays. For a real party-hearty atmosphere, check to see if D-Boat is having one of its full moon parties during your time on island, when the D-Boat transforms into a hip nightclub on the sea.

La Balandra  Bonaire

La Balandra is a floating bar that has a tenuous hold on shore, since its actually on a jetty that thrusts out on the sea. The floating bar aspect is accentuated by La Balandras design, which mimics a Spanish ship. Its a good choice for those in search of a bit of elegance, since the setting is sophisticated, with an emphasis on dock-to-dish cuisine utilizing fresh-caught seafood. In fact, the chef usually picks and chooses from fishing boats pulling up beside La Balandra displaying the days catch, which might include everything from rainbow runners to lion fish. Breakfast is also served at La Balandra, and nocturnal bar flies may find it the perfect place to recoup after the excesses of the previous evening.

Artist rendering of the Supreme Court in 2015. (Photo: Dana Verkouteren, AP)

Congress can change the Ethics in Government Act  a complex statute with more than 30 pages of small type  and require Supreme Court justices to report the value of lodging over some set amount.

Some people would go further and prohibit justices from accepting lodging or other benefits from any ideological individual or organization, even if they have no cases before the court. That goes too far. After all, what is ideology? In practice, those who disagree with us are ideological and those who agree are not.

When a university invites a justice to give a lecture, it pays expenses and a fee. Are universities ideological? You bet they are. They frequently litigate over such issues as sexual harassment, procedural due process, free speech, minimum wages for graduate students and athletes, gender-neutral bathrooms, health care mandates and intellectual property.

The American Bar Association (ABA), which often invites justices to its meetings, is hardly non-ideological. It supports a host of issues typically considered liberal. It files briefs in a plethora of cases.

A frequent target of those who oppose judges attending ideological meetings is the Federalist Society, which, unlike the ABA, does not lobby for legislation, take policy positions or endorse judicial nominees. The Federalist Society describes itself as a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in law.

Its liberal counterpart, the American Constitution Society, also hosts judges and immodestly says its a powerful institution helping to shape the law. Its underwriters include major corporations, such as Microsoft and Google, that routinely litigate before the court.

George Mason Universitys Law & Economics Center offers programs with prominent speakers that have included Nobel laureates. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote of her enduring appreciation for the seminars that she attended for advancing both learning and collegial relationships among federal judges.

Ample disclosure is a good thing, but cloistering judges from the world they live in is bad and impossible.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at Macomb Community College Sports & Expo Center Field house in Warrren, Mich., on March 4, 2016. (Photo: Jeff Kowalsky, European Pressphoto Agency)

WASHINGTON  Foreign politicians are responding to Donald Trump's unvarnished world views with equally undiplomatic candor.

Three detractors  all current or former Mexican leaders  compared him to Adolf Hitler. Russian President Vladimir Putin and far right-wing politicians in Europe have praised the Republican presidential front-runner for his blunt style, forceful personality and anti-immigration views.

Such reactions from world leaders is unprecedented, said historian James Thurber, who studies U.S. presidents at American University in Washington.

I cannot recall a time when anyone spoke out during the presidential election, and especially in the primary election, Thurber said. This has to do with outrageous statements (Trump's) made relevant to the war in Syria, Muslims, Spanish-speaking countries, immigrants and trade. ... He's really alienated a lot of people.""

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto delivered one of the harshest rebukes Monday, telling the Excelsior newspaper that Trump's ""strident tone"" is reminiscent of dictators Benito Mussolini and Hitler, populists who rode a tide of economic discontent to power.

""There have been episodes in the history of humanity, unfortunately, where these expressions, this strident rhetoric has only really been (a) very fateful stage in the history of mankind,"" he said.

Pena and other Mexican politicians are furious over Trump's vow to build a wall to keep Mexican migrants out of the United States  and make Mexico pay for it.

""I'm not going to pay for that (expletive) wall,"" former Mexican president Vicente Fox told Fusion's Jorge Ramos last month. Fox and another former president, Felipe Calderone, also compared Trump to Hitler.

Clearly, the possibility of a Trump presidency has provoked ""a feeling of desperation"" in Mexico, said Bill Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

It's not just Mexico worried about the prospect of a Trump presidency, said Richardson, former governor of New Mexico and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Trump's promise to Make America Great Again represents an isolationist policy that reflects the frustration of many American voters, but it is a viewpoint that worries world leaders, Richardson told USA TODAY.

The world laments that because, despite our faults, the world wants us to lead,"" Richardson said.

Negative reactions to Trump have also come from some of the United States' most stalwart allies, including Canada, Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Photos: Trump through the years

The unpredictable and candid things Trump says drive his popularity with voters but concern foreign leaders, who want to know where the United States stands on issues that affect them, Thurber said.

Also, 65% of Canadians said they feared a Trump presidency, according to a February survey by Canadian polling firm Leger.

Thurber said he thinks Trump will moderate his positions if he gets into office, but its going to be difficult to work with leaders whove openly criticized him. ""Still, were the United States of America, the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world so theyll have to deal with him.

Presidential historian Jeffrey Tulis at the University of Texas said some world leaders expressed concern about Ronald Reagan's competence when he ran against President Carter in 1980. But the criticism was not as withering as that directed at Trump.

World leaders are coming to grips with the possibility of a president who sounds like ""an autocrat from a tinpot country,"" Tulis said.

Whether for or against Trump, world leaders should butt out of American politics, said Danielle Pletka, a Republican and foreign policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.

Its none of their bloody business, said Pletka, who rejects Trump's worldview. This is our election, not theirs.

Among the critics:

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

On Sunday, he criticized Trump's approach toward immigrants and refugees. Ultimately being open and respectful towards each other is a much more powerful way to diffuse hatred and anger than ... big walls and oppressive policies, Trudeau said on CBS' 60 Minutes.

A day later, Trudeau softened his tone. ""I'm not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now,"" he told the Huffington Post. ""I'm not gonna support him either, obviously. But I am watching very, very carefully to see this, I think, important moment in the United States, in the greatest democracy in the world,"" Trudeau said.

German Vice Chancellor Sigma Gabriel

In Europe, which is coping with a migrant crisis, Gabriel said Trump and ""all these right-wing populists are not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development."" Gabriel lashed out in an interview with German publication Welt am Sonntag on Sunday.

British Prime Minister David Cameron

In December, Cameron said Trump's remarks calling for a temporary ban on Muslims to the U.S. are ""divisive, stupid and wrong."" Some members of the British Parliament want to bar Trump from visiting their country.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud

In the Middle East, the Saudi prince said Trump should withdraw from the U.S. race.

.@realDonaldTrump

You are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.



Withdraw from the U.S presidential race as you will never win.     (@Alwaleed_Talal) December 11, 2015

The pair got into a social media war in late January after Trump tweeted a photoshopped image of Fox News host Megyn Kelly standing next to the Saudi prince and claimed erroneously that the prince is co-owner of Fox News.

Trump:You base your statements on photoshopped pics?I bailed you out twice;a 3rd time,maybe?https://t.co/Raco0mvusphttps://t.co/jStBl7Ghia     (@Alwaleed_Talal) January 28, 2016

The Saudi prince, who is a minority investor in Fox News' parent company, complained about the image, pointing out that in the 1990s he helped bail Trump out of financial difficulties.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

Trump also had a run-in with the Israeli prime minister. The candidate called off a planned visit to Israel to meet Netanyahu after the Israeli leader criticized Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration to the United States.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects Donald Trump's recent remarks about Muslims.  PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 9, 2015

At the same time, Israel is fighting against militant Islam that targets Muslims, Christians and Jews alike and threatens the entire world.  PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 9, 2015

Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa

Ecuador's leftist president jabbed Trump, saying he would enjoy a Trump presidency because ""it would be very bad for the United States.""

His discourse is so dumb, so basic, that it would ... help socialist politicians in Latin America, Correa told the Ecuadorian newspaper El Dia.

Trump's admirers include:

Russian President Vladimir Putin

Putin, among the few to praise Trump, called the American business mogul ""an outstanding and talented personality.""

Jean-Marie Le Pen of France

The former leader of France's far-right, anti-immigration party, the National Front, tweeted: ""If I were American, I would vote Donald Trump.""

Si jetais americain, je voterais Donald TRUMP... Mais que Dieu le protege !  Jean-Marie Le Pen (@lepenjm) February 27, 2016

Lets take a trip around the NBA to see whos banged up right now.

On the mend

Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin stated hes very close to returning from his broken hand, though theres no firm timetable.

Out of action for nearly a month due to a knee injury, Chicago Bulls guard Jimmy Butler returned on Saturday.

The Philadelphia 76ers frontcourt was short-handed this past week: Center Nerlens Noel missed the past two games with a bum knee, and forward Jahlil Okafor has been out the last four with a shin injury. While forward Jerami Grant is seeing considerable burn in their absence, his production has been modest.

San Antonio Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge was scratched Saturday due to a migraine. Teammate Manu Ginobili, sidelined since undergoing testicular surgery in early February, made his return in the same game.

While the Miami Heat remain quiet on the subject, they confirmed forward Chris Bosh has been working out with the coaching staff. He remains out indefinitely.

Denver Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari, out with an ankle injury, may be shut down for the rest of the season. Guard D.J. Augustin continues to play significant minutes in Gallinaris absence.

New York Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis missed Saturdays game with a leg injury, but its believed to not be serious.

Injury-prone New Orleans Hornets guard Eric Gordon lasted four games before re-fracturing a finger on his shooting hand. Hes likely done for the year, again.

Gordons injury pushes guard Norris Cole back into the fringes of fantasy relevance, though Cole is day-to-day with back trouble.

Milwaukee Bucks guard Michael Carter-Williams has missed the last four games with knee tendinitis. Guard Jerryd Bayless could offer deep-league value until MCW returns.

Back in the starting lineup after a 10-game stint off the bench, Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal sustained a sprained pelvis Saturday night and is day-to-day.

Orlando Magic guard Victor Oladipo was out Friday due to a back contusion. Hes expected to return Monday.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,I am turning off the TV: Tell me when the Trump circus has left town,"['Est March', 'A M', 'Bruce Kluger']","The Donald has lowered the Republican primary to his crass, tabloid brand of politics.

Donald Trump campaigns in Orlando on March 5, 2016. (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images)

Im done with the 2016 election. Donald Trump has already won.

Like millions across America, I have spent the last nine months steeped in varying degrees of denial over what has become the most disturbing presidential sweepstakes in modern history. When Donald Trump first announced his candidacy last June, I barely shrugged, recalling an observation I saw a talking head make in 2011, when the hair-challenged narcissist-mogul flirted with a similar run for the White House.

This is what Donald Trump does every election cycle, the pundit commented. He brings attention to himself and his brand for a few months, then once hes seen his name in the media enough, he calls it quits.

Yeah, right. Only this time, he didnt quit.

And so with each passing week of this self-serving, farcical, downright mortifying mockery of our elective process, I have become increasingly convinced that Trump has pulled off something of a miracle. Rather than adjust his crass tabloid persona to fit the more elevated forum of presidential politics, he has managed to bring the whole blooming process down to his demolition-derby level.

For me, the final straw in this bizarre carnival was the torrent of post-debate headlines on Friday morning that talked about Donald Trumps penis (I cant believe I just typed those words). This is what happens when your nation laps at the trough of reality TV for too long. After a while, the conversation belongs to the lowest common denominator.

Welcome to the United States of Dumb.

I am quick to add that I dont credit Trump with any sort of genius in having pulled this thing off. To the contrary, his strategy has been both opportunistic and craven; and hes been aided in no small part by politicos on both sides of the aisle, who have happily accepted his campaign contributions in the past, lending him a false air of credibility.

Still, the exit polls arent lying when they talk about the nations anger  theres plenty to be mad about. But rather than address the true cause of that fury (a decline of the middle class, fueled by shocking economic disparity; a bitterly deadlocked Congress, led by ideology rather than reason), Donald Trump has taken a much less nuanced tack: by vilifying anyone who doesnt wear one of his signature Trump baseball caps  from the president to the pope  while summarily dismissing all those who dont share his views with the same smug nonchalance with which he fired contestants on The Apprentice.

And his fans are eating it up.

Perhaps the saddest moment of the past few weeks occurred not on the stump, but in CNN studios, during the now famous debate between former Obama official Van Jones and former Reagan aide Jeffrey Lord. I have a kid, seven years old, a clearly rattled Jones told Lord. I used to tell him, I dont want you watching The Kardashians; I want you watching the news so you can learn something. ... Well, now we have him watching Nick Jr.  he cant even learn civics!  because (theres so much vitriol coming out of) the circus wing of your party.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Jones isnt just speaking as a Democrat dad. Goodness and decency are bipartisan, and I would imagine that even the well-intentioned supporters of the man who would make America great again would be embarrassed to expose their kids to the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel discourse thats now playing in dens across the country.

And thats the greatest irony of this whole mess. Candidates running for high office  particularly the presidency  frequently invoke our nations children as those who stand to gain or lose the most when voters head to the polls in November. But in some perverse plot twist in the great American story, elected officials are fast becoming the last place we should look to provide hope for our kids. The language is too coarse, the tactics are vile and any sense of humanity is nowhere to be found.

Think about it. In this debate season alone, weve heard a ton from GOP candidates about cancelling education programs, scrapping Obamacare's family plans and deporting kids whose parents are here illegally  but precious little about what we can do to lift our children up. Every day, an estimated 160,000 kids stay home from school for fear of being bullied, and 4,600 a year commit suicide. Why isnt that being discussed at these debates?

Because the process has gone to hell, and the real bully  the leading Republican candidate for the presidency of the United States  doesnt have the time to look into the hearts of his fellow citizens because hes too busy looking in his pants.

So Ill be turning off the TV now, thank you. Somebody call me in November and tell me how it all ended.

Letters to the editor:

In a rare moment of solidarity, I stand with Mitt Romney (Romney blasts Trump as a fraud Clinton would beat).

After great thought, I would like to respectfully announce my departure from the Republican Party. I cannot see any future for this party with Donald Trump as the potential leader. Im aghast that the Republican leadership hasnt done something about this elephant in the room who is bringing down the tenets of the party with crude and unthinking behaviors. Romney is spot on with his assessment of the Trump vs. Clinton election.

The Hillary Clinton campaign must relish every moment Trump opens his mouth. His ideas, while energetic, are impractical and foolish. The things he wants to accomplish appeal to the people, but he has no clear vision of how to get things done.

Hes a puppet saying exactly what people want to hear, but should he actually win, very little of his rhetoric will come to fruition.

Debby James; Mission Viejo, Calif.

Its clear that the Republican insiders do not understand what is happening in America with the unprecedented success of Trump. Someone called it a quiet revolution, and I agree.

In my personal opinion, politicians need only to look in the mirror to see why the American public is so incredibly outraged. Generous health care and retirement programs, vacations disguised as fact-finding trips and a torrent of lobbyist and special interest money are dumped on them regularly. In exchange for living like kings and queens on our dime, we get gridlock, stalling, waffling, inaction and long recesses.

Guess what, Washington! The people finally recognize that the king has no clothes and its payback time.

Oh, and lets not forget term limits that hopefully are coming down the road.

Ted Cruz 1, John Kasich 2, Marco Rubio 3 and Donald Trump last.

 @trialattorney12

Kasich. He has the experience and is mature enough not to get drawn into the mud. He is a president.

 @antnyj

The winner is Hillary Clinton. The losers? The Republican Party. Outside of their bubble, the candidates are seen as a circus.

 @SujOfficial

In an election in which the alpha male is desirable, hands down the debate goes to @realDonaldTrump.

 @realJoeMurray

Marco came in last, Kasich next to bottom, then a tie with Trump and Cruz.

Uniteds move to 10-across seating in the coach cabin of its 777s echoes a broader industry trend on the popular widebody. Boeing says airlines ordering the aircraft requested 10-across seating on about half of the 777s delivered last year. Thats up from about 30% in 2008, according to the U.S. jetmaker.

Even among U.S. carriers, American already flies some of its 777s with a 10-abreast layout in coach. Emirates, All Nippon Airways, Air New Zealand, KLM and Air France are among global carriers flying at least some of their 777s with 10 across in coach, a configuration that allows them to add more revenue-producing seats to the plane.

As for United, the update to its 19 Boeing 777s  set to begin this May  will increase capacity to 364 seats, including 28 in business class and 336 in coach. That will be a 20-seat increase over the comparable domestic-configured 777s that United currently uses on the domestic routes from Hawaii.

As has been rumored, the coach-class layout will feature 10-abreast seating in a 3-4-3 configuration. Currently, Uniteds domestic-configured 777s seat nine across in coach in a 2-5-2 layout. United expects to have all 19 of the 777s scheduled to get the retrofit completed by May 2017.

Uniteds 777s that remain on international routes will continue to seat 9-across in coach. Those 55 aircraft have up to 269 seats total.

While the economy cabin in the reconfigured domestic 777s will go from 9- to 10-abreast, there will be some upgrades. United will install in-seat power outlets throughout the cabin, including in coach.

The 777s will be Wi-Fi-enabled, allowing passengers to stream entertainment options to their personal devices. United also will install two mobile device holders  one for tablets and one for phones -- at each economy seat.

In business class, United will replace the recliner seats now on the domestic 777s with flatbed seats.

With the retrofits, all 19 of Uniteds 777-200 models of the jet will be in the domestic configuration. All 55 of Uniteds 777-200ERs will retain the international configuration. United has not yet revealed what its plans will be for the new 777-300ERs that are yet to be delivered to the carrier.

NEW YORK (AP)  Serena Williams says Maria Sharapova ""showed a lot of courage"" in taking responsibility for her failed drug test.

On Monday, the Russian star revealed she tested positive the day she lost to Williams in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. At a news conference Tuesday to promote an exhibition at Madison Square Garden, Williams didn't want to talk about the fact she had faced an opponent with a banned substance in her system.

The 21-time Grand Slam champion said that like the rest of the sports world, she was ""surprised and shocked"" to hear the news about Sharapova on Monday.

""I think most people were happy she was upfront and very honest and showed a lot of courage to admit to what she had done and what she had neglected to look at in terms of the list at the end of the year,"" Williams said.

Sharapova announced she tested positive for meldonium, a blood flow-promoting drug she said she had been taking for 10 years for various health issues. Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and players were notified of the changes in the WADA banned substances list in December. Sharapova claimed she simply neglected to click on the link.

She could face a long ban from the International Tennis Federation, possibly ending her season and preventing her from competing at the Olympics.

""It's just taking responsibility, which she admitted that she was willing to do and ready to do,"" Williams said. ""Just hope for the best for everybody in that situation.""

Sharapova and Williams have had some barbed words for each other in the past off the court, but on Tuesday, Williams was fully supportive. While Sharapova is one of her biggest rivals based on the Russian's results and five major titles, Williams has dominated the head-to-head series, winning the last 18 meetings over more than a decade.

""As Maria said, she's ready to take full responsibility,"" Williams said. ""She showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart. I think she's always shown courage and heart in everything she's done, and this is no different.""

Two-time Grand Slam finalist Caroline Wozniacki, who faces Williams in the exhibition Tuesday night, agreed with her good friend's assessment of Sharapova's announcement. Wozniacki acknowledged, though, the lengths that elite athletes typically go through to ensure they don't accidentally ingest banned substances.

""Any time we take any medication, we double, triple and quadruple check, because sometimes even things like cough drops or nasal sprays can be on the list,"" Wozniacki said. ""I think as athletes we always make sure to really make sure there's nothing in it.""

Lets see whos hot, and whos not.

Whos hot

Is anyone filling up a box score better than Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo? In his last five games, The Greek Freak is averaging 21 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 2.8 steals and 2.0 blocks per contest. Hes one of the games only legitimate five-category contributors.

Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker is so hot the only thing missing from his game is NBA Jam-style flame trails. In four games this month, Walker is posting 30.8 points, 6.8 assists and 5.5 rebounds, all while shooting a robust 54.1% from the field and 51.7% from three-point range. Boomshakalaka.

He has flashed talent before, but Phoenix Suns center Alex Len is finally getting a steady run and producing big-time numbers, particularly on the glass. In his last five games, Len is putting up 20.4 points, 14.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. Unlike the first two guys on this list he could still be available in your league. If he is, get him.

Since joining the Miami Heat, forward Joe Johnson is posting 14 points per night on a judicious 60.4% shooting  that includes 8-for-12 (66.7%) from downtown. Johnsons accuracy and scoring offers some sneaky value in larger leagues.

Whos not

Maybe Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love was the subject of LBJs latest round of cryptic tweets. The former All-Star is shooting a woeful 30.3% (15% from three) over his last six games, accounting for just 12.8 points and 6.5 boards per in that span.

It has been a rough start to March for Detroit Pistons forward Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who is hitting on just 25.8% of his shots and 11.1% of his three pointers thus far. After looking like a player on the rise in January, Caldwell-Pope isnt doing fantasy teams any favors right now.

Indiana Pacers forward Myles Turner appeared on the hot side not that long ago, but the rookie looks like he may be hitting the wall. In 28 minutes of action, Turner is managing a paltry 7.5 points and 5.3 rebounds while shooting just 31.5% over his last six. Keep him sidelined.

I know San Antonio is saving some bullets for the playoffs, but Spurs guard Tony Parker is taking it a little too far right now: 5.0 PPG, 5.3 APG, 2.3 RPG in March. Add to that 33.3% shooting and zero made threes and only those in deep leagues should consider riding this out.",[]

The America I know is gritty, plain-speaking and hardworking. It is also generous, patriotic and inclusive. It thrives on common sense and core values and understands the difference between right and wrong. The America I know bears no resemblance to the polite social circles and cocktail parties familiar to the news media, political and legal elites of Washington, D.C.

For decades, those in power have grown the federal bureaucracy into something that resembles a fourth branch of government. Those in power have dictated to the rest of us the rules under which we have to live, often without regard to whether it makes sense in our communities. They have also played a large part in selecting Republican presidential nominees; since 1960, all have been men who served as governor, senator or vice president.

How is that working for us?

Today, we are $19 trillion in debt, and our economy leaves nearly 12 million of our neighbors unemployed.

My hometown of Williamsport, Pa., is a four-hour drive from the Capitol. I love Williamsport, but my neighbors are hurting. It is a world away from the tidy suburbs and tony enclaves around Washington where power is concentrated. Washington is simply not capable of understanding the concerns of the America I know.

Consider McLean, Va., the home of USA TODAY. The annual median income in McLean is $188,639, compared with just $33,537 in my hometown of Williamsport and $35,602 in Anacostia, an urban area within sight of the Capitol but worlds away from many who work there.

We are all responsible for the social and economic ills affecting rural and urban America, but only one candidate for president has given voice to our collective frustration.

America will win again. With the right leadership, well secure our borders, defeat the Islamic State, make trade deals that put our interests first and replace Obamacare while protecting the most vulnerable. Most important, we will grow our economy.

I am supporting Donald J. Trump for president because he, better than any other candidate, embraces the priorities of the America I know and love.

(Photo: Jordan Buie / The Tennessean)

One of the 12 Nashville jurors who awarded sports broadcaster Erin Andrews $55 million in damages Monday, after she was secretly filmed nude in her Nashville hotel room in 2008, said the trial's nine days and the deliberation that followed were an emotional roller coaster, one that pulled on his heart as a husband, father and Metro police officer.

A second juror said deciding how much money to award Andrews was the hardest part about the deliberations.

Noble Taylor, a 45-year-old sergeant with the Metro Nashville Police Department, said it was the testimony of Andrews father and his reaction, along with those of Andrews and Andrews mother, that convinced him the jury should give Andrews the full $75 million amount she requested.

Her dad was very emotional, he said. He brought some pictures, too, that just showed the daughter side of her, the family member side. I tried to leave myself out of it as best as I could, but it did affect me.""

But Taylor said not all of the jurors agreed with him, and that often the debate in the jury deliberation room was intense, heated and, at times, everything but physical.

At times we didnt really agree on anything, he said. Everything about this case was debated.

After seven hours of deliberation, the jury of seven women and five men awarded Andrews $55 million, and found Michael David Barrett, who filmed the videos and posted them online, 51 percent at fault and hotel owner and hotel management company, West End Hotel Partners and Windsor Capital Group, on the hook for the remaining 49 percent.

Taylor said he did not believe that the millions of page views the videos have received was a particularly significant point for jurors.

Taylor said the jurors watched Andrews for her emotions and to see how she dealt with what happened.

He also said he felt there were several arguments made by the defense that were self-destructive, such as pointing out that Andrews' career had progressed seemingly undeterred, perhaps even helped, by the nude videos, and that a few counseling sessions could help Andrews move beyond any emotional damages caused by their release.

It didnt sit too well with me,"" he said. ""A person like that, as I said before, shes driven, shes going to be driven no matter what happens, hopefully.

Juror Terry Applegate said she did not fault the defense for its focus on Andrews' success, as she expected that strategy.

""I think she persevered despite the video,"" Applegate said. ""Because of her strength of character she was really able to succeed in her career.""

But Applegate said that determining how much money to award was the most difficult question for jurors, in part because of the large figures involved.



Obviously, this was a very long and complicated case, said Applegate, 62. We considered not only the impact its had on Erin Andrews, but also the message, I guess you might say, that might be provided to the hotel industry overall.

Applegate said serving on the jury was a good experience.

I truly appreciated the opportunity to do it, although it was difficult and lengthy, she said. I think its true of every juror. We all remarked about how impressed we are about our judicial system here in the United States.

Both Taylor and Applegate said jurors were concerned about how Barrett was able to book rooms beside Andrews.

Applegate said the hotel and its manager did not provide testimony about supervision of the front desk. She said the defense left a few spots that did not hook together about the registration process that allowed Barrett to find Andrews room.

During a news briefing, one reporter asked Taylor what he thought about the defense being surprised by the jurys verdict and the amount awarded.

Well, I think Andrews family would have been surprised if they had lost, he said.

Ranting on social media, especially Twitter, has become something of a new art form, and there's no better titan of the Twitter tirade than Kanye West.

Not to mention his wife, Kim Kardashian, who's suddenly having a Twitter tantrum because she's the target of jokes and slams  from Bette Midler and Piers Morgan, among others  for her penchant for tweeting nude selfies.

She let loose with snarky tweets of her own Tuesday, plus another nude of herself, and a boast about her assets worthy of Donald Trump.

sorry I'm late to the party guys I was busy cashing my 80 million video game check & transferring 53 million into our joint account   Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 8, 2016

But all this metaphorical shrieking online, while hugely entertaining to many, leads to questions about the emotional well-being of some ranters, not to mention the level of discourse in our culture. Even the presidential race has devolved into a mess of sophomoric and vulgar taunts, often on Twitter.

Kim and Kanye, and their fellow ranters (Azealia Banks, Nicki Minaj, Iggy Azalea, Amber Rose, Rebel Wilson, to name just a few), however, are talking trash about stuff far less consequential than the presidency.

I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 24, 2016

I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 24, 2016

But what is the benefit of periodic paroxysms of Twitter twaddle, aimless babbling or venting of rage in 140 characters? Is this really good for the twaddlers, babblers and ragers?

Rob Shuter, a publicist-turned-gossip columnist, is all too familiar with the celebrity species of ranters. Now an online blogger as TheNaughtyGossip.com, Shuter says many of the celebs he has worked with ""love a good rant,"" and this was way before Twitter.

If a celeb just rants to people on her payroll  people who have to listen  well, no harm done. But now she can be florid in her ranting and everyone knows.

""Twitter allows people to get inside of who you truly are  it shines a spotlight,"" Shuter says. ""Some celebrities, if they have time on their hands and they're alone, that's when they're the most dangerous (on Twitter). They find themselves on airplanes with nothing to do for hours. They have a huge ego, and (here's a) way to express it.""

Twitter has given rise to a new area of psychology and psychologists who study the phenomenon of social-media ranting. Not only do plenty of non-celebs do it, there are actually websites  ""rant-sites,"" such as justrage.com  dedicated to enabling people to vent in public about, well, whatever ticks them off.

Why do we rant, and do we rant more because of Twitter?

""The short-term answer is that people do it because it feels good in the moment,"" says Ryan Martin, chairman of the psychology department at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and co-author of the paper Anger on the Internet: The Perceived Value of Rant-Sites.

Jennifer Golbeck, an associate professor who studies social media at the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies, says humans have always ranted; now they can rant to millions instead of just those within shouting distance.

Social media provides an outlet, she says, ""when you're alone and upset and your spouse no longer wants to hear. I can rant against the airlines and everyone can see me yelling at the airlines. And culturally that means it's OK to do it.""

Martin says that after venting, ""people say they feel calm, relaxed, relieved, and that's consistent with what we've known about human beings for thousands of years or more.""

The long-term consequence is that it's bad for us, he says. ""Because it feels good, it becomes our go-to expression, but it also keeps us thinking about our angry thoughts. We fall back on it and use it again and again, even when its going to get us in trouble.""

Plus, Golbeck says, many studies show that ranting eventually makes the ranter feel worse. ""If you just wait two minutes, your anger levels go down,"" she says. ""Venting may not make you feel better (over the long term), but it does make you do it more, because you're angry, and, hey, a whole audience is listening to me! Its a cycle.""

Ranter-in-chief these days surely has to be West, who has in the space of a few months engaged in multiple Twitter spats with other celebs, ranging from Wiz Khalifa to Taylor Swift, and sent out bursts of a dozen stream-of-consciousness tweets at a time, moaning about his money problems, promoting his latest album/video/fashion line, comparing himself to Picasso and indulging in extended bouts of paranoia mixed with egomania.

On Monday, he declared the CD dead, announced that his music would be streamed only from now on, and then went off on his need ""to be me.""

question... Why do people not want me to be me?  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 7, 2016

please avoid trying to talk me out of being me in the future  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 7, 2016

Is such flamboyant tweet-ranting good for a celeb brand? If celebrities think it is, they're wrong, Shuter says.

""It's a mistake, because it always comes across as angry,"" he says. ""There is something to be said about clear, thoughtful, consistent thoughts, especially if you're trying to sell product or make a point in as few words as possible.""

SAN FRANCISCO  Amazon is tossing its oversize hat in the virtual-reality ring, joining content-producing rivals Hulu and Netflix in a quest to woo consumers with what promises to be the next great tech trend.

In a posting on the job networking and employer assessment site Glassdoor, Amazon is recruiting for a senior development manager for its VR program that requires 15-plus years of ""relevant engineering experience"" and a proven team-building track record.

The post, which was first reported by VR-news site Upload, notes that ""the future will not be limited to passive 2D experiences. The (Amazon) Virtual Reality team will explore and create the platform and interface for immersive storytelling. This will include an ingestion and playback platform for Virtual Reality experiences.""

Amazon declined to comment further on the posting.

The Seattle-based online retailer is among the leaders of a new generation of tech-owned content producers, recently receiving two Golden Globe awards for its Amazon Prime Video series Mozart in the Jungle. Netflix was also a big nominee at the January awards, though it did not win any for its critically acclaimed series House of Cards and Narcos.

Last fall, Hulu announced it would start producing original VR content, while Netflix created a VR movie theater app for Samsung's $99 Gear VR Powered by Oculus headset.

Amazon may well start creating content in VR, but given the company's core mission, it is as likely to use the technology to enhance the purchasing experience.

""Amazon ultimately is all about shopping, getting you into their (online) store and keeping you there,"" says Peter Csathy, CEO of business consulting and legal services firm Manatt Digital Media. ""The promise of VR immersive shopping is very significant and potentially massive, and Amazon can play in a way no one else can.

Besides, said Csathy, Amazon may want to offer content that complements all the VR-related gear for sale.

A number of high-end VR headsets will make their way into developers' hands this year, including devices from Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony PlayStation VR, priced anywhere from around $500 to $2,000, depending on whether they come bundled with a computer to power the tethered device. The holy grail for both virtual- and augmented-reality gear engineers is to create headgear able to produce crystalline images without being physically connected to a PC.

Google also is said to be working on expanding its VR offerings, which are at the moment rooted to its smartphone-based Cardboard device. Apple has not yet said publicly whether it is delving into VR, but it's tough to imagine any major tech company sitting on the VR sidelines given industry adviser Digi-Capital's prediction of a $120 billion VR/AR business by 2020.

But heres our best guess at how each American League East team will line up from 1 to 9:

Baltimore Orioles

LF Hyun Soo Kim

3B Manny Machado

1B Chris Davis

CF Adam Jones

C Matt Wieters

RF Mark Trumbo

DH Pedro Alvarez

2B Jonathan Schoop

SS J.J. Hardy

Re-signing Davis was huge for this offense. The majors leading home run hitter in two of the last three years provides a needed left-handed power bat in the middle of the lineup.

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Trumbo fits best as a DH but will have to play some right field because of the teams limited depth and the recent addition of Alvarez. However, as long as hes healthy he should be a 30-homer threat at hitter-friendly Camden Yards.

Fowler would have filled another void: leadoff. Kim had an excellent on-base percentage in Korea, but it might be a bit much to ask him to take over the role right away.

Boston Red Sox

RF Mookie Betts

2B Dustin Pedroia

SS Xander Bogaerts

DH David Ortiz

1B Hanley Ramirez

3B Pablo Sandoval

LF Rusney Castillo

C Blake Swihart

CF Jackie Bradley Jr.

Betts could be one of this seasons breakout stars. He does everything well and, considering the teams overall offensive firepower, could lead the league in plate appearances and runs. Bogaerts ranked third in the majors with 196 hits last season but only seven were home runs. Hes 23, so its time to start seeing more power.

After the All-Star break, no one had more RBI (65) or a higher slugging percentage (.701) than Ortiz. His farewell tour should end with a bang. The big question is how Ramirez will adapt to playing first base. Last years move to the outfield was a disaster  offensively and defensively  so a late-game exit might happen more often than his fantasy owners would like.

Daily fantasy favorite Chris Young will start against left-handed pitchers after hitting .327 with a .575 slugging percentage against them last season.

New York Yankees

CF Jacoby Ellsbury

LF Brett Gardner

RF Carlos Beltran

1B Mark Teixeira

DH Alex Rodriguez

C Brian McCann

3B Chase Headley

SS Didi Gregorius

2B Starlin Castro

With an average age of nearly 33, this starting lineup is full of injury and health risks. Ellsbury was hampered by a sprained knee for a good part of last season. Gardner is out with a wrist injury until mid-March. Texieira missed all of September with a broken leg. And that was all before slugging young first baseman Greg Bird was lost for the season with a torn labrum.

AL East | Central | West

Rodriguez is the elder statesman at 40. Though he had a fantastic comeback season with 33 home runs, he ties up the DH spot that could be used to give the other veterans a day off in the field.

The acquisitions of Castro, 25, and Aaron Hicks, 26, are steps in the right direction. Hicks can play all three outfield positions  unfortunately, not at the same time.

Tampa Bay Rays

CF Kevin Kiermaier

2B Logan Forsythe

3B Evan Longoria

RF Corey Dickerson

LF Desmond Jennings

1B James Loney

DH Logan Morrison

C Hank Conger

SS Brad Miller

Forsythe was a godsend last year with 17 home runs and 68 RBI. The addition of Dickerson will give the lineup another power threat and provide Longoria with a bit better protection. How well Dickerson makes the transition from hitter-friendly Coors Field could be the key to this offenses success.

The Rays likely will play matchups at several spots in the lineup. Steve Pearce should spell Loney at first against lefties. Shortstop and former No. 1 overall pick Tim Beckham has shown some home run pop vs. southpaws, but Miller was acquired to be the regular starter at short.

Toronto Blue Jays

CF Kevin Pillar

3B Josh Donaldson

RF Jose Bautista

DH Edwin Encarnacion

SS Troy Tulowitzki

1B Chris Colabello

C Russell Martin

LF Michael Saunders

2B Ryan Goins

The Jays led the majors in about every offensive category last season and will have a healthy Tulowitzki from Day 1. Though he hit leadoff, Tulowitzki will move into a better run-producing spot in the order.

usatoday.com,2012-07-13 00:00:00,Food for thought: The challenge of healthy eating on campus,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Annie Massa', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Alexandra Samuels', 'Sam Lisker', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today']","Many college students arent even eating one serving of fruits or vegetables in a day.

If you eat most of your meals in a college cafeteria or have a meal plan, maybe you know the feeling: You walk in to your campus dining hall with every intention to eat a healthy meal, but just one look at the salad bars limp greens and mealy tomatoes has you opting for a slice of pizza instead. Sometimes the limited selection of wholesome dining hall fare makes it easy for college students to put healthy eating aspirations on the back burner.

Results of a recent poll by the International Food Information Council Foundation show American adults are trying and failing to fit in the average government-recommended 4.5-5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day  a struggle thats familiar to college students. In fact, many students arent even eating one serving of fruits or vegetables in a day, according to a study of student eating habits published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior last August.

But is this really a surprise? Bound to campus dining services by meal plans or convenience, students encounter all kind of obstacles to balanced eating. Poor variety of fruits and veggies, the high cost of fresh food in comparison to processed snacks and limited access to nutritional information in cafeterias can all stand in the way of eating well at school.

It doesnt have to be that way, though. Take City University of New York (CUNY), for example, where promoting healthy eating has become a major priority in recent years. The Healthy CUNY Initiative, which aims to transform CUNY into the healthiest urban university in America by 2016, introduced the Campaign for Healthy Food (CUNY CHeF) in 2011. The campaign, with the support of the New York Department of Health, is designed to improve the health of CUNYs 250,000 degree students and its faculty and staff, by making healthier choices easier in cafeterias, vending machines and meetings.

For many campus administrators around the country, food is seen more as a revenue stream for strapped universities than as a vehicle for improving health. We have worked to change that perception, explained Nicholas Freudenberg, co-director of the Healthy CUNY Initiative and public health professor at the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, in an email.

In its earliest stages, CUNY CHeF rigorously assessed what kinds of snack and beverage options were available to students on CUNY campuses and conducted surveys about their eating habits. These surveys helped focus and guide the campaigns action, including a movement to post nutritional information for foods in CUNY cafeterias (requested by over 90% of student survey respondents).

The campaign hasnt always been easy. Penniless college students arent always eager to shell out more money for healthier food. Cost is a challenge. Most students are on a tight budget and healthier foods can be more expensive, said CUNY CHeF project coordinator Patti Lamberson in an email. Lamberson added that sometimes cafeteria management is reluctant to change up menus for fear of losing money on new initiatives.

Nonetheless CUNYs ambitious healthy eating program has made some serious strides so far. Over two years, about 125 student advocates have been trained to campaign for healthier foods on CUNY campuses. Based on research and polls of students and faculty, CUNY CHeF has released a report recommending strategies that the each individual CUNY campus, and the community as a whole, can take to improve healthy food options for students.

Even at other institutions where such sweeping healthy eating programs havent quite taken hold yet, cafeterias can take some simple measures to encourage healthy and balanced student diets. They can make tap water freely available and reduce processed snack food and candy offerings in order to stock salad bars with more fresh ingredients. College dining services may even want to consider partnerships with community farmers markets, in order to support the local economy while providing healthier food options to students.

Freudenberg is convinced that, as student desire for healthier food increases, college cafeterias will have no choice but to start meeting their demand. In the long run, university food services can promote health and make money. Our surveys of students show that most students want healthier, tastier and more affordable food to be sold on campus, said Freudenberg.

Ultimately, as is already happening with tobacco policies, universities will recognize that making healthy food available on campus is part of being a responsible caring institution. The only question is who will be the leaders and who the laggards. We are proud to be making City University of New York a leader.

Bottom line? When colleges prioritize healthy eating, its a whole lot easier for students to do the same on a personal level.",[]

(Photo: John Moore, Getty Images)

The use of military drones over U.S. soil appears to be perfectly legal, but some question why the program has been largely shrouded in mystery and say local governments should assume more control over the practice.

The Pentagon has used spy drones over the United States over the past decade, but did not publicize that fact until it responded to a Freedom of Information Act request, known as a ""FOIA."" Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, wondered why it took so long to provide information on a program that's been operating since 2006.

""If everything is so legal, then it shouldn't take a FOIA request to find out about it,"" Friedman said.

The Pentagon has publicly posted at least a partial list of the drone missions that have flown in non-military airspace over the United States and explains the use of the aircraft, many to aid in local disasters. But that list is not well known.

Friedman did not question the overall legality of the program. He said using military personnel and equipment on U.S. soil is a common practice, including training at military bases and providing assistance to local law enforcement agencies during emergencies. He gave the example of National Guard troops helping to locate victims after natural disasters.

Drones, he said, are simply an extension of that practice.

That mirrors the findings of a legal analysis conducted by the Pentagon's inspector general, which found the Pentagon's infrequent use of the military drones over U.S. soil  fewer than 20 times from 2006 to 2015  to be lawful. According to a Pentagon report, then secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld signed an interim policy on Sept. 28, 2006, designed to govern the use of military drones over the U.S.

That remained in force until superseded early last year by a policy with a more standardized approval process.

The inspector general analysis found that while Pentagon can legally assist civil authorities when requested, the use of drones was new ground. There was no federal statute that addressed what to do if a governor or a state emergency official requested the use of a military drone for some form of surveillance, such as in floods, fires or other disasters.

So the Pentagon drafted an interim policy that mirrored how the military provides other forms of assistance to civil authorities when requested. But the policy was made highly restrictive, according to the inspector general analysis, requiring that each request receive explicit approval by the secretary of Defense or someone designated by the secretary.

""Great care is taken by DoD (Department of Defense) personnel to protect the American public's civil liberties and privacy rights while simultaneously preparing to employ UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) capabilities,"" the inspector general concluded.

Friedman said he would be more comfortable if local governments and law enforcement agencies stopped borrowing the military drones and instead purchased their own. By doing so, he said there would be more oversight of the programs and more input from the very U.S. citizens who could find a drone flying over their backyard.

""It's an accountability concern,"" Friedman said. ""You'd like to know if you're a voter in California or Ohio if your authorities feel they need to be flying Predator drones. You'd like to be able to have some kind of democratic debate about that.""

""Driver, take me to jail.""

That's the beginning of Maryum Ali's trip to a different kind of reality-TV challenge: jail. 60 Days In jail.

The Los Angeles social worker and six others with no arrest records signed up to be undercover inmates (and witnesses) for the 12-episode series on A&E, premiering with two episodes Thursday (9 ET/PT, moving to 10 on March 17). The volunteers came from different places and backgrounds, were booked on fake charges and held for 60 days in Clark County Correctional Jail in Jeffersonville, Ind.

Why did they participate? ""I've always wanted to know what jail was like,"" Ali says. ""I spent the greater part of my profession trying to prevent at-risk kids from going to jail.""

Ali, the eldest daughter of boxing great Muhammad Ali, had to use an alias. And the jail, where about 500 inmates are housed before being released or going to trial, is in a town just across the Ohio River from Louisville, her father's birthplace.

""When they told me the location, I almost said, 'I'm not gonna do it.' I might have cousins in there. I have family members in Louisville,"" Ali says.

Dad didn't know about the show, Ali says, who was ""arrested"" on charges of domestic battery and intimidation with a knife. ""I might watch an episode with him if I'm in Arizona standing right next to him so he knows that's not real.""

Each volunteer told just two other adults about their participation in the project. Ali informed her sister and an aunt. Stay-at-home mom Barbra, 25, told her husband and her mother, who helped take care of her two young children while she was locked up.

""I really was looking to gain a new perspective. And try to really help this jail out, and I really wanted to help the sheriff as best I could,"" says Barbra, who is not using her last name and was taken into custody for fraud.

Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, a veteran of the Indiana State Police, worked with producers to select the participants. Because he had just been elected to local office, he was interested in overhauling the Clark County Jail, which had been notorious as a source for drugs.

Noel, who had invited local news stations on raids, says he thought that if it could let the public ""know what's going on behind bars, maybe it'll start clicking with people that 'that's not a place I want to go.'""

60 Days In executive producer Gregory Henry says that Noel realized the value of having real people offer their perspectives, and the idea for volunteer inmates ""really rolled from there. It starts with an audacious notion of, how do you put someone who has not been arrested into a jail? And it really resonated with the reforms that he wanted to put into place and the things that he urgently wanted to know about his facility.""

But how frightening was it for the participants?

""I felt nervous at the booking process,"" Ali says. ""At booking, you really have to be this other person. You can't say anything.""

And once behind bars, the noise didn't help. ""Jail was not peaceful. That kind of wore me out, mentally a little bit.""

But she was lucky, ""I never saw violence on a level that scared me.""

When she started her time, Barbra says, ""I was terrified. I was absolutely petrified  the most scared I've ever been in my life."" But she says the series had a big impact on her own life, which she described as having fallen into a gray area with her daily routine.

""I am seeing in colors for the first time in a long time,"" she says. ""I am so thankful for everything I have.""

Participants housed in the same unit had not met each other before entering jail, which added to the paranoia. ""Oh my God, the mind games are ridiculous,"" Ali says.

The sheriff and the producers weren't resting easy.

""I watched these undercover participants like hawks, along with the producers,"" Noel says.

Henry, who explained that the show helped upgrade the jail's security system and participants were compensated, says, ""I've never worked on a project where I have no control. This show is so real that it hurt. We all just had pits in our stomachs because we had, in addition to the 300 cameras, we had roughly 70 microphones. We could hear every conversation. We could hear every cell. ... You hear what you've never heard before.""

usatoday.com,2015-05-20 00:00:00,8 fastest-growing companies make you rich,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","What are the fastest-growing big companies? Its not just a trivia question. You can score big gains from knowing the answer.

There are eight stocks in the Standard & Poors 500, including specialty drugmaker Actavis (ACT), homebuilder DR Horton (DHI) and social networking king Facebook (FB) that have been consistently putting up huge revenue growth  including in the just-completed first calendar quarter, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. These fastest-growers are also huge stock market winners. These companies boosted revenue by 20% or greater in both 2013 and 2014, in addition to the first quarter of 2015. And analysts still think six of the eight stocks still have upside.

Fast-growth is getting increasingly difficult to find  a truth not being lost on investors who are willing to pay up for it. The eight stocks putting up the strongest revenue growth are up an average of 40.4% over the past year  absolutely blowing away the 13% gain by the S&P 500.

Its understandable investors would reward growth  but why is there such a large premium? The reason: A noticeable and worsening lack of growth elsewhere among large companies. So far, 93% of companies have reported their profit for the first quarter, and revenue slumped 1.6%. These eight high-growth companies, on the other hand, reported an average of 35% of revenue growth in the first quarter.

The dearth of growth isnt likely to subside anytime soon. S&P 500 companies are expected to post lower revenue in the next two quarters and 0.8% decline for the full year, says S&P Capital IQ. When theres a lack of supply, you know what happens to price.

The mismatch between the availability of revenue growth and the demand for it by investors is reflected in stock prices of these eight stocks. Not only are shares of the fast-growing stocks beating the market in the past 12 months  theyre expected to rise further still as a group over the next 18 months, too. Six of the eight fast-growing companies are rated outperform or better and as a group, the eight still have an average of 6.6% upside before hitting their 18-month price targets.

Some of the expected stock gains are much higher than the average  even among the high-growth group. Take Actavis, a maker of drugs to treat conditions ranging from womens health disorders to dermatology. The company posted 2013 and 2014 revenue growth of 47% and 51% respectively. And during the first quarter, revenue jumped another 60%. Given those huge revenue gains, its easy to see why the stock is up 43%. But even so, analysts think the stock still has 16.3% upside before hitting the $346.95 average price target. Shares closed Tuesday at $298.43.

Facebook is another example of a high-growth stock where analysts still see potential. Revenue has jumped by more than 50% in 2013 and 2015 and notched up another 42% in the first quarter. Facebook remains the social media stock to own, with shares up 36% the past year. But even so, analysts think the stock can rise 18% before hitting the $95.44 a share price target. Shares closed at $80.63 on Tuesday.

Sometimes, though, investors can overdue the chase for growth  which could take away the stocks winning ways going forward, or at least make them tougher to come by. Netflix could be an example of that. The company is growing like mad  even faster than analysts expected. Revenue jumped 24% in the first quarter. But giddy investors sent the shares up 69% over the past year to close Tuesday at $616.48. Thats already roughly 5% past what analysts think the stock is worth.

When growth is hard to find, investors are prepared to pay up. Just make sure youre getting your moneys worth.

SAN FRANCISCO  Cloud storage company Box, which announced its fourth quarter results Wednesday, continues to battle its way to profitability in what promises to be a challenging year for many Silicon Valley startups and unicorns.

The company said it narrowed its per share loss to 26 cents per share on $85 million in revenue for the quarter, beating expectations of a 29 cent EPS loss on $82 million in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst estimates.

The year-on-year improvement from a loss of $1.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 was enough to lift the stock. Box (BOX) shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading after gaining 4% at $12.55 during the regular session.

Under founder and CEO Aaron Levie, Box has been investing in security, compliance and administrative technology with a vision to further streamline its services in order to allow customers to share and collaborate on cloud-based projects. Partnerships with former rivals such as Microsoft and Salesforce are helping Levie secure his position in the space.

Among the other highlights: Box revenue for full year 2016 was $303 million, up 40% year-over-year, while the $85 million in revenue for the quarter represents a 36% year-over-year gain. The company also touted that it had ""achieved (its) first positive cash flow from operations as a public company in the fourth quarter of FY 2016 of $5 million."" The progress puts it on track to achieve positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017, it said.

Even with Wednesday's gain, Box shares still have a long way to go to recoup their initial surge in the public market.

That event initially boded well for Levie, who started the company while still in college. Anticipating demand, the stock was priced at $14 and soared 66% immediately to $20 in January 2015. The company was briefly valued at $1.7 billion, before the stock started heading south for the better part of the year. Its current market cap is $1.4 billion.

USCs Department of Public Safety (DPS) is also investigating the incident, according to Christian Gunning, associate vice president for University Relations.

Sophomore Ivan Tsang says he was relaxing at a communal fireplace outside USCs Cardinal Gardens apartments when the first of three eggs were thrown at him as someone yelled, Ching Chang Chong mother-r gay.

A native of Hong Kong, Tsang took to Facebook to express his frustration and disappointment.

I chose USC for the sole purpose of escaping the reality of Racism, hoping to settle in a much more contemporary and diverse community. I guess I thought wrong, he said.

A suspect sent an apology message to Tsang via Facebook later Sunday, the L.A. Times reported.

The suspect reached out to the victim on Facebook and tried to apologize, LAPD Det. R. Saafir told The Times. He says hes Asian too, that he had a little too much to drink.

The university also responded to the incident Sunday night, issuing a statement to the student body denouncing the behavior.

We have a zero tolerance policy for any conduct that threatens or intimidates our students, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry wrote in the statement.

Last September at USC, a student hurled a drink out a fraternity window at Student Body President Rini Sampath, shouting, You Indian piece of s***t, which she then wrote about on Facebook.

USCs student government has since made inclusivity a top priority, and government leaders have organized a diversity task force to submit recommendations to the administration.

Their proposals have centered on increasing resources for cultural centers, and establishing educational programs and administrative positions dedicated to diversity, Sampath tells USA TODAY College.

Our work seeks to create institutional policy changes, but it is up to the student community to remember we must practice love and care for one another every day, Sampath says.

Jonathan Wang, the director of USCs Asian and Pacific American Student Services, says the work the student government has accomplished has been extremely valuable but he urges the conversation to continue.

I think what is clear is that issues of discrimination and issues of racism still occur on campus regardless of how much work we are putting towards it, Wang says. Some our students still dont feel like they belong on campus here.

Reactions to the deal were mixed. Some Red Sox and Yankees fans felt the signing was the second coming of the Johnny Damon deal, with the Yankees grabbing away another likable Red Sox center fielder and, in doing so, hurting their biggest rival.

This is silly. The Red Sox were never going to pay what Ellsbury (and his agent Scott Boras) wanted. Ellsbury is 30 years old and has been injury-prone is his career so far. The Yankees just gave him a seven-year deal. Lets count all the ways this is problematic.

1. The Yankees will be paying Jacoby Ellsbury $20 million a year until hes 37

So the Yankees just went through a nasty ordeal in which they needed a league suspension to (hopefully) get out of paying a declining superstar (Alex Rodriguez) a massive amount of money every year. So, lets say they are granted this incredibly lucky reprieve  before its even finalized they turn around and offer a another massive contract to a guy entering his 30s? Um, what?

2. Ellsbury is known for his speed, something that typically declines in human beings when they are in their late 30s

Yankees fans lamented Alex Rodriguezs decline, and the massive amount of money he was owed, when his bat speed slowed down a bit. Know what deteriorates faster than bat speed in guys as they age? Speed speed. Ellsbury is a phenomenal hitter, but he relies as much on his legs as anything, both on offense and defense. Well see how fast he is when hes 35, and how happy Yankees are that he still has two years left on his deal.

3. The Yankees already have Brett Gardner

Wait, the Yankees already have a speedy, 30-year-old center fielder whos stolen 50 bases in a season before? Yes, yes they do. Now, Ellsbury is a better player than Gardner. No one is arguing that. But is he that much of an improvement to justify spending $150 million over seven years? To the people who respond: But Gardner is injury prone! um, have you met Jacoby Ellsbury?

4. The Yankees have not learned from the mistakes of others

Two years ago, the Angels spent huge bucks to sign Albert Pujols. Last year, they spent huge money signing Josh Hamilton. Both were in their early thirties, and had produced big numbers up until that point. Both immediately fell off from their peak production, and now the Angels are saddled with two massive contracts, when all they want to do is build around their young phenom Mike Trout.

Everyone thought those two deals made the lessons clear: Dont pay guys for past performance. Dont overpay for guys entering the tail end of their careers. Dont get stuck with long-term deals with aging superstars that youll regret later.

The Yankees apparently learned nothing from these deals. They threw big money at Ellsbury, and theyll probably throw big money to keep Robinson Cano, who is 31. If they can win a title in the next couple years with Ellsbury and Cano at the heart of their lineup, then they made a good call. If they miss that window, though, it might be a rough few years in the Bronx.",[]

Spring break beckons  as does the Florida primary  bringing both parties down to the Sunshine State for back-to-back debates this week.

Three days after their face-off in Flint, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders hit the debate stage in Miami on Wednesday night, followed by the Republican candidates on Thursday. Somehow, we doubt they'll all be getting together to enjoy 2-for-1 rum runners on South Beach in between.

Here's your viewer's guide to Wednesday's action.

When does the debate start?

The debate, sponsored by The Washington Post and Univision, kicks off at 9 p.m. ET. It'll air live on Univision in Spanish and will be simulcast on CNN and Fusion in English, with live streams on Univision.com, washingtonpost.com and CNN.com.

Where will it be held?

It'll take place at Miami Dade College, ahead of Florida's primary on March 15.

Who will moderate?

Moderators are Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for The Washington Post, and Noticiero Univision co-anchors Maria Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos.

When is the next debate?

Get ready for a #DemDebate break: There are no specific dates or locations set for the April and May debates. On the Republican side, there's the Thursday debate in Miami followed by a March 21 debate in Salt Lake City, along with a possible debate grand finale in April.

The German luxury automaker reported that it earned $6.6 billion for last year, a 10 percent increase over the previous year, the Associated Press reports. It sold 2.2 million vehicles worldwide, a 6.1% increase. And revenue was up 14.6%.

Much of the growth came from sales of SUVs. Sales of the X4 crossover, for instance, doubled to 55,050 and worldwide sales of the X5 were up 14.1%. The X6 was up 53.1%.

But BMW did well on cars, too. Even its Rolls-Royce division reported the second best year on record.

Luxury car makers saw huge gains last year, right along with a rising stock market and higher consumer confidence. BMW has also increased its footprint in the U.S., where it has expanded its factories in recent years.

BMW just celebrated its 100th birthday the week with predictions that we are quickly entering an era of self-driving cars. It says it intends to be ready, both for cars that drive themselves and ones that let the driver take over and use technology to enhance the experience behind the wheel.

NASHVILLE  After tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, Taylor Allen Force came to Nashville with an eye toward the future.

The U.S. Army veteran enrolled at Vanderbilt University in 2015 to earn his MBA. A family member and a close friend told The Tennessean that Force hoped the education would offer an opportunity to put the discipline he had honed in the military and as an Eagle Scout to work in a new setting.

Maybe he would help out with the family business, or maybe he would work with veterans like himself who were making the transition to civilian life. Whatever steps he took, people close to him agreed, success was within the 28-year-old's reach.

But on Tuesday, during a school trip to Israel with his Vanderbilt classmates, a flurry of unexpected violence cut that bright future short.

Force was stabbed to death during a series of attacks that also injured a dozen Israeli civilians and police officers throughout Tel Aviv. Authorities in Israel said the attacks were carried out by Palestinians, and a number of high-ranking officials in the U.S. have condemned the violence as terrorism.

The attacker who killed Force was shot and killed in the days rash of violence, as were three other Palestinian assailants. It was the latest in a wave of near-daily Palestinian assaults on Israeli civilians and security forces that erupted in mid-September.

The sudden loss shook Force's friends, family and classmates. Reached by telephone Wednesday, Barrett Caldwell, a close friend who helped Force move into his Nashville apartment last year, said he sat in a parking lot and sobbed soon after hearing the news.

Force was there for everyone and made a contribution to the betterment of those around him,"" Caldwell said. Thats the memory I had of him.

""He made people better.

AN ARMY MAN

Before moving to Nashville, much of Force's life revolved around his commitment to the Army.

Force grew up in Lubbock, Texas, but went to a military high school in New Mexico. He went on to college at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, following in the footsteps of his paternal grandfather, his cousin Jamie Southwick said.

After Force graduated in 2009 with a degree in engineering management, he went on to achieve the rank of captain. He served in Iraq from September 2010 to August 2011 and in Afghanistan from October 2012 to July 2013, according to the military.

It was never about him. He pulled back from that idea of being braggadocio or beating his chest,"" Caldwell said. You go into that knowing that youre going to be called to lead and called to serve.""

When he was ready to step further into civilian life, Force decided to use the G.I. Bill to get an advanced degree. Caldwell, who lived in Nashville at the time, said Force was leaning toward going to the University of Texas at Austin, but their conversations ultimately helped him change his mind.

At the end of the day he chose Nashville for the same reason I think a lot of us do,"" Caldwell said. He saw that vibrancy of life.""

'SERVED AND LOVED OTHERS'

Force's deep Texas drawl and cowboy boots helped him fit in while in Music City. He loved listening to country and bluegrass music, and Caldwell and Southwick said Force liked taking advantage of the live music venues a few minutes away from his apartment.

He lived in Lexington, Ky., before moving to Tennessee, and made regular trips back to visit a horse he bought after leaving the Army.

Stuart Force, Taylor Force's father, told The Associated Press that his son had been making friends and having a great time at Vanderbilt, and he was very excited about the trip to Israel.

""He just wanted to further his education and explore more of the civilian side of life,"" Stuart Force said.

Taylor Force and 28 other Vanderbilt graduate students went to Israel with professors and staff to learn about global entrepreneurship through meetings with startup companies, according to a statement from the university. No one else on the trip was hurt; the university is arranging for their return to the United States.

Other business students also had traveled to different international destinations for special instruction during Vanderbilt's spring break.

Force's passion for service shone through even at Vanderbilt, according to Caldwell, who remembers joining Force and his classmates at a local bar.

He said Force noticed a classmate who was standing off to the side, not talking to anyone. Force made a beeline to the student, bought him a drink and struck up a conversation.

He served and loved others, Caldwell said. That was Taylor.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Falcons agree to 5-year deal with center Alex Mack,"['Est March', 'P M']","(Photo: The Associated Press)

ATLANTA (AP)  The Atlanta Falcons took an aggressive approach to the start of free agency on Wednesday by agreeing to terms on a five-year, $47.5 million contract with three-time Pro Bowl center Alex Mack.

The deal makes the longtime Cleveland Browns starter the NFL's highest-paid center, with an average salary of $9.5 million.

The Falcons also reached an agreement with quarterback Matt Schaub, who will be returning to the city where he launched his NFL career.

Falcons coach Dan Quinn said he believes Mack will improve an offensive line that has struggled in recent years.

Quinn said he was won over by his study of Mack's work, including ""the consistency each week in his performance. ... He is completely dialed in on the technique.""

""Then I found out the character and what he stands for and the way he likes to play, all those things added to it,"" Quinn added. ""Competition is the central theme of the program and the way he plays, man, does he represent that.""

Mack, 30, will be a good fit for Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan's zone-blocking scheme. Shanahan spent the 2014 season with Mack as Cleveland's offensive coordinator. Mack missed 11 games that season with a broken leg, but started the other 101 games in his seven seasons with the Browns.

The Falcons have had instability at center since longtime starter Todd McClure retired following the 2012 season. Mike Person, James Stone and Gino Gradkowski started at the position last season.

Mack was set to make $24 million over the next three years on a contract he signed in 2014 before he opted out to become an unrestricted free agent.

""This was an extremely difficult decision,"" Mack said in a statement released by his agent, Timothy Younger. ""After careful consideration, I concluded it was time to start a new chapter in my life. Over the last seven years, I have established friendships with teammates, coaches, and staff that will last a lifetime.""

Added Mack: ""I certainly will miss the Dawg Pound! I am VERY thankful and grateful for the opportunity and privilege to have played for the Browns organization, and I did my level best always to represent the team well.""

The interior offensive line is an offseason priority for the Falcons, along with linebacker and wide receiver.

The team prepared for free agency by releasing three veterans: wide Roddy White, safety William Moore and linebacker Justin Durant.

Quinn confirmed Bengals free-agent receiver Mohamed Sanu will visit the Falcons this week and that Rams free-agent linebacker James Laurinaitis visited on Tuesday.

Quinn said the deal with Mack leaves financial flexibility to address other needs.

""We've got a good plan that we're still working through with other players to add to the team,"" Quinn said. ""We don't feel at any way hamstrung or limited in that fashion. Alex is certainly an important piece to what we're doing, but ... I'm going to go right back to it to see over the next few days what other guys we can add to the club.""

Schaub was a third-round pick by Atlanta in 2004. After three years as a backup with the Falcons, Schaub was traded to Houston before the 2007 season. He spent seven seasons with the Texans, starting 88 of 90 games, before serving as a backup with Oakland and Baltimore the past two seasons.

In two starts with the Ravens in 2015, Schaub completed 52 of 80 passes for 540 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions.

Schaub will compete for the top backup job behind starter Matt Ryan.

The Falcons also released nose tackle Paul Soliai, who started 24 games the past two seasons.

He never made a start for the Seahawks before bouncing around the league.

Well, Flynn had a very hot take on the deals handed out to quarterbacks today.

Goin' places that I've never been

Seein' things that I may never see again

And I can't wait to get on the road again

Willie Nelson's ode to the road isn't just a song. It's a way of living.

Like many others, I've felt the call of the road throughout my life. Heading out on the highway is again on the rise  perhaps, in part because of throwback gas prices  with Americans setting records for miles traveled in 2015, according to the Department of Transportation.

More to explore than to riff on oil economics, I've joined three co-workers  Jim Lenahan and Patrick Foster, who produce Dad Rock, USA TODAY's music podcast, and Managing Editor of Multimedia Steve Elfers  in cutting a swath across the U.S. headed south by southwest to absorb music, history, food ... and beer.

In destinations such as Asheville, N.C., Nashville, Memphis and Dallas, we're seeing the sights, diving into the local culture  especially music and music history  and documenting what we find on the way to the South By Southwest Festival in Austin.

From left, Mike Snider, Jim Lenahan and Patrick Foster before leaving USA TODAY headquarters in McLean, Va., on March 8, 2016. (Photo: Steve Elfers, USA TODAY)

Among our expected stops: The Country Music Hall of Fame, the Grand Ole Opry, Graceland, Sun Studios and Stax Records. In each city, I'll investigate a small, independent craft brewery, as these establishments have become local gathering places and residential points of pride.

Some of us will be bunking in a restored vintage 1964 Airstream, something that is conjuring up miles of memories from my childhood. As a teen growing up in Kansas, we'd pack up the camper, which rested atop my father's Ford pickup, and hit the road to see the haunting Mesa Verde cliff dwellings, ride the narrow gauge train and pan for gold in the old mining towns of southwestern Colorado. Other times, with our boat in tow, we sped off to water ski and swim in the crystal clear lakes surrounded by the Ozark mountains.

In college, I continued my road-tripping ways. My fraternity brothers and I took joyrides to Louisville and South Bend, Ind., just to watch our beloved University of Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team.

Music often awaits at the end of the road. For another college road trip, a carful of us drove all night to attend a Rolling Stones outdoor show at the University of Colorado's Folsom Field. Years later, my friend John and I made a beeline from the Ozarks for a Dire Straits concert at the Oklahoma City Zoo Amphitheatre. A Bruce Springsteen performance in St. Louis led another pal, Tim, and I to traverse Missouri.

Jack Kerouac wrote in On the Road that ""the road is life,"" and on one of my USA TODAY assignments two decades ago I met a college professor who turned that dictum into a course called The Majic Bus. The professor, noted U.S. historian Douglas Brinkley, took his students on the road in a sleeper bus across the country to see historic spots and meet famous writers, politicians and musicians including Jimmy Carter, Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut and Maya Angelou.

They read Mark Twain alongside the Gateway Arch and considered William Faulkner while exploring Oxford, Miss. I so enjoyed meeting him and his students that the next year, I spent several weeks on the road with them chronicling their travels. ""The road unshackles the American psyche like nothing else,"" Brinkley wrote in a 1993 book about his inaugural American Odyssey course.

My wife, Julie, recently offered the observation that before you marry someone, you should go on vacation with them. I unwittingly followed that practice nearly 20 years ago by asking her if she would like to fly to Kansas City, visit my parents and then cruise west to see the Rockies, a sight she had yet to experience.

Our swing through Colorado included a stay at The Stanley Hotel, the inspiration for Stephen King's The Shining, and a foray through Estes Park, a place my family visited years ago. Those adventures deepened our bond, and I proposed to her on a return trip to Colorado Springs.

Lou Snider, Jeanne Snider holding April Snider, and Mike Snider on a road trip. (Photo: Courtesy of Mike Snider)

We enjoyed our road trip so much that a few years ago, Julie and I flew to California and met my parents, who were traveling in their RV, for an expedition up the coast to Seattle where I celebrated my birthday in the Space Needle.

Julie won't be my traveling partner on this trip, but she will be a welcome sight at the end of the road.

HOUSTON  A naked woman who climbed on top of a tractor-trailer and slowed traffic on a Houston highway Monday will not face charges, authorities said.

On Monday, the woman took off her clothes, climbed on a truck and was twerking and gyrating for passing vehicles on US-290 for hours.

Once police officers got her down from the truck, she was taken to a hospital.

Deputies said the 25-year-old woman will move from a hospital to the Harris County Psychiatric Center.

Deputies believe a mental breakdown caused her to strip and dance on top of the truck during a two-hour standoff with police and firefighters.

Pearly Ward saw the whole thing unfold and called 911.

Thats the most horrific thing Ive ever seen, and Ill be 68 in two days, Ward said Monday.

The dancing womans mother recognized her on TV and also called authorities.

Brian Shirley, a volunteer firefighter, said it's a service call he will never forget.

Youre thinking on your feet the whole time, said Shirley. We wanted to get her down safely.

Shirley said the woman believed the FBI and CIA were coming after her.

Firefighters and police officers used ladder trucks to try to coax her down, but she cursed at them and refused to budge. They finally jumped on the top of the big rig cab and wrestled her into the ladder bucket.

Since the 16th century, Londons unassuming pubs have welcomed everyone from highwaymen and pirates to thinkers, artists and even royalty. As a community institution, the humble pub pervades every section of society. While the UKs total number of pubs continues to fall as people drink less, Londons pub scene is thriving. Quality rather than quantity now rules the day, and with the number of microbreweries ever increasing, beer lovers know more and expect more than ever before.

Craft beer has taken over the market in a very short period of time, explains Giuseppe Verdoni, director of the first Italian beer pub in London, The Italian Job. Traditional pubs are now serving at least one craft beer along with the usual lagers. With a high rate of failure of traditional pubs and a reducing alcohol consumption per capita, pubs need to reinvent themselves to survive. I believe that a focus on craft beers and on high quality products from wine to food are the winning factor for the success of the pub.

Editor of industry magazine, Pub & Bar, Tristan OHana agrees. The amount of microbreweries popping up across the capital means that you can get decent local beers in most places,"" he says. ""As I live in southeast London, Im usually on the lookout for beers from Brixton Brewery and Brick Brewery, but there hundreds to choose from all over London.

It's not just the booze that's getting better. British cuisine (much maligned in the past and to be fair probably quite wisely) has embraced its own history and that of the waves of different cultures that have become the building blocks of modern London. From food trucks parked in pub gardens to all local ingredient menus, pop ups to deconstructed classics, the term gastropub might get a bad rep but pub food has never been so diverse.

NFL free agents began switching teams at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, when their 2015 contracts officially expired and the new league year began. However agents have been negotiating with other clubs since the NFL's legal tampering period began Monday. Plenty has already happened with more yet to come. Here is what we know:

Come back for updates throughout the day:

MANZIEL STILL A BROWN: NFL Network reports that the Cleveland Browns will not cut Johnny Manziel until the end of the week, hoping they still might find a trade partner for the troubled quarterback.

SAINTS LAND FLEENER: A year after trading Jimmy Graham, the New Orleans Saints again have an impact tight end. They signed Coby Fleener, who caught at least 50 passes each of the past three seasons in Indianapolis, according to FOXSports' Mike Garafolo.

DeMARCO'S PRICE: The Philadelphia Eagles announced the terms of the DeMarco Murray trade with the Tennessee Titans, and it didn't amount to much: The teams only swapped fourth-round picks in the deal for the running back.

BEARS MAKE MOVES: In addition to bringing in LB Danny Trevathan from Denver, Chicago re-signed CB Tracy Porter for three years and signed former Cardinals T Bobby Massie for three years.

BROWNS LOSE ANOTHER OL: After Alex Mack left for the Falcons earlier in the day, Cleveland now must cope with the departure of RT Mitchell Schwartz, who tweeted that he is headed to the Kansas City Chiefs. A person close to the situation tells USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero that the Browns pulled an earlier offer to Schwartz. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

CHARGERS RELOAD: San Diego announced it has signed former Seahawks DT Brandon Mebane to a three-year deal. Also getting a three-year contract is S Dwight Lowery, who replaces Eric Weddle.

GIANTS LAND BIG FISH: The New York Giants made another big move Wednesday by landing DE Olivier Vernon, USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero confirmed. The deal is for $85 million over five years. General manager Jerry Reese and first-year coach Ben McAdoo were looking to bolster their pass rush, and Vernon was the best defensive end available entering the day.

ANDRE OUT IN INDY: Andre Johnson's stay with the Indianapolis Colts last just one season, as the team released the veteran wide receiver on Wednesday.

ANOTHER BLOW TO BRONCOS: Denver lost QB Brock Osweiler on Wednesday and is also saying goodbye to LB Danny Trevathan, who is rejoining former Broncos coach John Fox in Chicago, per multiple reports.

BROCK GETS RB HELP IN HOUSTON: In addition to adding QB Brock Osweiler, the Texans also are signing RB Lamar Miller to a four-year deal worth $26 million ($14 million guaranteed), per USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero. A potentially game-changing day in Houston.

FAMILIAR FACE IN ATLANTA: The Falcons' new backup quarterback is their old backup quarterback. Matt Schaub, who began his career as Michael Vick's understudy, has agreed to return as the No. 2 behind Matt Ryan.

OSWEILER LEAVING DENVER: According to multiple reports, including WUSA's Mike Klis, Brock Osweiler will sign with the Houston Texans. Per NFL Network, Osweiler's deal is for four years and $72 million. The Denver Broncos now have a major hole to fill at quarterback with his departure and the retirement of Peyton Manning. Denver drafts last (31st) in the first round. ESPN's Adam Schefter reports Robert Griffin III could be a consideration.

IVORY MONEY: Chris Ivory got $10 million fully guaranteed on his 5-year, $32 million deal with Jaguars, per USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero. Another $3 million available in incentives.

GRIMES CUT: The Miami Dolphins officially released Pro Bowl CB Brent Grimes, an expected to move.

RAMS APPARENTLY SECURE KEENUM: According to USA TODAY Sports Tom Pelissero, the Los Angelews Rams placed a first-round restricted free agent tender on QB Case Keenum, which means that if another team signs him, they will need to forfeit a first-round draft pick to L.A. With the Broncos having a clear need at quarterback, this protects a player that Rams coach Jeff Fisher has said will enter the offseason as the starter. Keenum played for Denver coach Gary Kubiak in Houston.

BENGALS KEEP LINEMAN: Veteran T Eric Winston has re-signed with Cincinnati, a one-year deal worth $1.09 million, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero.

EAGLES ADD EXPENSIVE GUARD: The Texans couldn't pay everyone. G Brandon Brooks has left Houston for a five-year, $40 million in Philadelphia, per NFL Network, as the Eagles' latest makeover continues.

FORTE TO JETS: According to multiple reports, RB Matt Forte will sign with the Jets, replacing departed Chris Ivory.

HARRISON STAYS IN N.Y.: But NT Damon Harrison is not re-signing with the Jets. He will switch MetLife locker rooms and bring his run-stuffing, double-team commanding talents to the Giants, according to NFL Network. His deal is for five years and $46.3 million ($24 million guaranteed).

MARVIN JONES' MONEY: Updating an earlier item, the Lions and WR Marvin Jones have agreed to a five-year, $40 million deal. He's not the second coming of Calvin Johnson, but Jones and Golden Tate give QB Matthew Stafford a solid receiving tandem.

DOUG MARTIN STAYS PUT: The Buccaneers have re-signed RB Doug Martin, according to USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes. Martin rushed for 1,402 yards in 2015, second only to Adrian Peterson, and earned all-pro honors. According to reports, Martin's deal is for five years and $35.75 million ($15 million guaranteed with an average of $7.25 million over the first three years). The deal could max out at $42.5 million.

GREEN FINDING GREEN IN PITTSBURGH: Per multiple reports TE Ladarius Green will sign with the Steelers, replacing retired Heath Miller. Green could be a nice downfield weapon for QB Ben Roethlisberger, but he isn't nearly as good an in-line blocker as Miller was. Green caught 37 passes last year while splitting time with Antonio Gates.

STEELERS KEEP GUARD: Ramon Foster re-signed for three years in Pittsburgh.

FALCONS LAND MACK: Matt Ryan should enjoy some better protection next year with the Falcons signing C Alex Mack, who opted out of his deal with the Browns early, apparently looking for a better chance to win (and probably even more money). Mack should be familiar with the Atlanta offense having already played for OC Kyle Shanahan in Cleveland. The Falcons have been looking for a long-term center since Todd McClure retired after the 2012 season. Mack's new contract is for five years.

MORE ON EAGLES-DOLPHINS DEAL: According to NFL Network, Philadelphia and Miami will swap first-round picks  the Eagles move up to No. 8, the Dolphins drop to 13th  as part of the trade sending LB Kiko Alonso and CB Byron Maxwell to South Florida.

TWO-WAY BATTLE FOR FORTE? NFL Network claims both the Jets and Dolphins are on the trail of former Bears RB Matt Forte. The Jets lost Chris Ivory to the Jaguars, and Miami is poised to say goodbye to Lamar Miller. Heading to South Beach would allow Forte to reunite with new Dolphins coach Adam Gase, his coordinator in Chicago last year.

McCLAIN STAYING IN DALLAS: Sports Trust Advisors tweeted that Cowboys MLB Rolando McClain is staying put. The deal is for one year at $5 million, per the Associated Press.

NEW-LOOK BROWNS O-LINE? According to ProFootballTalk, Cleveland has revoked an offer from RT Mitchell Schwartz. C Alex Mack is nearing an agreement to join the Falcons, per several reports.

GATES RE-SIGNS: TE Antonio Gates will stay with the Chargers after agreeing to a two-year deal worth $12 million, per ESPN. Gates, who has 104 career receiving TDs, needs eight more to pass Tony Gonzales as the all-time leader among tight ends.

VIKINGS GRAB BOONE: 49ers G Alex Boone will sign with Vikings to give them much needed help along the offensive line, USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero confirms. Boone's deal is four years, $26.8 million with $10 million fully guaranteed. Minnesota has also re-signed reserve DT Kenrick Ellis.

HASSELBECK RETIRES: Matt Hasselbeck has joined fellow 1998 draft alums Peyton Manning and Charles Woodson in retirement. He has already joined Woodson on ESPN's roster of NFL analysts.

McLEOD TO EAGLES: Ex-Rams safety Rodney McLeod will sign with the Eagles for 5 years, $37M with $17M in guarantees, USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero reports.

EAGLES TO SIGN QB: Chase Daniel will follow Doug Pederson to Philly, after all. Multiple reports say the Eagles will sign the Chiefs back-up QB to a 2-year deal.

BENJAMIN BOLTS TO BOLTS: Deep threat WR Travis Benjamin, who also excels on returns, is headed to the San Diego Chargers, according to ESPN. He caught 68 passes for 966 yards for the Browns in 2015.

TOLBERT TO STAY IN CAROLINA: FB Mike Tolbert will sign a two-year deal, according to Fox Sports.

BENGALS DEAL OFFICIAL: USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero confirms Bengals will keep S George Iloka. Contract numbers: 5 years for $30M; $18M in first three years.

EAGLES-DOLPHINS DEAL OK: After some early reports the trade of CB Byron Maxwell to the Dolphins was in trouble because of Maxwell's health, USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero has confirmed the trade will go through that will send Maxwell and LB Kiko Alonso to Miami for draft picks.

ILOKA, BENGALS: CLOSE: The Bengals are closing on a five-year deal worth about $30 million with S George Iloka, according to NFL Network.

THE IRVIN CONTRACT: Bruce Irvin is getting top-10 linebacker money to join the Oakland Raiders. The deal Irvin agreed to late Tuesday is for four years and $37 million, including $12.5 million in the first year, according to details obtained by USA TODAY Sports.' Tom Pelissero. The deal maxes out at $39 million if Irvin hits Pro Bowl incentives each year. Irvin, 28, also was believed to have strong interest from the Arizona Cardinals, who faced him twice a year in the NFC West with the Seattle Seahawks since he entered the league in 2012. He has 22 sacks in four seasons. Its the second splash in advance of the 4 p.m. Wednesday launch of the league year by the Raiders, who also have agreed to a five-year, $58.5 million deal with former Baltimore Raven Kelechi Osemele that makes him by far the NFLs highest-paid guard.

JACKSON'S GUARANTEE: Malik Jacksons six-year, $85.5 million megadeal with the Jacksonville Jaguars starts out as a two-year, $31.5 million pact. According to contract details obtained by USA TODAY Sports, Jackson received a $10 million signing bonus and has fully guaranteed base salaries of $8 million in 2016 and $13.5 million in 2017. The trigger for the rest of the deal is a $10.5 million portion of his $13.5 million salary in 2018  guaranteed for injury only at signing  that would become fully guaranteed of the fifth day of the 2018 league year. So, the Jaguars will have a choice at that point on whether the former Denver Broncos defensive end is worth the investment. The rest of Jacksons deal is non-guaranteed base salaries -- $13 million in 2019, $13.75 million in 2020 and $13.75 million in 2021  with $1.5 million in escalators each of those last three years to reach the maximum value of $90 million. At any rate, its a big-time money for Jackson, whose two-year average ($15.75M) or full six-year average ($14.25M) makes him one of the NFLs two or three highest-paid defensive ends.

LIONS TO LAND WR JONES: Cincinnati Bengals receiver Marvin Jones will sign with the Lions once free agency opens at 4 p.m. today, according to ESPN . Jones was seeking a contract in the neighborhood of $8 million per season. The story from the Detroit Free-Press.

DOLPHINS PULL TAG ON VERNON: Miami has pulled the transition tag from Olivier Vernon. He will be available to teams when free agency starts. This allows the Dolphins to receive compensatory picks if he signs elsewhere.

GIANTS TO LAND TOP CB: The New York Giants are expected to sign Los Angeles Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins when the new league year begins Wednesday afternoon, according to a published report. Jenkins, one of the most sought-after defensive backs set to his free agency, was not franchise tagged by the Rams last week, designation that instead went to fellow defensive back Trumaine Johnson. The NFL Network was the first to report that Jenkins was on the move. Jenkins, taken in the second round out of North Alabama by the Rams in the 2012 NFL draft, had 10 interceptions --- half returned for touchdowns --- in his four-season run with the franchise.

EAGLES-DOLPHINS TRADE IN TROUBLE?: The deal sending CB Byron Maxwell and LB Kiko Alonso might be in trouble. Several reports say the Dolphins have issues with Maxwell's physical.

THE TOP FREE AGENTS:

1. CB Sean Smith: Coming off a strong season for the Kansas City Chiefs, a 6-3, 218-pounder who can press at the line should be in high demand in a league increasingly populated by oversized wideouts.

2. T Russell Okung: He never developed into the next Walter Jones for the Seattle Seahawks  an unfair comparison by definition  and required shoulder surgery after dislocating it in the playoffs. Still, solid left tackles will always find work in the NFL.

3. QB Ryan Fitzpatrick: Though he hasn't been to the playoffs in 11 seasons, he's narrowly missed the past two years with the Texans and Jets and seems to be getting incrementally better with age. Fitzpatrick could be the best short-term fallback for teams that lose out in the Osweiler sweepstakes or arent in position to draft a perceived franchise quarterback.

4. S Eric Weddle: An all-pro in 2014, he slumped last year while dealing with injuries and what seemed like season-long divorce proceedings from the San Diego Chargers. Still, Weddle is an accomplished veteran at another position that could be tough to fill via free agency or the draft.

5. DT Nick Fairley: Theres little question about his talent, though hes certainly looked even better while playing on star-studded lines for the Lions and Rams and has had some off-field issues.

Already agreed to contracts: TE Coby Fleener (Saints), RB Matt Forte (Jets), NT Damon Harrison (Giants), LB Bruce Irvin (Raiders), RB Chris Ivory(Jaguars), DE Malik Jackson (Jaguars), CB Janoris Jenkins (Giants), WR Marvin Jones (Lions), C Alex Mack (Falcons), RB Doug Martin (Buccaneers), RB Lamar Miller (Texans), OL Kelechi Osemele (Raiders), QB Brock Osweiler (Texans), DE Jason Pierre-Paul (Giants), T Mitchell Schwartz (Chiefs), LB Danny Trevathan (Bears), Mario Williams (Dolphins)",[]

Chicago filmmaker Andy Wachowski, one half of the powerhouse duo formerly known as The Wachowski Brothers, has come out as transgender after being ambushed at her home by a Daily Mail reporter. But instead of giving her story to the U.K. publication, Lilly reached out to LGBTQ publication the Windy City News to give a statement.

Her sister, Lana Wachowski, born Laurence Wachowski, came out as transgender years earlier.

Theyre best known for movies like The Matrix trilogy and Cloud Atlas with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.

In the statement to Windy City, Lilly Wachowski chose the headline:

SEX CHANGE SHOCKERWACHOWSKI BROTHERS NOW SISTERS!!!

She said in part: My sister Lana and I have largely avoided the press. I find talking about my art frustratingly tedious and talking about myself a wholly mortifying experience. I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly. You know, when youre living as an out transgender person its ... kind of difficult to hide. I just wantedneeded some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. ... But apparently I dont get to decide this.

She also said that being transgender is not easy. We live in a majority-enforced gender binary world. This means when youre transgender you have to face the hard reality of living the rest of your life in a world that is openly hostile to you. ... I am one of the lucky ones. Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process.

Nick Adams, GLAADs Director of Programs for Transgender Media, released a statement that said, GLAAD is thrilled that Lilly Wachowski is able to be her true and authentic self today, however, she should not have been forced to disclose her transgender identity before she was ready to do so. Journalists must learn that it is unacceptable to out a transgender person, in the same way it is unacceptable to out a person who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

GLADD also released a tip sheet for transgender terminology, and its worth a read.

In a statement to USA TODAY College, a DailyMail.com spokesman says the website categorically denies that it in any way tried to coerce Lily Wachowski into revealing her gender transition. We made absolutely clear at several points in the conversation that we were only interested in reporting the story if and when she was happy for us to do so and with her cooperation.",[]

(Photo: Julie Jacobson, AP)

WASHINGTON  The federal government is proposing to restore $1.7 million a year in fines against airlines that bring travelers to the U.S. without current passports and visas.

A 1996 regulation was overturned in 2009 by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals because the State Department and former Immigration and Naturalization Service didnt work together on it.

But State and Customs and Border Protection jointly proposed Tuesday to overhaul the regulation to fine airlines up to $4,300 for each traveler who arrives without proper documentation because the rules have become inconsistent in the last two decades.

CBP can waive the requirement for documents in an unforeseen emergency. But even if the document requirement is waived, CBP said fines against airlines could total $1.7 million per year for 950 violations, based on the average number of cases during the past five years, if the proposed regulation is adopted.

The objective of this regulation is to allow CBP to waive the requirement of proper entry documents for non-immigrants in an unforeseen emergency while still retaining the ability to fine the carrier for transporting an alien to the United States without proper entry documentation, Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland secretary, said in the 24-page proposal.

Airlines have fought the fines in federal court in the past, but said they comply with federal regulations.

""We are reviewing the rule,"" said Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group representing most of the largest carriers. ""It is important to note that all A4A members comply with federal regulations to ensure that passengers arriving into and departing from the United States are properly documented.""

A dozen airlines challenged the initial regulation, when fines were set before inflation at $3,000 for each traveler, in at least three federal cases.

United Airlines, for example, flew a Mongolian citizen to Canada in 1994, with a connection in the U.S. The traveler wasnt technically allowed to enter the U.S., but was given a so-called ""parole,"" which is granted for humanitarian reasons or other significant public benefit, so he could continue his journey to Montreal while INS fined United.

United argued that it was unfair to fine the airline if the traveler was paroled rather than given a waiver to the requirement for documents.

The appeals-court decision allowed fines when waivers are denied. But the ruling didnt allow fines when travelers denied waivers are nevertheless allowed into the country under parole.

This has led to a situation where carriers are being penalized inconsistently when they transport aliens to the United States without proper identification, Johnson said in the proposal.

CBP and State will collect public comment on the latest joint proposal until May 9.

An electrical transmission substation in Westerville, Ohio, in 2015. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP)

Could it be lights out for America? Thats something that people are starting to worry about, and these worries arent coming solely from the usual crowd of survivalists and preppers. Shut down the computers that run the power plants and distribution systems and you shut down America. Thats looking more possible, lately.

One of those worrying is former ABC News anchor Ted Koppel, whose new book, Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath , looks at the danger of losing electrical power due to a cyberattack. The picture Koppel paints isnt a pretty one: Cities, unpowered for weeks and months, could become largely uninhabitable.

But, says Koppel, nobody is thinking about this very clearly: It would be comforting to report that those agencies charged with responding to disaster are adequately prepared to deal with the consequences of a cyberattack on the grid. They are not.

In fact, he writes, they cant even agree on whats involved: The deputy administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) believes that a major urban center would have to be evacuated. His boss, the administrator, does not. The administrator believes that a successful cyberattack on a power grid is possible, even likely. His deputy does not. The current secretary of homeland security is sure that a plan to deal with the aftermath of a cyberattack on the grid exists, but he doesnt know any details of the plan. As of this writing, there is no specific plan.

Well, thats comforting, though not especially surprising: If the government flubs its response to natural disasters like Katrina or Sandy, when storms are a regular occurrence, how likely is it to deal well with something that hasnt happened to the United States before?

Nor is a cyber-attack on the power grid just a fantasy. In fact, in Ukraine (which I fear is a laboratory for new warfare techniques the way Spain was in the 1930s), its already happened.

As Wired magazine recently reported, someone  most likely someone Russian  shut down Ukraines power grid with a hack attack that sounds like something out of a thriller movie: Inside the Prykarpattyaoblenergo control center, which distributes power to the regions residents, operators too were nearing the end of their shift. But just as one worker was organizing papers at his desk that day, the cursor on his computer suddenly skittered across the screen of its own accord. He watched as it navigated purposefully toward buttons controlling the circuit breakers at a substation in the region and then clicked on a box to open the breakers and take the substation offline. A dialogue window popped up on screen asking to confirm the action, and the operator stared dumbfounded as the cursor glided to the box and clicked to affirm. Somewhere in a region outside the city he knew that thousands of residents had just lost their lights and heaters.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

The hackers didnt just turn things off  they overwrote firmware on critical devices, making it impossible for operators to control them from control centers. And, lest Americans think that our system is less vulnerable, the Ukrainian control systems were actually quite secure, separated from the regular Internet and protected by robust security systems. American networks are, in some ways, more vulnerable.

Even so, the Ukrainian attack wasnt as bad as it could have been  the attackers didnt use techniques that would have allowed them to physically wreck generators and other important equipment. It seems to have been meant as a warning.

But will we take it as one? We should. Though the American power grid is reliable and well-designed, it wasnt constructed with cyberattacks in mind.

We could protect against cyberattacks completely, of course, by simply taking computers out of the grid and controlling things manually. This is undoubtedly possible since we ran electrical networks before computers existed, but it would be costly and inefficient. And while that approach would protect against cyber attacks, it wouldnt do much to insulate the grid from other threats, like electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks and solar flares that are also causes of concern.

Apparently, the White House is finally beginning to address the problem, but were years behind the curve. At the very least, we should have backup plans for restoring power if things go wrong. And beyond that, we should be designing networks that are more resistant to cyber sabotage. Because the world is unlikely to become a safer place anytime soon.

It's official: Hard rock band KISS will be heading to sea again with fans later this year.

Music cruise organizer Sixthman says its sixth KISS sailing, dubbed The KISS Kruise VI: Creatures of the Deep, will kick off Nov. 4 in Miami on Norwegian Cruise Line's 2,394-passenger Norwegian Pearl.

Themed around KISS' quintessential Creatures of the Night tour of 1982, the five-night voyage will feature the band playing tracks from the tour and wearing vintage costumes that evoke the era.

As with past KISS cruises, the sailing also will offer participatory activities including a photo session with the band and theme nights, and there will be performances by additional artists.

The Western Caribbean itinerary will include stops in Cozumel, Mexico and Grand Cayman.

Fares for the trip start at $1,120 per person, based on double occupancy and not including $275 in taxes and fees. Lower rates are available for groups of three to five passengers sharing a cabin. More information is online at thekisskruise.com.

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Transgender Americans deserve protection,"['Est March', 'Eric Anthony Grollman', 'P M']","It's not just about bathrooms. Discrimination can lead to unemployment, poverty and even murder.

Demonstrators in Pierre, S.D., in February 2016. (Photo: Jay Pickthorn, (Sioux Falls, S.D.) Argus Leader, via AP)

The South Dakota legislatures failure to override a gubernatorial veto killed, once and for all, a bill that would have banned transgender students from using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. This hot-button political issue is cropping up in states and workplaces all over the country, a symptom of broader and sometimes more dangerous discrimination against a minority that only recently started making its voice heard.

Just last month, a transgender woman named Georgia Carter was hired at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Richmond, Va., only to be denied the job an hour later because the manager was unsure which restroom she would use at work. The manager was fired a few days later for violating KFCs nondiscrimination policy, which includes gender identity and expression.

The politics of peeing, or being denied access to the sex-segregated restroom that corresponds to ones gender identity, is just one of the many types of discrimination experienced by the approximately 700,000 Americans who identify as transgender. Last year, a record number of transgender people were murdered, almost all of them trans women of color. At least 23 trans people were killed last year in the United States and at least 81 were killed worldwide.

Monica Loera, a 43-year-old Latina trans woman in Texas, became the first reported transgender person murdered in 2016, shot and killed outside of her Austin home in late January. One month later came the murder of two black trans women, Veronica Banks Cano in San Antonio and Maya Young in Philadelphia. Less than three months into 2016, the year is already off to a grim start for transgender Americans.

Research on violence and discrimination against transgender people provides evidence that these stories are not isolated incidents. Lisa R. Miller and I recently published an article in Sociological Forum about transgender Americans experiences of transphobic (i.e., anti-transgender) discrimination. Our analysis was based on the first-of-its-kind National Transgender Discrimination Survey, which included data from over 6,400 trans respondents. The results offer a bleak picture of the way transgender people are treated in the United States.

We found that 70% of trans people reported experiencing major events of discrimination, such as unfairly being denied a job, having to hide that they are transgender at work in order to keep their jobs or being denied medical care because of ones gender identity. In addition, 70% reported facing more subtle, everyday forms of discrimination, like harassment at work, being referred to with the wrong pronoun or having private information shared without their consent. Discrimination against trans people is widespread, occurring at work, hospitals, restaurants and stores, hotels, courtrooms, in interactions with the police, at airports, and on buses and trains.

Such discrimination has consequences that range from minor discomfort or inconvenience to unemployment, poverty and wrongful incarceration. My co-author and I also found that these experiences compromise the health of transgender people. Trans people who experience discrimination are more likely to smoke cigarettes, use drugs and alcohol, and attempt suicide.

We found that the more frequently trans people are recognized by others as transgender, the more discrimination they face  and, the more discrimination trans people face, the more likely they are to smoke, drink or use drugs, and to have attempted suicide. The message from our transphobic society is that transgender people should hide, blend in, or convert. The nation offered former Olympian and television star Caitlyn Jenner a warm welcome when she publicly announced that she is a trans woman. But for the majority, the everyday reality of being transgender in America is filled with discrimination and violence that seem like punishment for being different.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Most Americans tend to conflate sex (the gender a person is assigned at birth) with gender identity (which is based on internal sense of self). They often struggle to understand how someone who looks like one sex would identify as the other, and even in some cases transition surgically from one sex to another.

This helps explain some of the intense resistance to transgender people and their rising activism. Backlash is fairly common when minority groups become more visible, more vocal and more powerful, especially if they are not well understood. We are perhaps witnessing that in America right now  for example, a spike in hate-motivated violence against trans people, discrimination in the workplace and a slew of proposed state and local laws to ban trans people from using the bathroom appropriate for their gender.

This is unacceptable. As a nation, more and more of us have come to recognize and oppose discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, socioeconomic status or age. It is time to raise the countrys consciousness on gender identity and expression and add them to the list of protected categories. We should be protecting transgender Americans from discrimination  not perpetuating and expanding it.

In this, the eighth of our new series of Cruise Ship Smackdowns, we're pitting Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Magic against Princess Cruises' Royal Princess. Click through the carousels above and below and then go to the comment area to tell us: Which ship would you book, and why?

Unveiled in May 2011 and June 2013, respectively, both of these ships are among the largest at sea and boast all the trappings of a major megaresort, including deck-top fun zones and multiple restaurants, bars and nightclubs. However, as you can see from the photo tours, each ship boasts its own unique, distinctive vibe.

Currently sailing out of Galveston, Texas (though that will change in May when it moves to Port Canaveral, Fla.), Carnival Cruise Line's 3,690-passenger Carnival Magic continues Carnival's famous ""fun ship"" focus. The vessel features its own massive water park area with multiple slides including one that's 312 feet long; a suspended-in-the-sky ropes course; and an outdoor weightlifting area. It also offers multiple restaurants, bars and nightclubs; a large spa; and an adults-only outdoor relaxation zone.

Sailing in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, the 3,560-passenger Royal Princess is home to a cantilevered, glass-enclosed walkway over the ocean called the SeaWalk; an expanded pool deck that transforms at night into a stage for an elaborate water and light show; and a working television studio/performance venue that seats 280 people. The ship also has a greatly expanded version of the line's signature Piazza, a central atrium area with food outlets and entertainment.",[]

SEOUL, South Korea - Googles computer program AlphaGo defeated its human opponent, Lee Sedol, in the first game of their highly anticipated five-game match.

Wednesdays victory by AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence program developed by Google DeepMind, over South Korean Go champion Lee is significant because the ancient Chinese board game, one of the most creative and complex games ever devised, was difficult for computers to master.

The near-infinite number of board positions in Go requires players to rely on intuition in making their moves. AlphaGo was designed to mimic that intuition in tackling complex tasks.

AI experts had forecast it would take another decade for computers to beat professional Go players until AlphaGo beat a European Go champion last year.

The remaining four more matches will end on Tuesday.

SAN FRANCISCO - Google's autonomous cars have been programmed to make a wide variety of human-like driving maneuvers over 1.4 million miles of road testing.

But apparently ""punching the gas"" isn't one of them.

A video posted online Wednesday by the Associated Press that is attributed to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority shows the moment that a Google-owned self-driving Lexus SUV attempts a slow-speed merge into a lane with an oncoming municipal bus.

Where a human would have likely read the fairly large gap between the two vehicles as an invitation to scoot into position with the quick tap on the throttle, the Google car, which isn't know for abrupt actions, plodded along at 2 mph into a bus traveling at 15 mph. There was damage to the Lexus left front quarter panel, but no injuries.

The incident, which took place Feb. 14, was reported to the California Department of Motor Vehicles by Google, and represents the first time in more than a dozen reported accidents that Google's vehicle was at fault. In this instance, the Lexus moved slightly out of its lane because its various radar and laser sensors detected sand bags in its path.

As the bus driver POV camera footage shows, the driver proceeded on his route assuming the Google car would bow to his vehicle's sheer mass. As Google noted in its month online report about its project, ""our test driver, who had been watching the bus in the mirror, also expected the bus to slow or stop. And we can imagine the bus driver assumed we were going to stay put. Unfortunately, all these assumptions led us to the same spot in the lane at the same time.""

Cars that partially drive themselves are already here, and Google's self-driving car lead Chris Urmson has targeted 2020 as a realistic date for getting a consumer-friendly autonomous car on the road. While detractors question a machine's ability to read for all situations (of which this incident is a prime example), Google argues that overall the number of accidents and fatalities will be far lower with computers at the wheel.

Only the first few seconds of the 1 minute and 39 second video shows the collision clearly. The rest of the footage offers vantages from other cameras on the bus, including shots of a clearly puzzled driver who stops to let off his annoyed passengers.

However, another form of distraction may be coming right up those cables, and for some, it may be time to face the music  or more specifically, the lyrics.

Music with lyrics is very likely to have a problematic effect when youre writing or reading, said Clifford Nass, professor at Stanford University. Probably less of an effect on math, if youre not using the language parts of your brain.

Music has a profound impact on our state of being, altering everything from mood to heart rate. It can energize or depress us. Medium levels of arousal are ideal for studying  not too agitated and not too relaxed  and music can also be an effective tool in leading students to that level.

Imagine trying to learn something while youre on a roller coaster, Nass said. If youre feeling agitated, you can listen to more calming music, and that will absolutely have a positive effect.

Glenn Schellenberg, a professor in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, published a study that indicates fast, loud background music hinders reading comprehension.

The reason why its a mess is you have cognitive limitations. If youre doing two things at once you dont focus as well, he said. On the other hand, we know that music changes how you feel, and often it can change how you feel in a positive way.

In other words, it seems carefully tailoring the music you listen to while studying, based on the subject matter and your mood, can help keep you focused  so long as you stay away from lyrics while doing language-based work.

Music has always had its place at college, but as it has become more portable and high quality, it is reaching areas where it never used to take up residence.

In my day, there was no way you could take music to the library, Nass said. When [todays students] go to the library to study, they bring their noise, and music, with them.

In any case, music is very likely better than Facebook and Twitter, and in a world where multitasking has become extremely common because everything is on one device, some students find music helps keep them focused while studying.

Especially when music doesnt have words, it can help me get into the reading and stop me getting distracted by other things, said Melanie Fineman, a junior at Brown University. It makes studying more enjoyable.

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Making mass transit work for travelers,"['Est March', 'Christopher Elliott', 'Special For Usa Today', 'P M']","For some travelers, the thought of using mass transit can be a little daunting. But choosing a train over a car can save you big bucks. So how can you overcome your mass transit phobia? VPC

The Metro in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Just the mention of mass transit is enough to either send you to the next paragraph  or to click away. Yep, it's that divisive.

""Mass transit can be a surprisingly contentious topic for Americans,"" says Jon Tarleton, the head of transportation marketing at Finnish company Vaisala.

On one side, there's a small but growing group of devoted passengers who love the perks of riding the train or bus, including saving money and avoiding traffic. On the other, there's a far larger set of travelers who would rather stay home than give up the freedom of their own vehicle.

A majority of Americans drive to work in their own car. Only 21% take a bus, followed by subway (9%) and train (8%), according to a recent survey by Citi ThankYou Premier. Transit commuters take an average of 45 minutes and spend approximately $10 per day getting to work.

The riders have a lot going for them. The train often costs less, is more practical and it's great for the environment. Drivers make equally valid points about flexibility and convenience. Sometimes the math works in their favor, too.

People who ride mass transit save on average a whopping $771 per month over car ownership, according to a recent survey by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), a trade group (see below). Although they don't have related numbers for leisure travel, it's a safe bet that at least as many people drive when traveling for leisure, if not more.

But I felt torn the last time I visited Washington with my family. I found a Blue Line Metro station two short blocks away from where we were staying, but the math and the train schedules didn't align for my family of five. Instead, we fought traffic in our SUV and paid for parking.

Renee Flowers, who was raised in D.C. and rode the Metro as a child, also wanted to do so as an adult, but she says ""parking became impossible at the stations in the suburbs, and the trains became so unreliable that I decided to drive."" The decision lengthened each workday by three hours, says Flowers, who now works for a hospitality marketing company in Charleston, S.C.

Even in places where it makes a lot of sense to take the train, travelers tell me they'd rather not. ""If I can, I drive into New York,"" admits Nancy Hassel, who runs a membership organization in Babylon, N.Y. ""Is there traffic to get there? Yes, but not always  and most times it is just in the same congested places you can expect. But I am in my own car, not depending on if the train is late, or if there are electrical problems.""

I suspect most Americans feel a lot like Wayne Schoeneberg, which is to say, they'd use more mass transit if they could.

""When I go to cities that have it, I use it as my primary means of transportation  places like New York, Paris or London,"" says Schoeneberg, a life coach. ""Sadly, I live in St. Louis, where mass transit is an afterthought. Trains in the Midwest are abysmal. The routes, schedules and service are all sub-par.""

Michael Brein doesn't buy our excuses. He's the author of a series of guidebooks that advise tourists how to use mass transit, and before he started writing them, he heard all the reasons why we don't ride, including mine about the math. His favorite one? When he was researching the edition on Los Angeles, the naysayers said the city was just too spread out and that visiting without a car ""couldn't be done.""

""Turns out that in a huge, sprawling metropolis such as L.A., you can easily and comfortably get to the top 50 visitor attractions using L.A.'s Red Line subway as well as the other color light rail lines and express buses,"" Brein says. ""There is no cheaper way.""

The conflict between drivers and riders exists because the solution isn't easy. But here it is, nonetheless: Our buses, trains and subways will never be first rate until they become a priority, and they won't become a priority until we stop making excuses. It could take a generation or more, but as Simon Tam, who works for the nonprofit Oregon Environmental Council, notes, it is happening.



""A new generation of Americans is slowly shifting their opinions,"" he says.

OK  I'm ready to give the Blue Line one more try.

How to overcome mass-transit phobia

 Do your homework. The first step is always the hardest. ""To figure out how and where to take a bus or train, just go to the public transit systems website,"" advises Michael Melaniphy, APTA's president. ""Look for a section on trip planning, schedules and fares. I think you will be surprised how much information is available and how it can be personalized for your travel needs.""



 Consider the benefits. Using public transportation means you have more time to do things you enjoy. Instead of being stuck in a traffic jam, you can read a book, text or email. Plus, there's often no better way of seeing a new city.



 Download an app. New apps such as Moovit (moovitapp.com) have demystified the ridership experience. They let you know the precise location of the train station or bus stop and can even tell you when the next subway is scheduled to arrive. No more guessing.

How much would you save by taking the train?

People who ride public transportation instead of driving can save, on average, more than $771 per month.

NEW YORK (AP)  Chobani plans to expand beyond its Greek yogurt cups this summer as it faces intensifying competition in the fast growing category.

Starting in July, the company plans to offer Chobani Oats, which is yogurt mixed with fruit and oats; a dessert called Chobani Indulgent and new flavors for kids.

Later this year, the Norwich, N.Y.-based company will also introduce savory dips, Chief Marketing Officer Peter McGuinness said in a phone interview. Chobani has been testing such offerings at its cafe in New York City's SoHo neighborhood.

The privately held company has grown quickly over the last several years, riding the surge in popularity of Greek yogurt, and is the biggest seller of Greek yogurt in the U.S. But competition has been increasing, with General Mills and Danone investing more heavily in their Greek yogurt brands. Whole Foods recently decided to stop carrying Chobani to make room for other Greek yogurt alternatives.

McGuinness said Chobani Oats will be company's first product specifically designed to compete in the breakfast category. He said it will be positioned to compete with ""bars, cereal and oatmeal"" rather than other yogurts. Although the oats will be mixed into the yogurt, he said they will be ""al dente"" and not ""mushy."" The cups will cost slightly more than its core yogurt cups at between $1.20 and $1.50.

As for the company's plans to raise capital to fund its expansion, he said executives are ""still in discussions.""

An undated image made from video of Leigh Anne Arthur in Union County, S.C. (Photo: WYFF (Greenville, S.C.) News-4, via AP)

When we were kids, the teachers desk was a fearsome island, a place you didnt approach unless you absolutely had to.

Clearly, things have changed.

Take what happened when a South Carolina high school teacher left her cell phone on her desk last week to, she says, do her hall monitoring duties for a few minutes.

That phone was swiped by a 16-year-old male student, who then opened her photo library, went through the teachers photos, found a picture of her nude that she had taken for her husband (as she would later freely admit) for Valentines Day. The student took a snapshot of that photo with his phone, then sent it around to anyone and everyone he chose.

According to the teacher in an interview with a South Carolina CBS affiliate, that student later told her, Your day of reckoning is coming.

Now, I would like to state, proudly, how old I am. I am old enough that 1) If I took something from my teachers desk 2) If I dared to leaf through it 3) If I ever uttered the words, Your day of reckoning is coming to ANY ADULT IN THE WORLD  my day of reckoning would have already arrived.

I would have been thrown out of school, no questions asked, which would not have mattered, since my parents would have grounded me for life.

Instead, last week, the only day of reckoning was for the teacher, a 13-year veteran named Leigh Anne Arthur. Thanks to this kids antics, she was pressured to resign, she said.

And, until Friday, after the public outcry had grown loud, the student had not been punished or charged.

Like I said, things have changed.

Wrong person being blamed

The interim superintendent of the Union County School District, David Eubanks, seemed to blame Arthur, the teacher, far more than he blamed the student. He called the photo inappropriate material, claimed she wasnt where she was supposed to be during the four-minute break between classes and criticized her for not having the phone locked with a passcode.

Wow. And if someone leaves keys in a car, is it all clear for his students to go joyriding? I have read this story a hundred times and for the life of me cant figure out what has happened to common sense and ethics.

While I might not applaud a teacher taking a nude selfie for her husband, thats not my business. There is still no denying the student took her phone. No denying he went through her photos. No denying he took a picture of her racy but private image. No denying he sent it to others.

But SHE is out?

Yep. Not only that. But the superintendent actually suggested to a news outlet that Arthur, 33, may have been guilty of corrupting a minor.

Let me break some news to the man: if a 16-year-old knows how to that rapidly find someone elses photos on someone elses phone, Im pretty sure he has found access to a lot worse.

Finally, on Friday, the teen was charged with violating the states computer crime act and aggravated voyeurism. Youd think, if authorities came to that conclusion in less than a week, the school might have seen it coming and not acted as if this was so completely the teachers fault.

Instead, you have the superintendents statement to the media: One error ... by a teacher, has and will affect the lives of many.

A teacher error? Thats how you sum it up?

Common sense overlooked

But this is the age we live in, when schools are more worried about lawsuits and political correctness than teaching things that truly matter. Like privacy, or respecting others dignity, or, failing that, their property.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Late last week, a group of students started a petition to get Arthurs job back, claiming she was a fine teacher (she taught mechatronics  mechanical and electrical engineering and computer programming) and that she was a victim of a blatant attack on her privacy.

This proves that certain South Carolina kids are already smarter than the school thats trying to teach them.

Arthur, for her part, isnt sure she wants to come back. She claims she has already received reprints of her personal photos in her home mailbox with a threatening note.

And then there are her bosses, including the tone-deaf superintendent who is still arguing that she let students use her phone before  as if that excuses stealing private photos and sending them to the world.

Amazingly, Arthur herself has already forgiven the student who violated so many things we never would have considered in the old days, when a teachers desk was No Mans Land.

Hes 16, she told an NBC affiliate. Hes going to make stupid decisions. We all made stupid decisions at 16.

Some, like this school system, havent stopped.

Iranians vote in Tehran on Feb. 29, 2016. (Photo: Vahid Salemi, AP)

Iran has plagued six presidents since revolutionaries overran the U.S. Embassy and took Americans hostage in Tehran in 1979, and it will be one of the hardest diplomatic challenges for the next president as well. The nation is a regional troublemaker, the sworn enemy of U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a key backer of Syrias Bashar Assad.

A year or even six months ago, there was real fear that Iran's determination to build nuclear weapons would erupt into war. If the prospect of Americas third attack on a Muslim country in the Middle East was nightmarish, so too was the prospect that a country as mercurial and hostile as Iran was on the cusp of having the bomb.

That war didnt happen is a tribute to cooler heads on both sides, and its the right context for thinking about the entire bumpy road to whatever new relationship the U.S. and Iran are working out. As bad as things are, they could be a lot worse.

Thats also the appropriate perspective for assessing Iran's recent elections. They didnt change the fundamental nature of the countrys leadership or Irans determination to direct events in its neighborhood. Nor did the elections suddenly transform Irans repressive internal politics. Hard-liners still control the military, the courts and key sectors of the economy.

Even so  and this is the good news  the election was another modest step in the right direction for moderates, who gained scores of new seats in Irans parliament. Two particularly hard-line members of the Assembly of Experts, the body that will someday pick the next supreme leader, were voted out of office.

Moderate is, of course, a relative term in Iranian politics, where many reformers are dead, imprisoned,exiled or simply barred from running for office. Compared with hard-line former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who denied the Holocaust and bitterly opposed the West, President Hassan Rouhani and his allies are an improvement.

Although critics have mocked the elections as nothing to celebrate, imagine if the results had gone the other way, producing more hard-liners and more refusal to engage with the West or stick to the nuclear agreement. Instead, the results were fairly seen as support by Iranian voters for the weapons deal, which traded away for at least a decade the plans to build a bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

Into this fragile, complicated situation step the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Ted Cruz vows to rip the Iran nuclear accord to shreds on his first day in the Oval Office. Donald Trump says that if hes president, hell renegotiate the insane bargain that was worked out by stupid, incompetent people in the Obama administration.

Cruzs tough talk about tearing up the deal wouldnt just signal that the U.S. cant be trusted to stand by its word from one administration to the next; it ignores the fact that the accord wasnt made only by the U.S. but also by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China  all of which helped apply the tough sanctions that finally brought Iran to the table. Trumps blithe claim that he could get a better deal probably either amuses or alarms those other countries, which have said that they wont restart talks if the U.S. unilaterally backs out of the agreement.

For its part, Iran has been as good as its word. It shipped 98% of its enriched uranium out of the country, mothballed most of its centrifuges and poured cement into the core of a reactor that could have created bomb-making plutonium. None of this means Iran is turning into a responsible actor on the world stage, but U.S. voters should beware of candidates who'd renege on American commitments and offer simplistic approaches to complex problems.

Construction equipment is strewn about the hills that sweep across Jack Daniels sprawling southern Tennessee distillery property  a small price to pay for a resurgence of the American whiskey industry.

The machinery, siding and temporary fencing on the otherwise bucolic landscape are a byproduct of a new $140 million expansion project that, the company announced last month, is needed to keep up with increased demand for one of Tennessees most iconic products.

U.S. whiskey sales are on a five-year upswing, with supplier revenues rising 8 percent  roughly double the 4.1 percent growth in the overall distilled spirits sector  last year alone to eclipse $8 billion, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS).

Whiskeys comeback comes, in part, at the expense of the fading vodka industry, which has seen sales slow after exploding in the 1980s and 1990s. Although vodka remains the top-selling spirit by volume, revenue inched up only 0.5 percent last year.

Instead, drinkers are increasingly choosing whiskey  particularly American styles, including bourbon, rye and Tennessee whiskey, said David Ozgo, chief economist for DISCUS. Distillers sold more than 20 million cases of American whiskeys in 2015.

Were really entering a period of whiskey nirvana. The consumer just has an incredible fascination with the product, and the marketplace is responding with a variety of well-crafted, easy-to-drink products, Ozgo said.

Tennessee whiskey, defined by state law and bound by a rigid distilling process, remains one of the states top exports and is increasing its overall market share. Supplier sales rose by 7.4 percent last year, compared with the 5.2 percent growth in the broader American whiskey category.

That demand, coupled with loosened restrictions on where distillers can operate in the state, is giving way to a new crop of whiskey-makers working to pack store shelves with a host of new brands. Once dominated by big producers Jack Daniels and George Dickel, there are now 30-plus distillers in the state.

Whiskey is in somewhat of a renaissance, said Jeff Arnett, Jack Daniels master distiller. There are more people drinking and looking at whiskeys than there ever have been.

Nashville's whiskey scene

Nashville brothers Charlie and Andy Nelson are among a new generation of area distillers looking to get in on Tennessee whiskey's renewed popularity, deciding back in 2006 to resurrect their great-great-great-grandfathers once-thriving business.

Charles Nelson's Green Brier Distillery was the largest maker of Tennessee whiskey in the late 1800s, but statewide Prohibition shuttered the operation in 1909.

Today, the revived Nelsons Green Brier Distillery occupies 30,000 square feet in Nashvilles Marathon Village complex and employs nearly 30 people. The distillerys yet-to-be-released signature Tennessee whiskey is aging in barrels. Meanwhile, the companys Belle Meade Bourbon, Nelsons Green Brier Tennessee White Whiskey and Belle Meade Bourbon Sherry Cask Finish have already hit the market.

The demand for whiskey worldwide is just crazy right now, Charlie Nelson said. Weve had people reaching out to us from pretty much every state in the country ... and distributors and importers from different countries, asking about Tennessee whiskey and bourbon.

Nelsons Green Brier is just one Nashville distillery working to meet growing consumer demand. Corsair Distillery, which produces handcrafted, small batch spirits such as Quinoa Whiskey and Vanilla Bean Vodka, recently opened a new facility in Wedgewood-Houston and plans to open another one to increase capacity.

All around Nashville, consumers are proving theyre thirsty for whiskey of all kinds.

Grant Johnson, a manager at Red Spirits & Wine, said whiskey is one of the highest sales volume categories for the liquor store.

The entire whiskey category is really good for us, one of our best, but what were seeing is the aficionado types, who for a while were just after the new bourbons or cool new Tennessee whiskeys, (and) are now branching out, Johnson said, referring to growing interest in Scotch, Irish whiskeys and Japanese whiskeys.

A Tennessee tradition

A centuries-old industry in Tennessee, whiskey-making flourished in the late 1880s with hundreds of distillers across the state. However, Prohibition closed those operations and nearly killed the industry.

After a 29-year hiatus, Jack Daniels started making whiskey again in Lynchburg in 1938. Just 18 miles northeast, George Dickel was rebuilt near Tullahoma in 1958. Those two big-name brands have largely dominated the Tennessee whiskey industry for decades.

In 2013 state law established a legal definition of Tennessee whiskey for the first time. Known as the Lincoln County Process, it requires bourbon to be filtered through maple charcoal and aged in new, charred-oak barrels. There are only a handful of Tennessee whiskey-makers in the state, but several newer distillers are in the process of aging their own brands, which are expected to land in liquor stores in the coming years.

The one exemption from the law is Prichards Distillery, which opened a facility in Kelso in 1999 and was grandfathered in. The distiller sells Tennessee whiskey that does not undergo the charcoal mellowing process.

Ozgo, the chief economist at DISCUS, said the labor-intensive whiskey-making process  and its storied history in America  has helped spur consumer interest in the product.

Theres something romantic about distilling whiskey in copper stills and then sending it away in these very, very charming barrels for a number of years, Ozgo said.

Another key factor in whiskeys recent boom was the launch of AMCs television series Mad Men. The show is often credited with helping to popularize brown spirits and helping to drive the modern craft cocktail movement.

We like to say its the whole Mad Men craze of Don Draper bringing back the classic cocktails. ... Things like the Manhattan and Old Fashioned, those are just examples of a few things that are popular again, said George Dickel distiller Allisa Henley.

Whiskey's rise also has benefited U.S. farmers. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, corn production used in spirits jumped 176 percent from 2010 to 2014, and rye production used in spirits grew 64 percent during that time period.

Industry remains bullish

As Jack Daniels celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, the distiller is anticipating a record 300,000 visitors will pass through for tours and tastings.

George Dickel also expects a record 25,000 visitors this year. The company, owned by London-based Diageo, the worlds largest distilled spirits company, plans to add a new warehouse to its 600-acre property to increase capacity.

Arnett said Jack Daniels $140 million expansion  which comes just three years after a $103 million project  will include renovating the visitor center, building two new barrelhouses and expanding the existing bottling facility. There are 87 barrelhouses spread across the behemoths 2,000-acre property, each packed floor to ceiling with aging whiskey.

The expansion will add about 30 jobs to the 500-employee operation. Louisville, Ky.-based parent company Brown-Forman, which reported $684 million in net income last year, employs about 4,400 workers.

Arnett said Jack Daniels sells 12 million to 13 million cases of its flagship Black Label whiskey per year. The companys products are sold in 160 countries.

Still, the U.S. accounts for about 40 percent of Jack Daniels overall market share, and Arnett said there is plenty of growth opportunity at home, particularly with flavored whiskeys and rye. The company released its Single Barrel Rye earlier this year that's made with 70 percent rye, 18 percent corn and 12 percent malted barley.

Still a small segment of overall whiskey sales, rye's marked growth in popularity in recent years  supplier sales jumped from $15 million in 2009 to $129 million in 2015, according to DISCUS  gives Tennessee's distillers another source of optimism that the industry's upward trajectory will continue in the coming years.

I still believe that (rye) could be a huge opportunity for us going forward. That gives us a reason to believe we can grow the U.S. market and any other market that were currently in because were going to try to continue to put out new offerings that kind of keep interest around our brand, Arnett said.

USA TODAY

It's too late for 2015  we already know that all the Academy Awards for acting are going to a white person. But what about next year  will Hollywood's slate of 2016 movies result in the third year in a row of #OscarsSoWhite?

With what we know so far, it doesn't look good, according to USA TODAY's diversity report card.

There will almost certainly be last-minute changes or delays, or movies that get picked up later in the year at film festivals such as Cannes and Toronto. Who knows if a Precious or a Beasts of No Nation will suddenly appear and acquire all-important Oscar buzz? The picture can and likely will shift somewhat.

But for now, looking at the 184 movies officially announced for release this year by 14 studios (each rolling out as many as 20 movies or as few as seven), the Academy Awards next year may be just as pale and male as this year.

Our analysis doesn't assess the Oscar viability of 2016's forthcoming movies. But it shows a discernible lack of minority and female faces in major roles and among the directors of the films being released between January and December 2016. In fact, there's a striking number of movies in which there are only white faces.

No one makes the grade

In USA TODAY's report card for the coming year in the film industry, almost every studio deserves reprimand. But since we're grading on a curve, we've given credit to studios trying hard for a C, and four studios earned the highest grade of B.

Of the studios with more than 12 movies, Sony rated the highest, with a slate of 17 new movies that tallied to a final grade of B.

Paramount had the lowest grade, receiving an F for 14 movies.

Of the studios with 12 or fewer movies, Sony Pictures Classics, STX (each with nine movies) and Weinstein (12) earned a B.

The lowest grade among these studios went to Open Road, which received a D- for seven movies.

""Hollywood has been whitewashed, in front of the cameras and behind, from casting to writing to producers to actors,"" says Jeetendr Sehdev, a professor at the University of Southern California who has researched the challenges in improving diversity in the film industry.

It may not be deliberate but thoughtless, says casting director Lana Veenker of Cast Iron Studios in Portland, Ore., who recently cast supporting roles in Reese Witherspoon's Oscar-nominated Wild and also casts for TV shows such as NBC's Grimm, CW's Significant Mother and TNT's The Librarians.

""The huge majority of roles I get asked to cast are for men, and when we have conversations with directors or producers, I always ask them, 'Couldnt this role be played by a woman?' "" she says. ""And when it's brought to their attention, they often respond, 'Oh, yeah, why didnt we think of that?' ""

Don Cheadle, nominated for best actor in 2004's Hotel Rwanda, says scripts are often coded for minorities but not whites.

""If the description for the guy says, '25-year-old student, drives a (such and such car)  oh, thats the white guy. Because when it comes to your role, its 'black' or 'African-American,' "" Cheadle told USA TODAY. Black is specified; white is the default, he says.

The Oscar outcry

Ever since the Oscar nominations were announced last month  and for a second year in a row included no black, brown or Asian faces  voices both inside and outside Hollywood, from President Obama to outraged movie lovers on Twitter, have been criticizing, explaining or defending the results.

Prominent black and white performers were disappointed, even ""heartbroken,"" as Oscar winner Halle Berry put it. Some announced they would find something else to do Oscar night.

Supporting-actor nominee Sylvester Stallone (Creed) considered skipping the ceremony Feb. 28 but was talked out of it by his black director, Ryan Coogler. Neither Coogler nor Creed's black star, Michael B. Jordan, were nominated, although Stallone said they deserved to be.

""(Coogler) goes, Sly, just go there, try to represent the film. We feel you deserve it. Eventually, things will change,  Stallone told reporters at the annual Oscar luncheon for nominees earlier this month. ""I really do owe everything to these two.""

As the uproar mounted, the academy announced plans to expand its 6,000-plus voting membership  now dominated by older white males  in hopes of eventually producing a more inclusive slate of nominations.

But these measures are unlikely to have much of an effect this year, because most pictures on the studios' schedules for 2016 have already been written, cast or filmed, if not completely finished. Based on how the studios have described their slates, not enough of those movies prominently feature minority or female actors, directors or stories, so next year's nominations probably will reflect that.

In short: You can't get nominated if you're not in the picture.

""I think (next year) will be a repeat  I can't see how it won't be,"" says Shawn Edwards, co-founder of the African-American Film Critics Association and a film critic for a Fox affiliate in Kansas City, Mo.

He's excited by several forthcoming movies featuring black stories and casts, such as Miles Ahead (Sony Pictures Classics), about edgy jazz great Miles Davis, starring and directed by Cheadle, and The Birth of A Nation (Fox Searchlight), about slave rebel leader Nat Turner. Both were hailed at this year's Sundance Film Festival.

""But I think these (films) will get overlooked,"" Edwards laments. ""Sundance is completely diverse, and every year there are movies that get a lot of love and acclaim at Sundance and then they die after they hit the mainstream. They get lost in translation somewhere.""

Change is difficult

The problem can't be entirely explained as deliberate discrimination or white-male dominance in executive suites, according to Sehdev's startling findings at USC. His surveys show that people in the film industry and in the audiences  both black and white  say minority faces onscreen are perceived as less attractive than white faces.

""Guess what? Everybody has a white bias,"" Cheadle says. ""Black people have a white bias. Latinos have a white bias. Its slowly changing, but psychiatrists have done countless studies about it. We all have a white bias.""

Indeed, Hollywood still ""struggles to recognize the beauty of black actors,"" Sehdev says. ""Caucasian standards still dominate what is considered beautiful.""

Hollywood is in a lose-lose dilemma, Sehdev says. ""Even if more black performers are nominated in the near future, will it be perceived as a response to worthy talent or a response to pressure?

""Any change has to appear gradual and has to appear organic,"" Sehdev says. ""And that kind of change takes time.""

It isn't just about the money

Nearly two decades into the 21st century, more than 100 years after the invention of movies, why is this still an issue?

There are various explanations offered, reflecting the vast machinery of moving parts that make up the film industry. Writing, producing, casting, funding, directing, distributing, promoting  all of these interlocking departments can and do play different roles in fostering or not fostering diversity.

Are studios and film producers leery of placing, say, $50 million bets on movies about black stories and featuring black casts, assuming that white audiences won't watch? Maybe, but recent history suggests that's not always true. Besides, Hollywood's audience is global these days and most of the rest of the world is not white.

The whites-won't-watch argument clearly doesn't apply to TV and music, where diverse audiences have helped make shows like Empire a hit and scores of black musicians huge stars.

Paul Dergarabedian, senior box office analyst for comScore, the global media tracker, points out that 12 Years A Slave won three Oscars in 2014 and six other nominations. It had a host of diversity firsts: It was the first film by a black director (Steve McQueen), by a black producer (McQueen) and by a black writer (John Ridley) to win best picture.

Box office and Oscar sometimes intersect, sometimes follow different paths, he says.

""Look at Room, Carol, The Big Short, Spotlight  none of those made a boatload of money,"" says Dergarabedian about some of the current nominees. ""Money should not be relevant to the Oscars because (the Academy voters) nominate plenty of films that nobodys seen.""

The theory is that middle-class white guys generally make movies about middle-class-white-guy stories. The thinking is the similar demographic of the academy voters will relate best to those stories  and might not even see, say, Straight Outta Compton.

""It's not that members of the creative community can't create great characters who differ demographically from themselves  they can,"" says Martha Lauzen, a professor at San Diego State University who studies the dearth of women in TV and film.

Indeed, the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of Compton are middle-class whites. ""But when we consider hundreds or even thousands of cases, as my research has, certain tendencies do emerge.""

It's better in TV

A-list TV producer Ryan Murphy (Glee, American Horror Story) recently vowed to make sure his productions hired at least 50% women, people of color and LGBT people in directing jobs. But TV already has more women and minorities before and behind the cameras, says Norberto Barba, a veteran executive producer/director best known for helming NBC's Grimm and Law & Order: Criminal Intent.

""I've never seen so much progress in diversity hiring,"" says Barba, a member of the Directors Guild of America's diversity and Latinos committees. ""What's happening behind the scenes is really quite optimistic.""

As an example, he says NBC seeks out women and people of color for mentorships, opportunities to ""shadow"" working directors, even a boot camp, to help would-be directors get to a position where they can prove themselves.

He says these efforts are the result of the Directors Guild years ago going ""face-to-face"" with the networks to complain about the then-""dismal"" record behind the scenes for women and people of color, and to demand action.

""With 22 episodes, why shouldn't a certain percentage of the directors be women or people of color?"" Barba says. ""Im going to reach out to folks who represent part of our audience demographic, and we'll be better for it.""

Can this be fixed?

""The number one issue is jobs,"" says Edwards, echoing a common argument. ""You don't want quotas but you want more (women and minorities) who are working as writers, editors, costume designers and at the executive level. Create more opportunities for that and that in turn creates more opportunities for more movies about different types of (life) experiences.""

If enough A-level directors and producers and writers demand, ""I need more blacks and Hispanics and Asians in my crew, in my cast,"" then it's more likely to happen, Edwards says.

One way to improve diversity is to widen the pipelines that bring new talent into the film business, an already notoriously difficult industry to break into.

To be a screenwriter, writers need to develop skills that come with experience and time, and then they need the industry connections to get hired, says Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America East, the eastern division of the union that represents screenwriters.

""Thats where the pipeline comes in  how do we make it more possible for more diverse writers to build a career? One thing we're trying to do is overcome these historical networks,"" he says. ""It's not even necessarily a consciously discriminatory process, it's just that people hire people they know.""

Peterson says his union is preparing a campaign in the New York legislature seeking a new state tax credit for film and TV productions that hire more women and minorities, thus ""incentivizing"" diversity in hiring on film projects.

Another pipeline project was founded by Franklin Leonard, a black film-development executive who started The Black List online in 2012 to help connect would-be screenwriters of all races to industry pros. So far, according to the website, more than 225 films have been made from Black List scripts, including Oscar winners such as Argo and The King's Speech.

Casting pro Veenker last year started a talent diversity initiative featuring a free workshop to train actors of color in Portland to help broaden the pool of local talent. Thirty-two actors were admitted and some are already getting bookings (and moving to Los Angeles), she says. Now studios and state and local governments are considering ways to help fund it so she can hire more coaches and train more actors.

She believes there is an authentic desire across the board in the industry to do something about diversity. But it's complicated by fears that doing so might also increase minority faces in the ""usual"" roles, say as slaves or drug dealers.

""Nobody wants to be seen as stereotyping,"" Veenker says. So the dilemma for casting, directors and producers is they may have to ""discriminate against blacks in order not to appear to be discriminating against blacks.""

Give the last word to filmmaker Steven Spielberg, leading Hollywood titan, Oscar winner and father to two black children. He recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he was ""surprised"" that Compton wasn't nominated for best picture, nor British actor Idris Elba for his powerful performance in Beasts of No Nation. But he said everybody in the film industry, top to bottom, is responsible for reversing the diversity dilemma.

""We have to stop pointing fingers and blaming the academy,"" he said. ""It's people that hire, it's people at the main gate of studios and independents. It's the stories that are being told. It's who's writing diversity  it starts on the page. And we all have to be more proactive in getting out there and just seeking talent.""

One of cruise giant Carnival's newest ships has just emerged from its first significant makeover.

The four-year-old Carnival Magic received nearly half a dozen new eateries and bars during a two-week overhaul in the Bahamas that ended Sunday.

The upgrades to the 3,690-passenger vessel included the addition of Guys Burger Joint, a poolside burger venue developed in partnership with the Food Network's Guy Fieri that has been rolling out across the Carnival fleet.

Also new is the RedFrog Rum Bar, a poolside venue that specializes in rum-based frozen drinks, and Pizzeria del Capitano, which offers hand-tossed artisanal-style pizza.

Other additions include the interior Alchemy Bar, a pharmacy-themed lounge where mixologists prescribe colorful concoctions, and the BlueIguana Tequila Bar, another outdoor venue that has been debuting across the Carnival fleet.

The makeover took place at the Grand Bahama Shipyard on Grand Bahama Island.

Currently based in Galveston, Texas, the Carnival Magic will re-position to Port Canaveral, Fla. in April to begin year-round voyages to the Caribbean. The ship will operate two distinct seven-night itineraries: A western Caribbean route that features stops in Cozumel and Costa Maya in Mexico; Belize; and the Honduran island of Roatan, and an eastern Caribbean route that features calls at St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Grand Turk; and either Nassau, Bahamas or Amber Cove, Dominican Republic.

Here are top takeaways:

Donald Trump bounces back in a yuge way

Trump had a strong Super Tuesday, then a not-so-strong Saturday, as Ted Cruz won caucuses in Kansas and Maine and nearly overtook the New York billionaire in Louisiana. But Tuesday night, Trump scored big wins in Mississippi, and more importantly, Michigan. The GOP front-runner had previously demonstrated his strength in the South, with a string of wins there a week ago, but his victory in Michigan, the first state in the industrial Midwest to hold a primary, could bode well for the New York billionaire as the race turns to cold-weather states like Ohio and Illinois on March 15 where his Southern opponents are weaker.

Whats more, if he can show continued strength in states like this, home to so-called Reagan Democrats, he could have a stronger hand to play with skeptical Republicans who fear his nomination would lead to an electoral wipe-out in November. We will take many, many people away from the Democrats, he said. Whether thats true or not remains to be seen, but his case was strengthened Tuesday night.

Sanders wins big, and so does Clinton

Meanwhile, in the big surprise of the night, Bernie Sanders scored a significant upset over Hillary Clinton, defeating the front-runner in Michigan where pre-primary polls had shown she held sizable leads. The Vermont senators win in a big state with a more diverse population than other places hes won gives him just the boost he needs to move forward in a campaign where Clinton looked like she was on the verge of pulling away. It also makes neighboring Ohio suddenly look like a very competitive battleground.

Still, in the Democratic presidential race, raw muscle still matters. Thats why Clintons win in Mississippi, where she was pulling in more than 80% support, more than offsets her much closer loss in Michigan when it comes to the delegate race. Early Wednesday morning totals from the Associated Press showed Sanders pulling in 63 pledged delegates in Michigan, with Clinton getting 53. In Mississippi, Clinton got 28 and Sanders 1, meaning, all told, Clinton expanded her overall delegate lead. The Michigan loss is a disappointment for the front-runner, but the night was hardly a disaster.

What remains is a battle of attrition. Shell probably win in the end, but the Midwest is going to be a brutal slog. Hillary Clintons speech Tuesday night spoke of Democratic unity for the general election. It was perhaps premature.

Thatll leave a Marco

Theres really no other way to put it: Tuesday was a worst-case scenario for Marco Rubio and his hopes of emerging as the main alternative to Trump. Rubio disappeared from the leaderboards Tuesday night.

In Mississippi, he took around 5% of the vote, finishing fourth behind John Kasich and barely ahead of others. In Michigan he couldnt break 10%  again, leading only others in the field. Thats well below delegate thresholds, meaning hell walk away from the two biggest contests with literally nothing to show for it. In Idaho, partial results showed him hovering right near the cutoff line. While he has said that Florida will be his redemption on March 15, he is currently polling far behind Trump, and Cruz has been opening field offices there, trying to knock Rubio out of the race.

So where does that leave the candidate who so many in the Republican establishment had rallied around as their savior? Simply put, hes now perhaps the longest of long shots remaining in the GOP field.

Steak and Circus

Back to Trump (you didnt think we were done with him yet, did you?). The GOP front-runner continues to prove he is nothing like anybody who has ever run for president.

At a press conference in a Florida Trump resort, Trump packed the room with supporters, including former New York Yankees star Paul ONeill.

He trotted out a table full of Trump products, including his wine and steaks, to refute Mitt Romneys allegations that many of his companies had failed. He waved a copy of Trump magazine. He talked proudly and at great length about his golf properties, the club championships he has won, his fine hotels ...

By contrast, an hour later, Bernie Sanders came out to give a brief statement in a bare room that looked like a hunting lodge. He spoke for less than five minutes, took no questions, and walked away  on a night in which he scored a huge upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan. Suffice it to say, there are many ways to win a primary.

Still time on Kasichs clock

John Kasich made no news Tuesday night  which is exactly what he needed to do. Kasich and Cruz were neck-and-neck for second place in Michigan, with Kasich actually taking more delegates than Cruz. He even out-performed Rubio in Mississippi.

The Ohio governors entire premise was that he needed to perform well in Michigan to prove to his home-state voters that it is worth casting a vote for him in next Tuesdays winner-take-all primary there.

Win Ohio, Kasich argues, and the entire race is transformed.

Given that he has yet to pick up a win after more than 20 contests and that his nomination strategy hinges on somehow prevailing at a contested convention, this is a Hail Mary pass, to say the least. But with a decent showing in Michigan, he at least still has a chance to throw it.

Ted Cruzs Rocky Mountain high

The Texas senator won the Idaho primary, which is a good win and he pockets some delegates there. And while he did not make the same kind of late charge in Mississippi he had in Louisiana on Saturday, he still came in a solid second in the Magnolia State, and will cull some delegates from that finish as well.

But better for Cruz is Rubios bad night. Cruz is trying to squeeze Rubio out of the race, figuring he can consolidate the anti-Trump vote. Rubios terrible showing in the continental U.S. (we did not wait around for results from the Hawaii caucuses) leaves his campaign on life support and allows Cruz to focus on knocking him out of the race Tuesday. Cruz now faces the not impossible prospect that the GOP establishment is so desperate to defeat Trump that it will rally around the Texas enfant terrible.",[]

NBC brings back this surprise summer survivor, a throwback to the days when sitcom episodes could be built around current-events debates.

The structure can feel obvious and clumsy, but the show has a strong cast and offers a welcome, funny change of pace.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Anita Sarkeesian's new project,"['Est March', 'Brett Molina', 'P M']","Anita Sarkeesian appears on the set of her new series 'Ordinary Women: Daring to Defy History.' (Photo: Feminist Frequency)

Anita Sarkeesian  best known for her criticism of how women are portrayed in video games  is ready for a more ambitious type of history lesson.

Sarkeesian unveiled her next project on Tuesday, also International Women's Day, called Ordinary Women: Daring to Defy History. The five-part video series was revealed through crowdfunding site Seed & Spark, and will feature women whose contributions to history have been overlooked.

Their voices, accomplishments and experiences have been kind of erased, said Sarkeesian during an interview with USA TODAY. Theyre not in our every day language. Theyre not often taught in history books. Most of the people I talked to about this project hadn't heard of a lot of these women. Some of it is writing them back into history, telling these important stories.

Among the women featured in the series: Murasaki Shikibu, credited for writing the first modern novel; and womens rights advocate Emma Goldman.

The one of the studio show, which will combine acting and animation, will reflect the time period during which each woman lived. For example, the episode featuring Shikibu will include ink-brushed animations and a score using a Japanese koto. Even Sarkeesian  who serves as the series director and host  will style her hair, makeup and clothes in each episode to match the time period.

Its kind of this fun, interesting, engaging nuance to each of the episodes that I think is going to give it a different flair and experience, she says.

Sarkeesian hopes the women portrayed in this series will inspire others, including producers of movies, TV shows and video games to tell more of these stories. We want to normalize these women in history, says Sarkeesian. These woman doing these extraordinary things are ordinary in and of themselves  that women can do this.

Frequent target of harassment

Sarkeesian says she and her team have drawn personal inspiration from the struggles featured in Ordinary Women. In 2009, Sarkeesian launched Feminist Frequency  the website that will run the video series  to draw attention to how women are portrayed in popular culture.

Three years later, she unveiled a Kickstarter campaign for her most successful project to date: the web series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which explores depictions of women in interactive entertainment. The series drew praise from the video game industry, including an Ambassador Award presented in 2014 during the Game Developers Choice Awards.

Tropes vs. Women also spawned a wave of online harassment Sarkeesian says continues four years after the Kickstarter campaign first launched. In August 2014  near the birth of the controversial online argument over gaming culture called ""Gamergate""  Sarkeesian published an episode of Tropes vs. Women about ""women as background decoration"" in video games. After the video published, Sarkeesian says she was forced to leave her home after receiving a personal threat on her life. Sarkeesian also received countless abusive attacks on Twitter, with someone even creating a computer game where players can beat her up.

Two months later, Sarkeesian cancelled a speech at Utah State University after school officials received an email threatening to harm people who attend. (It) is absolutely absurd, says Sarkeesian of the abuse. Im being generous by saying its absurd.

But Sarkeesian says the process of researching Ordinary Women became almost emotional upon learning how much the struggles of each subject resonated with what she has endured.

""You look at these women from all these different time periods that are dealing with a lot of the same things that were dealing with but in a different context, she says. Its inspiring in a lot of ways, and it makes me realize that you are a part of this long legacy of women who have been fighting for the right to be acknowledged, represented and understood.

Conversations about online harassment have changed profoundly compared to several years ago, says Sarkeesian. She recounts her first discussion roughly four years ago with staff at Twitter, the social network routinely criticized for its lack of resources and support for harassed users. I walked away from that thinking, 'oh my God, this is never going to get fixed, like theyre never going to do anything.'

Fast forward to today, where Feminist Frequency is among several organizations consulted as part of the Twitter Trust & Safety Council that reviews policies and products. Sarkeesian says she consults regularly with Twitter and other social networks to help make online environments safer.

Meanwhile, next week's South by Southwest Festival will host a one-day summit about online harassment.

Its inspiring and important, but it also means we need to keep doing this work, says Sarkeesian. It doesnt mean that its done yet. It means we need to keep putting pressure on these companies and we need to keep starting to create that cultural shift where online harassment isnt normal.

Although the Tropes vs. Women series wraps up this year, Sarkeesian remains involved with video games. Feminist Frequency recently started running video game reviews, framing them in the context of how well women are represented. Sarkeesian also regularly consults with video game studios. Im not going anywhere.

Constellation Brands' Beer Division said Wednesday that it is recalling some Corona Extra 12-packs and 18-packs that may contain small pieces of glass.

The recall affects select packages of clear 12-ounce bottles with deposit labels in the U.S. as well as Guam. The voluntary action reflects less than one-tenth of 1% of that particular type and amount of the beverage in the marketplace, the company says.

""The safety and well-being of consumers is our top priority, and we take matters pertaining to the quality of our products very seriously,"" Paul Hetterich, president of Constellation Brands' Beer Division, said in a statement. ""We`re actively working with our distributor partners and retailers to quickly resolve the matter.''

The issue was discovered following routine quality assurance inspections at two AB InBev breweries that are temporarily manufacturing some of Constellation's beverages. Constellation says it has not gotten any complaints or heard of any injuries related to the bottles.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Missouri considers campus concealed carry gun laws,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Jessica Karins', 'The Journal', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Alexandra Samuels', 'Sam Lisker', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today']","Missouris state legislature is considering a bill that would lift a ban on concealed firearms on college and university

campuses.

The possession of firearms on college campuses is currently prohibited in Missouri. Now, Republican Missouri state senators Brian Munzlinger and Bob Dixon aim to change that law. They introduced legislation that would require all college campuses in Missouri to allow concealed carry unless they comply with additional safety regulations.

If the proposal, Senate Bill 731, becomes law, schools wishing to ban concealed weapons on campus must place metal detectors and security personnel at each entrance to screen individuals before they enter. The enforcement of this policy would be the responsibility of the colleges departments of public safety.

Missouri state senator Scott Sifton and state representative Jeanne Kirkton, whose districts both include Webster University, said they plan to oppose the bill.

My constituency voted overwhelmingly against conceal and carry the last time it came to a vote, Sifton said. I dont think folks in Webster Groves want concealed carry on the Webster University campus.

Kirkton said the idea that concealed carry permit holders could help stop shooters is unrealistic.

If someone with a concealed carry permit actually does get involved in trying to stop a shooting, and law enforcement comes on the scene, its difficult to know whos the good guy and whos the bad guy, Kirkton said.

Kirkton also cited concerns about drug and alcohol use and suicide rates on college campuses as reasons why they are unsafe places for firearms.

Andy Pelosi is the executive director and cofounder of the organizations GunFreeKids.org and The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus. He said he opposes legislation like Missouris proposed bill because he believes it will cause more harm than it prevents.

Theres always an increased risk for an unintentional shooting, Pelosi said. He also cited the number of suicides among college students as a reason to limit their access to guns.

Pelosi said he thought it was unlikely a student or faculty member with a concealed weapon could help stop or prevent a shooting.

Our view on that is that the vast majority of people who have a concealed weapons permit do not have tactical training, he said.

Chris Armstrong, a business management major at Webster who is also a police detective, said that he sees the value in the proposed law.

Concealed carry for universities is a good idea if it helps the student body feel safer, Armstrong said.

While he felt most people who wanted to commit a crime would bring a weapon onto campus even if they were not allowed to, he said others being armed could be an incentive to think twice.

With the idea that there may be other students or staff members that may be able to counter the attack, that may be enough to act as a deterrent, Armstrong said.

The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), which promotes independent and strong state legislatures and studies trends in their lawmaking, has been tracking the issue of guns-on-campus laws for about four years.

Suzanne Hultin, an NCSL policy specialist, said about two states per year introduce similar legislation.

I think its part of a bigger trend thats been going on nationwide, she said.

Hultin said most of the laws are introduced by Republicans, and that recently, they often relate to increasing awareness of campus sexual assault.

In the last year, weve seen more legislation that tries to link the two together, Hultin said.

Currently, 19 states ban concealed weapons on campus, and eight mandate that they be allowed either on public or all campuses. The remaining 23 leave the decision up to individual schools.

The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA) released a document in 2008 stating their opposition to concealed carry on campus. The organization said that such policies raise the risk of crime, and that student gun owners make campuses less safe, not more.

Because the language of the bill is still subject to change, Websters director of public relations, Patrick Giblin, said any statement from Public Safety would be premature at this time.

Webster Groves police department public information officer Andy Miller also declined to be interviewed, but said in an email that the department is supportive of legislation that, by design, helps control potential gun violence.

In at least one state, new laws about concealed carry may have an impact on academics. The Houston Chronicle reported that professors at the University of Houston, which will soon allow concealed carry under a new Texas law, discussed limiting sensitive classroom discussion. A slideshow advised professors to drop certain topics from your curriculum and not go there if you sense anger.

Gwyneth Williams, a political science professor at Webster and the current president of the faculty senate, said she could imagine the presence of guns on campus changing the behavior of both professors and students.

Williams spoke about the issue at a faculty senate meeting and said that, at Webster, she has only heard from people who are opposed to the bill.

As far as I know, no one in the administration is in favor of having people with guns on campus, and I doubt many faculty members are in favor of it either, she said.

Kirkton said that if the Senate passed the bill, its difficult to determine whether it would become law.

I think it would pass the House in a heartbeat, Kirkton said. Whether Governor [Jay] Nixon would veto it is another question. I think he probably would.

Sifton said that he believes the legislation could spark a conversation about gun safety on Missouri campuses, but that it goes about it in the wrong way.

I dont think that Jefferson City should dictate how thats going to be done in every community, Sifton said.",[]

Even after Bette Midler ribbed her for it, and Kim wrote an essay about it, it's still what people are talking about.

usatoday.com,2013-05-02 00:00:00,Viewpoint: Nobody cares about your double major,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Erin Grattan', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","It doesnt make you cool or intense to double major. If you enjoy and feel you will benefit from two areas of study equally, consider majoring in one, and then just taking some of the courses in the other.

Before I went to college, I always thought I would major in English.

But after taking and loving psych 101 my freshman year, I was torn between majoring in English and majoring in psychology. At the time, declaring a major seemed like a life-altering decision, and clearly something about which to be stressed.

I felt that I would be giving something up if I picked one major over the other  committing to one destiny over another  so instead, I finally decided I should do both. I would double major! If one is good then two is better, right? I was excited to tell my advisor about my plan, and consequently, I was surprised when he told me it was a pretty dumb one.

To be fair, he probably didnt use the word dumb. But he did question me about why the need to do both and what I felt I would gain from doing so. I was shocked that he didnt see the seemingly obvious value and prestige in double majoring. Instead, he encouraged me to think about what might be lost by double majoring  namely, the flexibility to take more electives and dabble in various disciplines  and made me realize that there might not be a point to double majoring after all.

Long after college (if you call six years long), that conversation has stuck with me.

Why? Because I was so wrong, and my advisor was so right. I ultimately decided to major in English and ended up with a minor in psychology (after taking all the psychology classes I chose to take), but some of the best courses I took in college were outside of my major and minor.

I didnt even know what art history was before college, but I liked the first class I took so much that I took a second. I took courses in film, philosophy, political science, sociology, and Spanish. I took extra creative writing courses because I had the room. Had I double majored, and thus been bound to additional course requirements for a second major, I wouldnt have had room for all of those extra courses, and would have had an arguably less well-rounded academic experience than I had.

The other reason that conversation has stuck with me is because I have worked in undergraduate and graduate admissions, and questions about majors are understandably common.

What job can I get with that major?

Can I get into your grad program even though I had an unrelated major?

What one majors in does not determine ones fate for the rest of his life. If a student knows exactly what he wants to do after college, then it certainly makes sense for him to choose a relevant major that will help him prepare to enter that field.

But in large part, nobody really cares what you majored in, and nobody cares at all if you double majored, majored and minored, majored and double minored, and so on. (By the way, nobody cares what your SAT scores were either, so its time to take them off your resume, everyone ever.)

During college I would hear people brag about their rigorous course load due to their double major. I have even heard several-years-out-of-college graduates similarly reflect on their experience double majoring.

Guys! It doesnt make you cool or intense to double major. If you enjoy and feel you will benefit from two areas of study equally, consider majoring in one, and then just taking some of the courses in the other. Whats the difference, really? Being able to say you double majored? But weve covered that already. Nobody cares.

I would be remiss not to acknowledge that in some cases, it might make sense to double major.

There may be certain industries and organizations that care a bit more about what a student majored in, and might even care that he or she double majored. Perhaps my perspective is a bit skewed based on my personal experience and my affinity for liberal arts education.

My advice, then, is to not double major for the sake of double majoring. Take courses that are interesting to you, and allow yourself the flexibility to take courses you didnt necessarily plan to take. College should largely be about learning for the sake of learning.

But fear not, I have practical advice, too.

Throughout college, spend time thinking about your post-college career. Get internships, go on informational interviews, and do research about the field you wish to enter. Maybe you will find out that your dream employer or graduate institution cares a whole lot about your major. Maybe they would even prefer that you have a double major. Now that would be a good reason.

But double majoring so that you can say you did, or because it seems badass, or because you cant make up your mind?

Well, thats a pretty dumb plan.

The Gosnell case only points to the need to inspect clinics on a regular basis, just like all health facilities should be inspected.

Hospital admitting privileges and surgical center standards are irrelevant to that and are a mere smokescreen.

 Kevin Rethwisch

Where is the evidence that requiring admitting privileges would increase safety for women in Texas?

Women with complications must be admitted to an emergency room, with or without admitting privileges. What difference would the requirement make?

 Dan Porath

The admitting privileges do help ensure follow-up care for the patients. While we may not agree on the legality of abortion, surely we can advocate for safe, legal and rare.

That means more support for pregnant women and new mothers including, but not limited to, paid leave, affordable child care, and enforcing child support payments from deadbeat fathers. I think we can agree on those things, correct?

Laws in various states are making abortions harder to get. Everyone knows what these laws are for, and it would be nice if anti-abortion groups would simply tell the truth about what they want. Is their argument so weak that they need to lie?

Pop Culture: The hot trend in college football? Coaches using DJs in practice. It is only a matter of time before college footballs competitive culture means Alabama has its own house DJ making a million dollars a year.

Not a win at all: Despite a brilliant turn on Twitter on Sunday during the Lakers-Spurs game, Kobe Bryant wont keep up with the in-game tweets, which is a shame. This is why we cant have nice things.

Plus: Robinson Cano linked to Biogenesis? (via ESPN.com)

First person: Went out to the ballpark last night for Nats-Cards and caught the Shelby Miller show. Needless to say: Real deal is an understatement. Glad I got to see MLBs most exciting rookie first-hand, along with Bryce Harper, still my No. 1-ranked Must-See Athlete of 2013. (Meanwhile: Check out a list of six cant-miss MLB future stars.)

Did CP3 push off? Phil Jackson on Twitter says: Whatever...my answer to the refs was: just call the violations on the superstars, make them play the game the right way-they make adjustments... As per MJs shot in game 6. That wasnt a push off. It was a helping hand to a broke down comrade. [smiley-face emoticon]

NEW YORKI intentionally dropped a $672 Galaxy S7 phone into the toilet. I wasnt expressing displeasure over Samsungs newest flagship phonein fact I really like this latest handset, along with its pricier sibling the Galaxy S7 edge. I dropped it in the toilet, and separately in the sink, to test the phones resistance to water. It came through unscathed.

The two new Galaxys measure up to a certification standard known as IP68, which means they can be submerged up to 5 feet for up to a half hour. Theyre resistant to dust too.

Whats more, the phones dont have awkward protective flaps covering the USB port like a prior water resistant model, the Galaxy S5. But dont get carried away. The phones are water resistant, not waterproof. I wouldnt swim with the device, take a long hot shower with it, or necessarily drop it into your own toilet. Yes, the phone will do fine with the water. I just wouldnt want it to get flushed down the drain.

usatoday.com,2013-04-23 13:12:51+00:00,Jerome Bettis thinks the NFL is devaluing the running back position,"['Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Andrew Joseph', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Chris Strauss']","Jerome Bettis doesnt expect to hear the names of any running backs announced from the podium at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. With at least four offensive linemen projected to go in the top ten of the 2013 NFL Draft, the former Pittsburgh Steelers powerhouse sees the evolution of pro offenses continuing in more of a pass friendly direction.

Theres the devaluing of the running back position, Bettis told USA TODAY Sports. I dont know if theres one running back in this years draft where people say hes going to be a first round pick. I dont know when the last time thats been the case. You see devaluing of the running backs and the higher valuation of the offensive line. Its difficult for me because I dont want to see the art of being a running back disappear.

Alabamas Eddie Lacy is projected as the first back off the board in the 2013 draft, with most experts projecting him as an early to mid second round selection. Lacy, like 2012 third overall pick Trent Richardson, played in Nick Sabans offense with the Crimson Tide, one of the few college programs that Bettis sees as a springboard for NFL backs.

Youve got three schools who predominantly run a pro style offense, Bettis said. Georgia. LSU. Alabama. After that its a crapshoot to get a good running back you can have as a premiere running back. As a result of that, youre not seeing the position valued very high anymore.

Bettis, who made the final cut of Hall of Fame voting for the 2013 class before being eliminated, also sees the leagues new rule changes as another impediment to the NFL running game. In an attempt to crack down on concussions, the league declared in March that players will not be able to deliver forcible blows with the crown of the helmet, a shift that would have the most effect on running backs. The NFLs sixth-leading career rusher joins Hall of Famer Earl Campbell among many current and former backs against the change.

Its a ridiculous rule because its hard to officiate. Now youre putting officials in a bind, Bettis said. Youre creating uncertainty in a running backs mind, which is ten times worse than anything you can ever do. Now he gets to that line and hes got to wonder, Am I past the tackle box? These plays happen in a split second and for you to have to think about anything other than protecting yourself puts these running backs at more risk.

Theyre conscious of wanting to make changes so these concussions dont happen and I think it was really a knee jerk reaction to the concussion that [Stevan] Ridley from the Patriots got in the playoffs. That was a situation where it was unavoidable. The safety filled the hole and the running back had to put his head down to protect himself and bang. Now theyre looking at a play like that and saying if he doesnt put his head down, he doesnt get a concussion. If he doesnt put his head down, the helmet goes into his ribcage and he fumbles the football and breaks a rib potentially. I understand what youre trying to do but you didnt really look at the process entirely.

While the new rule makes Bettis uncomfortable, hes been using his voice to spread the word about something that made him literally sick. As a 14-year-old, Bettis found himself in a Michigan emergency room after a bad allergic reaction following an order of shrimp fried rice. Hes now promoting Auvi-Q, a credit card sized auto-injector that people with severe allergies can use in the case of anaphylaxis.

You need a game plan, which I didnt have for a long time, Bettis said of his shellfish allergy. I would say to myself that I need to make sure I didnt eat it and if I did eat it, I didnt know what to do next other than go to the hospital. Now I have a backup plan.",[]

Allegiant Air will unveil three new cities and 22 new routes Tuesday in what the company is calling one of its biggest single expansion announcements ever.

The new cities joining Allegiants route map are Albuquerque, Evansville, Ind., and Santa Rosa, Calif. Allegiants first flights from Santa Rosa will start May 19 while its first routes from Albuquerque and Evansville begin June 2. With the three new destinations, Allegiant will serve 114 cities.

Beyond the five routes from the three new cities, Allegiant is also adding 17 additional routes that connect cities that it already serves. Markets getting new routes ranged from larger destinations like Los Angeles and Austin to smaller cities like Belleville, Ill., and Asheville, N.C.

BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage

""Its a good mix. This announcement has something of everything,""Lukas Johnson, Allegiants Vice President of Planning, says in a phone interview with Today in the Sky. ""No airport gets more than four routes. Its a good mix of medium-sized (markets) and traditional small-sized destinations (with demand for leisure routes). Its across-the-board growth.""

Allegiants Florida focus cities at Orlando-Sanford, Jacksonville and Destin-Fort Walton Beach each received four new routes. Elsewhere, Allegiant's seasonal focus city in Myrtle Beach, S.C., was another big winner, landing three new nonstop routes.

That fits in line with Allegiant's business model, which is built around offering nonstop flights from small and medium-sized markets to destinations that appeal to leisure fliers.

As with its other recent expansions, Allegiant has increasingly pushed into major airports that it used to avoid. Allegiant once flew almost exclusively between its focus cities and very small markets like Plattsburgh, N.Y.; Grand Island, Neb.; and Appleton, Wis. But Alleigant has started looking to larger markets in recent years. Austin, Oklahoma City, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Indianapolis and Cincinnati are among the bigger markets added to Allegiant's network since 2013.

And Tuesday's announcement is already Allegiant's second major expansion announced so far in 2016. In January, Allegiant detailed plans to add three cities -- Baltimore, El Paso and Destin, Fla. -- as part of a 19-route expansion. Baltimore will become one of Allegiant's largest non-focus city airports when service launches there in April.

Albuquerque was the only new mid-size market added in Tuesdays announcement. But Allegiant did reveal plans to expand its presence in several big markets it already flies from. Los Angeles, for example, got two new routes while Oklahoma City, Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, each got one in.

""Weve been rapidly adding a lot of these mid-sized cities,"" Johnson says. ""We typically launch those mid-size markets with (service to) a couple of our destinations. Now its about connecting them up with the rest of our network.""

Among the more interesting new routes included in Allegiants latest expansion:

Los Angeles-Reno

Allegiant will join a crowded marketplace flying between these cities. The carrier will go head-to-head against three other carriers. American, Southwest, United each offer multiple daily round-trip flights between the cities. Allegiant will start with two flights a week.

""Certainly its a large market with a lot of competition on it,"" Johnson tells Today in the Sky. ""But theres no ultra low-cost competition on it, so we feel pretty good about that.

Los Angeles-Memphis (seasonal)

One of Allegiants rare routes to connect two major metro areas, Allegiant says its two weekly flights are aimed squarely at leisure fliers. Allegiant will go head-to-head with Delta on the route.

""They have a business schedule on the Delta flight,"" Johnson says. ""They run Monday through Friday. They dont serve weekends. It really caters to business travelers only. Its quite pricey.""

""Were not looking to take a business customer away from Delta,"" Johnson adds. ""Their main goal is to be able to take high-fare business customers on a good schedule to where they need to go. For us, well have a nice flow of flights for a leisure traveler there.""

Austin-Albuquerque

Aside from bringing Allegiant to Albuquerque, this route is another that will connect two relatively large markets for the airline.

""Austin is one of the top unserved markets"" from Albuquerque, Johnson says. ""Weve got a couple other markets running to Austin, so it made a lot of sense to us"" to add Albuquerque too.

Destin, Fla.-Fort Lauderdale (seasonal)

This new Allegiant route will be entirely within Florida, making it one of only three intra-state routes operated by the carrier. San Diego-Stockton, Calif., and Las Vegas-Reno are the others. What makes the Destin-Fort Lauderdale route stand out is that it connects two leisure-oriented markets  a departure from Allegiants typical strategy. Johnson confirms that the route is aimed at leisure passengers in both markets, but says that Allegiant also hopes to lure locals wanting to visit friends or relatives living in the other part of Florida.

The full list of Allegiant's 22 new routes

The full details for all of Allegiant's new routes are below. Allegiant, which rarely flies daily service on any of its routes, plans to launch with two flights a week on all of the new routes.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,USA TODAY NETWORK biolabs investigation wins national journalism prize,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Usa Today Staff']","Biohazard symbol. (Photo: CDC)

A USA TODAY NETWORK investigation of safety and security lapses at hundreds of secretive biodefense laboratories has won the prestigious Scripps Howard Award for public service reporting.

In the wake of some high-profile accidents at federal labs, the ""Biolabs in Your Backyard"" investigation, published throughout 2015, revealed hundreds of additional accidents at corporate, university, government and military labs nationwide. It also exposed a system of fragmented federal oversight and pervasive secrecy that obscures failings by facilities and regulators.

""This series draws power from its precision reporting about lab mistakes and near miss incidents that put scientists and the public at risk,"" the awards judges said in announcing the prizes on Tuesday. ""It would not be an overstatement to say that the pressure for reform from USA Today's reporting has significantly reduced the possibility of a public health catastrophe.""

The investigation has resulted in bipartisan House and Senate committee investigations and spurred federal regulators to re-examine how they oversee safety at labs working with potential bioterrorism pathogens, called select agents. The White House in October issued a sweeping, 187-page lab safety directive that cited the USA TODAY NETWORKs reporting in calling for greater transparency and public accountability on lab accidents. And in November, the CDC replaced the director of its select agent lab regulation program.

This project  which is online at biolabs.usatoday.com  was the result of reporting by Alison Young, along with Nick Penzenstadler, Tom Vanden Brook and a team of journalists in local newsrooms across the USA TODAY NETWORK.

In the contest's opinion writing category, Nancy Kaffer, a political columnist for the Detroit Free Press, won for a body of work, particularly about the Flint, Mich., water crisis. Tim Swarens and Suzette Hackney of The Indianapolis Star were named finalists in this category for a series of editorials that fought for civil rights protections for LGBT citizens. Both newsrooms are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

Winners in other categories included The New York Times for human interest storytelling, The Wall Street Journal for business and economics reporting, BuzzFeed for investigative reporting, Frontline for television/cable in-depth coverage and The Boston Globe for distinguished service to the First Amendment. The Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C., won two awards, for breaking news and for community journalism.

The USA TODAY NETWORK's biolabs investigation revealed that more than 100 labs working with potential bioterror pathogens have faced secret federal sanctions for safety violations, yet regulators allowed them to keep experimenting while failing on inspections, sometimes for years. Despite federal officials efforts to keep secret the identities of these troubled labs, the project named names, revealing they included several prestigious institutions, such as a university hosting a controversial new $1.25 billion federal biodefense lab.

Reporters also exposed details about the operations and safety records of more than 200 high-containment labs across the nation, facilities whose identities have eluded even the Government Accountability Office. There is no publicly available list of such facilities and the GAO has warned that even the federal government doesnt know where they all are because of a patchwork of regulation. The project's Biolabs in Your Backyard online interactive features individual stories about each facility and its research, plus more than 20,000 pages of safety records that dozens of labs fought to keep secret.

The Scripps Howard Foundations national journalism competition was established in 1953. Winners receive trophies and share $180,000 in cash prizes. The full list of Scripps Howard Awards winners is online. They will be recognized at an April 28 banquet in Phoenix.

usatoday.com,2014-08-12 00:00:00,20 big profitable U.S. companies paid no taxes,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","U.S. companies are looking for all sorts of ways to reduce their tax bill. But scores of big U.S. companies just paid no taxes or effective tax rates of 0%.

There are 20 companies in the Standard & Poors 500, including drugmaker Merck (MRK), computer storage company Seagate (STX) and automaker General Motors (GM), which reported effective tax rates of 0% or lower in the second calendar quarter despite reporting a profit during the period, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. To be included, the companies also needed to report positive earnings before taxes including unusual items.

This analysis shows that while U.S. companies and investors constantly grumble about corporate tax rates, there are many companies that pay nowhere near the highest rates. This is the rule, not an exception. A 2013 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that profitable U.S. firms filing a Schedule M-3 paid federal taxes of 13% of pretax worldwide income. Thats well below the top 35% statutory rate.

But some profitable companies can pay even less than that during time to time. And the second quarter is a another good example.

The biggest example during the second quarter is drugmaking giant Merck. The company had a negative effective tax rate during the second quarter of 7.5%, meaning it actually got a net tax credit. Thats despite the fact that income before taxes at Merck soared 52% to $1.9 billion during the quarter.

Merck appears to be gaining on the tax front, in part, by the fact it earns profits in countries with lower tax rates. In its regulatory filing, Merck pointed to the beneficial impact of foreign earnings as part of the reason for the low effective tax rate. Perhaps more importantly, Merck got a tax benefit in the quarter from an option exercise connected with rival AstraZeneca buying Mercks interest in a partnership. Financial moves connected to the deal resulted in Merck getting a one-time tax benefit.

Mercks effective tax rate last year was much higher, 18%, since it didnt have some of the same benefits. But Seagate has made habit out of keeping effective tax rates low. During its fiscal year ended June 27, the company had an income tax benefit of $14 million, which was double the $7 million income tax benefit of fiscal 2013, according to the companys regulatory filing. During fiscal 2014, the company got a big tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances recorded in prior periods. But Seagate also points out it gets a boost from the fact its parent holding company is based in low-tax country Ireland. The company paid this low tax rate despite reporting income before taxes of $1.6 billion during the quarter.

Again, these companies describe how theyre following appropriate tax rules. But its still interesting to see how some corporate income escapes taxes on any given quarter. Keep in mind too several of the stocks on the list, including Public Storage (PSA) and Kimco Realty (KIM) are real-estate investment trusts. These companies are required to pay out nearly all their profits to investors, which keeps taxes low at the corporate level. Thats one reason this corporate structure is getting more popular.

Below are the 20 companies in the S&P 500 that reported 0% (or lower) effective tax rates during the second calendar quarter of 2014:

Company Symbol Net income Q2 2014 ($ mils) Merck MRK $2,004 Seagate Tech.

LAS VEGAS  Wearables and other connected devices have been available to help treat chronic conditions like asthma and heart disease for a while now. But thus far, the nations 30 million diabetics havent seen much to help them improve their health or reduce the daily grind of finger pricks and needle pokes.

The $2.5 billion connected-care industry may be off to a late start in diabetes, but its making up for lost time. A new breed of connected glucometers, insulin pumps and smartphone apps is hitting the market. They promise to make it easier for diabetics to manage the slow-progressing disease and keep them motivated with feedback and support.

Artificial pancreas

In as little as two years, the industry plans to take charge of the entire uncomfortable, time-consuming routine of checking and regulating blood-sugar levels with something called an artificial pancreas. Such systems mimic the functions of a healthy pancreas by blending continuous glucose monitoring, remote-controlled insulin pumps and artificial intelligence to maintain healthy blood-sugar levels automatically.

For Jeroen Tas, CEO of Philips Connected Care and Health Informatics unit, diabetes management is also personal: his daughter Kim is diabetic.

I have seen my daughter struggle with her condition for 13 years and I am aware there are 400 million other people that live with diabetes, he said. I am happy that we can contribute to a real solution to manage her condition. We are excited to see the first steps of a big transformation in health care.

Philips showcased its prototype diabetes management app, which helps patients track their condition and share data, insights and feedback, at a recent health-tech trade show in Las Vegas.

The diabetes management app from Philips. (Photo: Philips)

From the numbers, you might think that companies in the connected-health arena would have targeted diabetes care ahead of other chronic conditions. Diabetics in the U.S. outnumber Americans with asthma, congestive heart failure, COPD and depression. And if you count the countrys 86 million pre-diabetics, they even exceed the 70 million Americans with high-blood pressure, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control.

One reason for the slow adoption is diabetes is much more difficult to take on with technology.

Diabetes is a more complex disease than COPD, heart failure and asthma, said Dr. Nick van Terheyden, Dells Chief Medical Officer. The cost savings take much longer to accrue. It takes years of poor management for severe, expensive complications to show up. And better management doesnt pay off nearly as quickly.

For example, with heart failure, simply monitoring for weight gain can give an early warning that a patient is headed for hospitalization, and medication adjustments can often head that off, van Terheyden said. So there is a big, immediate savings with a fairly simple input.

Steve Burger, an AT&T vice president for business development and connected health, agreed. He told me that the communications giant recently made remote diabetes care a connected-health priority. AT&T is partnering with YOFiMeter to bring the startups connected glucose meter to market. The YOFiMeter is much less obtrusive than traditional meters, and automatically collects results and stores them in the cloud.

No more finger pricks

Technology from a South San Francisco startup could eliminate the need for finger pricks altogether. Profusa announced in January a series of implant devices that can be used to continuously measure glucose and other blood chemistry elements. The devices, which are about a tenth of an inch long, are injected under the skin and can provide measurements for up to two years with the aid of a special reader and a smartphone app.

Dexcom, an established glucose monitor supplier, is developing disposable eye contacts that continuously measure glucose levels with Verily, the connected health arm of Alphabet, Googles parent. The pair hope to have the devices ready for market in 2018.

Medtronic already offers an injectable sensor that continuously monitors glucose levels. Patients still need to calibrate the system several times a day, so it doesnt eliminate finger-prick tests. But it can help Type 1 diabetics avoid episodes of dangerously low blood sugar levels. Medtronic and IBM have partnered on an app that uses Watson to predict hypoglycemic events up to three hours ahead of time.

And there is more good news on the horizon, with several efforts under way to build artificial pancreas systems. Insulet, an insulin pump supplier, and Mode Automated Glucose Control said they will be working together with university researchers to produce a system. They hope to begin clinical trials later this year.

A year ago, an artificial pancreas seemed like a long way off. No longer.

I do think the continuous glucose monitoring is a lot closer than some believe, said Dells van Terheyden.

Indeed.

Have you watched this incredible shot? The buzzer-beating dagger by Chris Paul (yes, for the win).

With time expiring, Paul sent the Los Angeles Clippers caroming over the Memphis Grizzlies and up 2-0 in their series.

As you would expect, the Clippers were happy.

And Blake Griffin is never letting go.

Marc Gasol isnt letting go either, but for different reasons.

And Darrell Arthur? Well, Darrell Arthur is just sad.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Pentagon report justifies deployment of military spy drones over the U.S.,"['Gregg Zoroya', 'Est March', 'P M']","The Pentagon has deployed drones to spy over U.S. territory for non-military missions over the past decade according to a new report. USA TODAY

The Pentagon has deployed drones to spy over U.S. territory for non-military missions over the past decade, but the flights have been rare and lawful, according to a new report.

The report by a Pentagon inspector general, made public under a Freedom of Information Act request, said spy drones on non-military missions have occurred fewer than 20 times between 2006 and 2015 and always in compliance with existing law.

The report, which did not provide details on any of the domestic spying missions, said the Pentagon takes the issue of military drones used on American soil ""very seriously.""

The Pentagon has publicly posted at least a partial list of the drone missions that have flown in non-military airspace over the United States and explains the use of the aircraft. The site lists nine missions flown between 2011 and 2016, largely to assist with search and rescue, floods, fires or National Guard exercises.

A senior policy analyst for the ACLU, Jay Stanley, said it is good news no legal violations were found, yet the technology is so advanced that it's possible laws may require revision.

""Sometimes, new technology changes so rapidly that existing law no longer fits what people think is appropriate,"" Stanley said. ""It's important to remember that the American people do find this to be a very, very sensitive topic.""

Other federal agencies own and operate drones. The use of unmanned aerial surveillance (UAS) drones over the USA surfaced in 2013 when then-FBI director Robert Mueller testified before Congress that the bureau employed spy drones to aid investigations but in a ""very, very minimal way, very seldom.""

The inspector general analysis was completed March 20, 2015, but not released publicly until last Friday.

It said that with advancements in drone technology along with widespread military use overseas, the Pentagon established interim guidance in 2006 governing when and whether the unmanned aircraft could be used domestically. The interim policy allowed spy drones to be used for homeland defense purposes in the U.S. and to assist civil authorities.

But the policy said that any use of military drones for civil authorities had to be approved by the Secretary of Defense or someone delegated by the secretary. The report found that defense secretaries have never delegated that responsibility.

The report quoted a military law review article that said ""the appetite to use them (spy drones) in the domestic environment to collect airborne imagery continues to grow, as does Congressional and media interest in their deployment.""

Military units that operate drones told the inspector general they would like more opportunities to fly them on domestic missions if for no other reason than to give pilots more experience to improve their skills, the report said. ""Multiple units told us that as forces using the UAS capabilities continue to draw down overseas, opportunities for UAS realistic training and use have decreased,"" the report said.

A request for all cases between 2006 and 2015 in which civil authorities asked the military for use of spy drones produced a list of ""less than twenty events,"" the report said. The list included requests granted and denied.

The list was not made public in the report. But a few examples were cited, including one case in which an unnamed mayor asked the Marine Corps to use a drone to find potholes in the mayor's city. The Marines denied the request because obtaining the defense secretary's ""approval to conduct a UAS mission of this type did not make operational sense.""

Shortly before the inspector general report was completed a year ago, the Pentagon issued a new policy governing the use of spy drones. It requires the defense secretary to approve all domestic spy drone operations. It says that unless permitted by law and approved by the secretary, drones ""may not conduct surveillance on U.S. persons."" It also bans the use of armed drones over the United States for anything other than training and testing.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,'SuperBetter' author explains how games help with extreme stress,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Greg Toppo']","Jane McGonigal, author of the recent book SuperBetter (Photo: Kiyash Monsef)

In 2009, a serious concussion sent game theorist and designer Jane McGonigal to bed with strict instructions from her doctor: ""No reading, no writing, no running, no video games, no work, no e-mail, no alcohol, and no caffeine.

In other words,"" McGonigal would later write, ""no reason to live.

She remembered thinking, ""I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game."" The experience, thankfully, pushed her to do the latter. McGonigal created a ""role-playing recovery game"" she called Jane the Concussion Slayer. Her experience led to a TED Talk that has been viewed nearly 5.5 million times and laid the groundwork for her second book, SuperBetter, released last fall.

We focus on positive emotions, like curiosity about what we might be capable of, so we feel energized by challenge rather than overwhelmed by it Jane McGonigal

Probably the foremost authority on the psychological and social strengths of video gamers, McGonigal wasa keynote speaker on Wednesday at the annual South by Southwest Edu education festival in Austin, Texas.

USA TODAY's Greg Toppo recently asked her to reflect on a few of her ideas:

Q: In the new book, you tell readers not just about the power of games but how to be gameful in the face of extreme stress and personal challenge. What's being ""gameful""?

A: When we play games, our brains respond differently to stress and obstacles. Were better able to control our attention and ignore distractions. We fire up the hippocampus, which is the learning and memory center of the brain, so we learn faster. We focus on positive emotions, like curiosity about what we might be capable of, so we feel energized by challenge rather than overwhelmed by it. As a result, our bodies dont suffer the negative health effects of performing under pressure. We also get inside other peoples minds more effectively. We get better at trying to understand their motivations and intentions, which builds up the empathy muscle in our mind. All of these are important psychological skills that we get better at with practice. The key to being gameful is to learn how to tap into these skills in everyday life, not just when we play a game.

Q: And how do I get there?

A: This requires two things. First and foremost, we should play games regularly to practice these skills. Not just any games, but games that are challenging for us and stretch our abilities. Research suggests 20 minutes of game play, three times a week, is plenty. But you cant play the same game every day for years. New games are key. Second, you need to develop mental habits that allow you to activate the same brain patterns we activate during gameplay. Thats what the SuperBetter method is designed to do. Its a series of seven habits you practice every day for 30 days, until being gameful feels like second nature. Our studies show that people who learn these habits and practice them for 30 days have more will power, less anxiety and depression, more self-confidence, and stronger personal relationships.



Q: You actually break down the key steps to getting better, such as: ""Battle the bad guys,"" ""Seek out quests"" and ""Make allies."" It's not hard to imagine these being helpful in healing. But ""Adopt a secret identity""? Really?

A: Secret Identity is definitely the most playful of the gameful habits! Its like a video game avatar, for your real life. You simply create a persona for yourself that represents all of the strengths you want to display in real life. It can be as simple as adopting a heroic nickname, like I did with Jane the Concussion Slayer. Designing your persona requires you to tap into your creative side, which is fun and puts you in a better mindset to solve problems effectively.

More importantly, research shows that when were under stress or facing a major obstacle, we tend to focus on our weaknesses and what were afraid of. This leads to anxiety and procrastination. A secret identity is a simple, clinically validated way to reverse this natural negativity bias. By adopting a heroic nickname for yourself, and listing that personas strengths, youre better able to focus on the real abilities and resources you have to be strong and achieve your goals. When we know our strengths, were more likely to use them. Of course, you dont have to tell anyone about your heroic persona ... thats why we call it a secret identity!

Q: Sorry to digress, but one of my favorite lines in your first book, Reality is Broken, was your assertion that World of Warcraft is the single most powerful I.V. drip of productivity ever created. Many gamers would agree, but most of us simply dont get it. We are stuck in some weird 1983 reality. An entire generation has grown up with video games  why dont we understand them at a deeper level?

A: We do understand them at a deeper level! At least, the hundreds of scientists, doctor and researchers who have spent the last decade studying the psychology and neuroscience of games understand them. Thats why I wanted to write this book. There are more than 500 peer-reviewed scientific studies of games in the footnotes for this book. There is so much more knowledge than most people realize about how to maximize the benefits of play and minimize the potential harms.

But I would say that the biggest obstacle to getting this science in the hands of the more than the 170 million people who play video games in the U.S., or the 1.73 billion people worldwide who play them, is that for decades, weve talked about video games as being escapist. When we play them, were escaping reality. But thats not true! Every game we play activates our brain, and its the same brain we have in real life as we have in the game. Over time, the games we play can change how we think and what were capable of. And its easy to maximize the benefits so the changes are positive. But to do that, we first have to accept as a society that games are not escapist. They really do change us.

The St. Louis Cardinals see the enemy every time they turn on the clubhouse TV.

Their friends and family talk about them, their fans curse them, and you cant get away from them this spring.

Its all about those Chicago Cubs.

No one in baseball is garnering more attention this spring than those lovable Cubs, who not only are heavily favored to win the National League, but capture their first World Series championship since the Theodore Roosevelt administration in 1908.

Yet, instead of being angry, or inspired to cite their four National League pennants since 2000 or their 100-win NL Central campaign of 2015, the Cardinals appear almost amused by it.

The Cubs can have all of that hype, Cardinals first baseman Matt Adams told USA TODAY Sports. They can get all of that spotlight. Now, lets see if they can back it up.

Were going into this like every other year, preparing to play deep into October.

Most of these Cardinals have no idea what its like to play a regular-season schedule and immediately head home. Theyve earned postseason berths five consecutive years, won three consecutive NL Central titles, and reached the World Series four times in the last 12 years. Theyve had just one losing season since the turn of the century.

Its unchartered territory, at least for me, Cardinals third baseman Matt Carpenter said. Since Ive been here, weve always been the team to beat. Its been our division. People are always coming to get us.

Now, everybodys real high on the Cubs. We get that. But it will be interesting to see how the Cubs handle that expectation.

All I know is that we feel great about ourselves.

Now, we get a chance to do some hunting.

The Cardinals certainly understand the hype surrounding the Cubs. They are Americas darlings. They ended the Cardinals season when they knocked them out in the playoffs for the first time in storied rivalry. The Cubs won 97 games last year, and after stealing outfielder Jason Heyward and starter John Lackey from the Cardinals and signing second baseman Ben Zobrist, they may even be better.

Manager Joe Maddons creative spring training antics only earn more attention.

The Cubs have rightfully earned their hype, Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright said. But now it comes down to going out and play, and seeing what happens. But whether people pick us there or not, it makes no difference.

We expect to win.

Does he share some of his teammates views that the Cubs could crumble under the weight of surreal expectations, leaving them as the next Washington Nationals?

Im not going to even think about the Cubs, Wainwright said. Those Cubs fans love to have me put words in (their) mouths, so they can send me mean tweets and stuff.

Im going to stay out of that, and just talk about the Cardinals.

The Cardinals will tell you theyre better than a year ago, too, even after the season-ending loss of starter Lance Lynn (Tommy John surgery) , and shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who could miss the entire first half with a torn thumb ligament.

It barely fazes them, not after what they endured a year ago.

The Cardinals won 100 games it in spite of Wainwright making only four starts. They did with left fielder Matt Holliday missing 89 games and hitting just four home runs. They did it with Adams missing 102 games and driving in 24 runs. And they did it with outfielder Randal Grichuk missing 45 games with two DL stints.

They won 100 games, Cubs president Theo Epstein said, and probably lost another 15 wins to injuries.

Yet, they now feel like a rusted mini-van in a parking lot full of Mercedes Benzes. It would have been different if ace David Price didnt turn down their $180 million and head to Boston. They offered Heyward $200 million only to be rejected when he went to the Cubs.

The Cardinals swallowed their pride, put their money back in their wallets, and instead wound up with starter Mike Leake, backup catcher Bryan Pena, Japanese reliever Seung Hwan, and infielder Jedd Gyorko.

Just because people dont expect us to be good, Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said, we expect ourselves to be good. Really, our expectations are high as ever.

The Cardinals will tell anyone who wants to listen that they may have the finest bullpen in the National League, anchored by Trevor Rosenthal. They say that Holliday, who may be playing first base as well as the outfield, looks like a man on a mission (Hes going to have a ridiculous year, manager Mike Matheny says.) They may not have the household names outside the 314 area code, but the Cardinals insist that rolling with young outfielders Steven Piscotty and Randal Grichuk was a better solution than shelling out money in the free-agent market for Justin Upton, Alex Gordon and Yoenis Cespedes.

Signing free agents is a great thing sometimes, Wainwright said, but our front office did exactly what they should have done. They offered a lot of money to a few guys, and when it didnt work out, you trust your young guys. Those guys have the ability to be big-name free agents in a few years, too.

Grichuk, 24, who will always be remembered as the player selected one spot ahead of Mike Trout by the Los Angeles Angels, produced an .877 OPS with 47 extra-base hits last season - second-most by any rookie despite half the at-bats. He was the first Cardinals rookie since Johnny Mize in 1936 to have at least 23 doubles, seven triples and 17 homers.

Piscotty, 25, called up on July 21, made an immediate impact on the Cardinals, hitting .305 with a .393 batting average with runners in scoring position. And outfielder Tommy Pham proved he could play in the big leagues last year after his call-up when he delivered 17 extra-base hits in 153 at-bats.

In all truthfulness, Carpenter said, we have just as many young, good up-and-coming positon players as the Cubs do, but we just dont have as much hype as they do. These guys are big-time players that dont get the same notoriety as Kris Bryant or Kyle Schwarber, but theyre right there with them.

If the Cardinals young outfield plays up to their potential, if Holliday stays healthy, if Molinas surgically repaired thumb is fully recovered, if Wainwright once again is a Cy Young candidate, maybe its premature to map out the Cubs parade route.

Just because the Cubs loaded up like they did, says second baseman Kolten Wong, doesnt mean were not good.

It takes a special team to win 100 games, and that team is still here. Well be ready for em.

But how can you celebrate your week off from college without going broke?

Two-thirds of college students said they planned to spend $500 or more on spring break in 2015, according to a study by Study Breaks College Media and FlipKey. And 44% of college students plan to take a spring break trip this year, according to estimates from CheapTickets.com.

If youre one of those who will be leaving your campus behind for a week, use these four tips to save money on your spring getaway.

Do something different

You dont have to jet to the Bahamas to enjoy your time off. If youre tight on funds, try something a little more original (and affordable).

Keep your costs to a minimum by forgoing the plane rides and hotel stays. Consider taking a road trip, going camping, spending time at a free festival, or making a day trip to a local attraction. Or you can visit a national park. Through March, a seven-day entrance pass for Californias Yosemite National Park starts at only $25.

Look for travel deals

Sometimes flying is unavoidable. If thats the case, plan accordingly.

According to mobile airfare analysis application Hopper, weekdays are the best days to fly. We found that generally, Tuesday is the cheapest day to depart this spring, the company said in a recent report. It adds that Monday to Wednesday departures are as much as 25% cheaper than Thursday to Saturday departures.

To lower costs, book your flight as early as possible. And use online travel sites such as Travelocity and Expedia to monitor prices before booking.

As for hotels, check Groupon. The sites Spring Break headquarters promises to help travelers make a break for it with discounts on stays at beachfront resorts, mountain lodges and other destinations.

Cut daily costs

From that morning cup of Starbucks to dinner at a fancy restaurant and all of the souvenir shopping in between, spring break trips can rack up quite the bill.

You cant avoid most of these purchases completely, but you can save money on them. Heres how:

Sign up for a free website that lets you earn cash back  which you can later redeem via a check or PayPal credit  on spending at restaurants, department stores and other retailers. Ebates.com is one such website.

Use the free GasBuddy app to find the cheapest prices on gas wherever you may be.

Download the free RetailMeNot app to receive the latest coupons and discounts.

Keep your student ID handy. Many businesses  including restaurants and movie theaters  offer student discounts for college kids.

Go in groups

Planning a spring break excursion with your friends isnt just more fun, its also more affordable.

Banding together lets you split gas costs or the expense of renting an Airbnb. Spend nights cooking or barbecuing together to avoid paying for meals out.

You might also be able to find group discounts on some activities, such as mini-golf or skiing. Businesses often offer a free ticket if youre purchasing multiples or an overall discount for group packages. Inquire about group rates before you book.

NEW YORK  Before lighting a candle on the bull markets seventh birthday today, how about a quick glance back at what things looked like in 2009?

Nobody knew at the time, but that was the day the U.S. stock markets worst bear market since the Great Depression finally hit bottom.

Compared to this bull market, that bear market was relatively short at less than a year-and-a half.

But its incredible just how much damage a full-blown financial crisis  one that required federal bailout of the banking system and extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve  can do to stocks in that time.

To put it lightly, things were bleak on March 9, 2009:

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed at 6,547 that day. That was 7,617 points below its then-record close on Oct. 9, 2007  a nearly 54% drop. It also was the Dows lowest close since April 14, 1997.

 The benchmark Standard & Poors 500 index was doing even worse, down nearly 57% from its October 1997 record and lowest close since Sept. 12, 1996.

 The Nasdaq composite was down almost 56% from its 2007 peak. That was its lowest close since Oct. 16, 2002, but only because the tech-packed index had yet to recover from the 2000-2001 Internet stock crash.

 U.S. investors had seen $11.2 trillion in stock wealth vanish since the 2007 top, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index.

So while celebrating how far it has come, maybe a quick round of applause for what this bull ended.

usatoday.com,2012-05-01 00:00:00,Tumblr v. Pinterest  which is right for you?,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Marguerite Happe', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Flickr, Tumblr, Pinterest, Foursquare, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Myspace  and the list goes on.

The number of social media sites today is truly incredible. In terms of sheer variety, any college student can find a social media platform to meet their specific needs, whether that is to gain inspiration for a wedding, make business connections or drive traffic to their blog.

In terms of visual micro-blogging or social bookmarking websites, Pinterest and Tumblr have taken center stage as image-driven organizational centers for billions of images, categorized and curated by each user to create their individual profile.

While Pinterests rapid rise to stardom has reached a plateau this month compared to December through February, the average Pinterest user spends 98 minutes per month on the site and Tumblr users spend an average of 2.5 hours per month tumbling, according to Comscore.

Looking at the functions of each website, its easy to see that they have extremely similar uses as well as speak to an audience of users with comparable needs for their social media sites.

So as college students with limited time for site maintenance, which is worth the while?

When Bridget McQuillan, a graphic design major at Creighton University, discovered Pinterest, she immediately began using it more frequently than Tumblr for her photography and typography inspiration.

While I still love to use Tumblr, I find myself using it more to look at pictures and quotes when Im bored, while Pinterest is more of a tool I use frequently, she said. If I find anything interesting online, I go straight to my bookmarks and pin what I see to my design inspiration board on Pinterest...its probably the best thing Ive done all year.

McQuillan is not alone in her preference for the easy organization found on Pinterest compared to the overwhelming amount of information and images on Tumblr.

Liz Welle, a public relations major at the University of Minnesota, no longer updates her Tumblr but continues to prefer using her Pinterest for personal use as well as to drive traffic to her blog.

Pinterest and Tumblr are a great example of how visually oriented people are becoming, Welle explains. Im a very visual person as well, so I was naturally drawn to Pinterest...I dont use Tumblr anymore, but I follow roughly two hundred of them. Its a great discovery tool.

While Tumblr and Pinterest are similar, there are a few key differences that distinguish the websites: Pinterest is exclusively visual content such as pictures and printed posters that can be either uploaded by the user or re-pinned; the majority of users tend to utilize the latter.

Content published on Tumblr can vary from photographs to audio clips to quotes or even plain text and links. Essentially, Tumblr offers a larger variety of options to publish content whereas the appeal of Pinterest is in the organization.

Every Pinterest page is identical. Though users can create their own unique boards to pin on the page, general layout will be the same for each user. Tumblr users have the option to create original themes, meaning each page is completely individualized.

For some students such as Parker Mullins, a business student at the University of Minnesota, neither site is worth the time it requires to maintain.

The content on Pinterest and Tumblr just isnt what I am looking for; so little of it is original and there is no dialogue to go along with it  no perspective, no opinion, Mullins said. People just re-pin or re-blog with very little thought as to why it matters...I stick mostly to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Pinterest and Tumblr fulfill different needs; use of the sites will vary from user to user based on which one contains more qualities that the user is looking for in a social media site.

For students looking to create an easy-to-maintain blog, Tumblr will be the answer due to the abundance of medium options available on the site and the amount of text that can be published.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 21:51:07+00:00,Brock Osweilers huge contract is proof the NFL has a QB shortage,"['Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Andrew Joseph']","There is a quarterback crisis in the NFL.

How do I know? Just look at what the Houston Texas did on Wednesday. They reportedly spent $72 million over four years  with $37 million of that guaranteed  on Brock Osweiler, the now-former Broncos quarterback with seven starts in a four-year career.

Im no general manager, but that seems like an awful lot of money to pour into a small sample size, one that the Broncos seemed just fine with letting go.

But thats the state of the NFL today. In the same month we watched Peyton Manning ride off into the sunset, weve talked about how the Eagles overpaid Sam Bradford, why the Broncos now need Colin Kaepernick and how the Jets would be nuts to let Ryan Fitzpatrick walk. Thats the same 33-year-old who may sign with his seventh NFL team this month. Thats right  a journeyman coming off his best year is now one of the leagues hottest commodities.

If you havent realized it already, theres just not enough talent to go around, so of course NFL franchises are more than happy to overpay for mediocrity.

Look ahead to next season and, suddenly, things seem grim under center. There are arguably only four big stars (Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers and Andrew Luck). Then theres the next tier filled with talented-but-rapidly-aging names (including Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees and Carson Palmer) and quarterbacks like Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Derek Carr and Blake Bortles who you hope will take the next step forward.

Then? It feels like its pretty much everybody else, a list too long to write, filled with flawed or inexperienced QBs.

What does that mean? It could be another year dominated by a talented defense (yes, we all know what Cam Newton did, but lets also remember what the Broncos D did to him in the Super Bowl) with a game manager under center.

In an ideal world, that sounds a lot like the possible route for ... the Texans? Maybe they do know what theyre doing after all.",[]

SIMI VALLEY, Calif.  Mourners gathered at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday to pay their last respects to former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died Sunday in Bel Air at age 94.

Flowers lined the entrance to the Simi Valley compound on Wednesday morning, before the arrival of Reagan's motorcade.

Reagan will lie in repose at the library on Wednesday and Thursday before a funeral service Friday.

The visitation is open to the public Wednesday and Thursday.

The first person lined up for the visitation was Oxnard resident Warren Weston, who said Nancy Reagan ""harkens back to an era when we all got along.""

Weston and about 75 people had lined up to take a shuttle to the library about two hours before visitation was slated to begin.

Dimitri Thomas also lined up. He said he's been a fan of Reagan since her Hollywood days as actress Nancy Davis. His favorite film was , in which she costarred in with Ronald Reagan.

The funeral, which is not open to the public, begins at 2 a.m. ET Friday.

About 1,000 invited guests are expected at the funeral, including President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and President Lyndon Johnson's daughters, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson.

Other announced mourners expected to attend are Katie Couric, Newt Gingrich, Chris Matthews, Wayne Newton and Mr. T, who was involved in helping Reagan with public service announcements during the first lady's ""Just Say No"" anti-drug campaign in the 1980s.

Daughter Patti Davis, dressed in black, greeted about 20 family members and close friends upon arrival at a Santa Monica mortuary where a 20-minute service was presided over by the Rev. Stuart Kenworth, The Associated Press reported. Attendees included the children of Ronald Reagan's son, Michael, and Dennis Revell, the widower of the former president's late daughter Maureen.

Nancy Reagan's casket was then carried by pallbearers that included members of her Secret Service detail to the hearse before it headed to the library.

Reagan will be buried alongside her husband on the library's grounds following Friday's funeral service.

Family and friends of former first lady Nancy Reagan attend a memorial service in Santa Monica, California on Wednesday. The funeral service is scheduled for Friday. (March 9) AP

Not all of them are cheap, but the right fantasy picks could wind up being huge bargains.

Here are the best fantasy baseball sleeper and breakout picks for 2016.

Breakout players



Well-known players set to join the top ranks

OF Gregory Polanco, Pittsburgh Pirates

Second-half power increase revealed his upside: 15-plus home runs, 30-plus stolen bases.

3B Maikel Franco, Philadelphia Phillies

Wrist injury derailed big rookie debut. Primed to reach 30 homers in a full season.

2B Rougned Odor, Texas Rangers

Just 22 years old, so will need polish, but a 20-20 candidate in a great environment.

3B Miguel Sano, Minnesota Twins

As long as you can deal with bottom-rung batting average, he could give you 35 homers.

FANTASY BASEBALL DRAFT GUIDE: Award-winning advice

2B/SS Addison Russell, Chicago Cubs

Hitting eighth or ninth might limit his steals, but few middle-round middle infielders have a 20-bomb profile with growth opportunity.

SP Raisel Iglesias, Cincinnati Reds

The Cuban imports filthy arsenal found its groove during his second-half rotation stay.

SP Lance McCullers, Houston Astros

Expected innings cap forces caution, but big-time skills deserve a buy, as long as hes not your SP1 or 2.

OF David Peralta, Arizona Diamondbacks

Ready to add more home runs and steals to a foundation he laid last year.

OF Randal Grichuk, St. Louis Cardinals

Another power-first piece who could leave the yard 30 times in a full year.

SP Taijuan Walker, Seattle Mariners

4.56 ERA masked drool-inducing 8.33 K/9, 2.12 BB/9, big fastball. Post-hype mantra applies.

Sleepers

Known players typically cheaper than the Breakout tier who also have tools to have a big 2016

SP Carlos Rodon, Chicago White Sox

A notable decrease in walks could make him a top-20 fantasy arm.

OF Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins

Another post-hype pick. Buy 20-plus steals, assuming 500-plus plate appearances. Health could push him toward double-digit homers, too.

OF Michael Conforto, New York Mets

Platoon risk, but he hits the ball hard, and at 23, his power already a great foundation tool.

C J.T. Realmuto, Miami Marlins

Potential 15-15 production from a catcher should have more hype than this.

FANTASY BASEBALL RANKINGS: Top 200

2B/3B Brett Lawrie, Chicago White Sox

Hows he only 26 years old? Return to awesome hitters park should minimize grounder trend. 20 HR a good bet.

3B Nick Castellanos, Detroit Tigers

Makes square contact and launched 11 HR in July, Aug. At 24, upward trajectory looks explosive.

1B/OF Wil Myers, San Diego Padres

Wrist health key, but could total 20 HR, 15 SB. Vet is just 25.

SP Joe Ross, Washington Nationals

Elite slider carried his 2015: 3.64 ERA, 8.10 K/9, 2.47 BB/9. Even only 150 innings of him could top other middle-rounders.

2B/3B Jonathan Schoop, Baltimore Orioles

The hackers .279 average from 2015 will crater. Still, 20-30 HR remain in play for a full 2016.

SS Ketel Marte, Seattle Mariners

Quick bat, feet make .280, 25-plus steals plausible.

OF Stephen Piscotty, St. Louis Cardinals

Though not great at one tool, hes a more complete hitter than fellow blue-chipper Grichuk.

SP Aaron Nola, Philadelphia Phillies

Not elite with strikeouts, but sound control and approach underrated in the grand scheme.

2B/SS/OF Brad Miller, Tampa Bay Rays

All but locked into the shortstop job, his extrapolated historical production puts him on track for 15-15 or better.

Sleepers for saves

Hunter Strickland, San Francisco Giants

Kevin Quackenbush, San Diego Padres

Corey Knebel, Milwaukee Brewers

Tony Zych, Seattle Mariners

If you have a long layover at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, you could combat your boredom with overpriced bitterballen and stroopwafels at the unimaginatively named Dutch Kitchen, or you could actually head into the city and try an improved menu of food and drinks, all while accompanied by an Amsterdam resident. KLM, the country's flagship carrier, has launched a Layover with a Local program, which pairs travelers who have at least six hours to kill with a local who's willing to show them around the city.

What's the catch? Other than a willingness to endure some awkward small talk (""So...what do you do for, um, fun and stuff?""), travelers 18 and older who want to participate must fly KLM from the U.S., Canada or Italy between March 22 and May 31 and they must have an iOS device to register on the Layover with a Local app. (Sorry, Android-ers  you're stuck at the Dutch Kitchen). Find other rules on this FAQ.

KLM will pay for you to take a high-speed train from Schiphol to the Amsterdam city center  and it's also springing for the first round of drinks when you and your local raise your glasses together. After that, the two of you can decide what you do with your remaining time  and whether you'll stay in touch after you say tot ziens and head back to your boarding gate.

Michael van den Brande, a strategist at Achtung!, the Dutch advertising agency that came up with the idea, told Adweek:

""The local recruitment campaign is focused on groups that have an intrinsic motivation to meet up with a traveler. For example, we're targeting language students so they can practice their Italian with a native speaker. And we're tapping into the expat community because we feel like they might enjoy showing their new home to someone from their home country. The app facilitates this matchmaking by linking people with similar languages and interests.""

KLM isn't the first airline to encourage travelers to get out of the airport and explore the city. In February, Icelandair launched its own Stopover Buddy program, which pairs travelers with an Icelandair employee who will show them a good time, based on their interests. The free service allows Icelandair passengers to spend their stopover (the airline allows for stopovers up to seven days without any additional airfare costs) with a Stopover Buddy selected from one of six categories: Adventure, Culture, Food, Health, Lifestyle and Nature. The Stopover Buddy program is available through April 30.

And wow, its strange.

At around the 24-second mark, Menzl described a foul but seemed confused near the end of his sentence. That was because a game official was yelling at him.

We can hear referee Pat Adams scream, Whos this right here? Whos this right here?

Menzl went on with calling the game, but the official asked for a game manager to throw Menzl out.

It truly was surreal to listen to as Menzl kept his cool and continued to do his job while arguing his case to the ref.

But I didnt even do anything, Menzl said.

Apparently, Adams was unhappy with a gesture Menzel made and thought he was being shown up.

Menzel explained what happened to the Green Bay Press-Gazette:

Menzl said Adams thought he was waving him off after a call went against the Phoenix. I talk with my hands, Menzl said. I was trying to describe that we had two guys fighting for the ball, and he took it as I waved him off, like saying thats a horrible call. At first he gave me a warning. Then two seconds later said, I want this guy removed and I wont start the game until he gets removed.

Menzl was replaced by the Oakland radio announcer for a couple minutes before he was allowed to return to the game.

It was a complete misunderstanding, but Adams needed to chill. There is nothing worse in college hoops than an official who makes the game about him or her. It was the semifinal of a conference tournament, and Adams was so petty as to delay the game in order to have a radio announcer removed.

Good on Menzl for handling that odd situation like a pro.",[]

SAN FRANCISCO  Square shares rose 3.7% in after hours trading Wednesday after the San Francisco-based point-of-sale company delivered its first quarterly financial report after going public in November.

Square lost 34 cents per share  or 20 cents, taking out the impact of stock dividend issued when it went public  on revenue of $374 million, it reported.

The results missed Wall Street expectations on earnings but beat on revenue.

The consensus estimate from S&P Global Market Intelligence was for a loss of ten cents per share on revenue of $344.74 million.

Square has a high profile both because it has first-mover advantage in the point-of-sale market and also because of it chief executive, Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter Inc.

Square (SQ) shares rose 37 cents to $12.40 in after-hours trading Wednesday.

Square's revenue rose 49% year-over-year, including sales from a payment processing deal with Starbucks, which it plans to let expire in the third quarter.

Its net loss widened to $80 million, including the dividend cost, from $37 million in the year ago quarter.

Square reported that gross payment volume increased 47% year-over-year to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter.

The company has also received over 350,000 pre-orders for its new contactless and chip card reader, it said.

Square's guidance for the first quarter of 2016 was for adjusted revenue of $132 million to $137 million, which strips out the impact of the Starbucks deal.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 23:28:30+00:00,Fantasy football free agency tracker: A look at the biggest NFL moves,"['Cory Bonini', 'Hours Ago', 'Herija Green', 'Usa Today Fantasy Sports', 'Steve Gardner']","NFL free agency opens March 9, and all of this player movement undoubtedly remodels the world of fantasy football. The biggest moves of the open market elicit these early evaluations.

QB Brock Osweiler, Houston Texans

4-year, $72 million contract

Perhaps a shocker to some, but the writing was on the wall when Denver switched back to Peyton Manning late last season, thus allowing Osweiler to have all the leverage.

The Texans have a primo wideout in DeAndre Hopkins and a competent game plan. Osweilers early success depends on assimilation and talent  he has some, for sure, but seven career starts make it difficult to gauge where he fits in.

Its likely as a glorified game manager with that strong defense  and newcomer Lamar Miller at running back  taking off some pressure. Osweiler is a modest QB2 target who figures to be overvalued in casual leagues.

RB Doug Martin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

5-year, $35.7 million contract

The NFLs second leading rusher finished with 1,402 yards and six scores in 2015s resurgent season, and his once-questionable return to the Buccaneers is now an afterthought.

Mileage and injury history are major sticking points for assessing his 2016 worth, but based on his merits, Martin warrants second-round RB1 consideration. Hes a higher pick in standard scoring than non-PPR.

RB Matt Forte, New York Jets

Contract details undisclosed

Age (30) and a yeomans workload diminish Fortes fantasy prospects. If third-down back Bilal Powell doesnt return to the Jets, we can safely say Forte at least has that role pinned down. The Jets are an older team, and should the team re-sign Ryan Fitzpatrick, New York appears to be in a win-now mode.

Forte is a reasonable No. 2 running back in point-per-reception leagues and a weaker version of that in standard setups.

RB Lamar Miller, Houston Texans

4-year, $26 million contract

Miamis coaching staff never seemed to know how to properly utilize the explosive back, so he opted to take his talents away from South Beach.

In Houston, Miller will probably see the majority of the touches. He profiles as a home run hitter, rather than a workhorse, goal line threat or third-down back. Some combination of Alfred Blue, Akeem Hunt and/or Jonathan Grimes will contend for spell duties. Miller is a high-ceiling second fantasy back with RB1 offerings in the right scenario.

WR Marvin Jones, Detroit Lions

5-year, $40 million contract

The retirement of Calvin Johnson meant the Lions desperately needed to address the position, so the consensus top wide receiver available was a good place to start.

Jones has the potential to do great things in Detroit, but the reality is he hasnt been exposed to a high level of pressure in the NFL. He has been shielded by A.J. Green and a run-first offensive system.

Take a chance on Jones as a third fantasy receiver, provided the hype doesnt lead to him being grossly overdrafted.

TE Coby Fleener, New Orleans Saints

5-year, $36 million contract

After Dwayne Allen re-upped with the Indianapolis Colts, the writing was on the wall for Fleeners departure.

Drew Brees now has his best tight end since, well, Jimmy Graham in 2014, but the leap from last years crop of line extensions to Fleener cannot be understated. Hes a midrange No. 1 fantasy tight end and could provide the best value at the position in 2016 drafts.

TE Ladarius Green, Pittsburgh Steelers

Contract details undisclosed

Speaking of likely to be overvalued, Green could be the poster boy in 2016 fantasy draft season. Flashes of sheer brilliance have been sprinkled in with long stretches of mediocrity and injury woes.

Some owners will remember Greens raw talent and forget his lack of consistency. Green will be one of many mouths to feed in a crowded offense. Some weeks hell shine, others hell lay goose eggs as a TE2 draft target.

TE Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers

2-year, $12 million contract

Green was once hyped as the next Antonio Gates in San Diego, but the soon-to-be 36-year-old gets the last laugh.

A Philip Rivers favorite, the elder statesman of NFL tight ends is a fringe starter and should be selected as such in traditional fantasy drafts.",[]

John Goodmans Howard Stambler character in 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely a little off, even by survivalist standards. But the guy knows how to build a doomsday bunker.

Director Dan Trachtenberg insisted on adding a line where Howard's philosophy comes through.

Howard gives a speech about other people building their ark after the flood has already come, Trachtenberg says. I really wanted that character to be, for a moment, very convincing.

Howard's underground bunker does a lot of that talking. It's a survivalist showcase worthy of Noah and serves as the setting throughout 10 Cloverfield Lane (in theaters Friday), a film that producer J.J. Abrams calls the ""spiritual successor"" to 2008 doomsday film Cloverfield.

The shelter features separate rooms, a cooking area, a shower, a recreation area, an air filtration system and some cozy touches.

Production designer Ramsey Avery says it was key to have the space feel real. Before constructing the New Orleans set, Avery and Trachtenberg consulted with bunker manufacturers and researched doomsday ""prepper"" websites.

I can only imagine what Homeland Security thinks of my Internet history, Avery says.

Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is placed in a stark room after her mysterious introduction to the bunker following a car accident. But she finds other sections of the bunker offer glimpses of Howards personality  which is colored heavily by the relationship he talks about with his estranged daughter, Megan. That explains the board games (Game of Life is a favorite) and jigsaw puzzles.

As a child, his daughter actually thought the bunker was a lot of fun, says Avery, who added a window-to-nowhere in the underground kitchen. It added a weird sense of homeyness, especially with the macaroni-and-yarn decoration Howards daughter made to put in it.

It's not suitable for the pages of a home magazine. But Howard shows effort. The main room is even wallpapered.

Thats Howards effort to make the bunker feel friendly and family-like, Avery says. Funny that the pattern he chose was bars.

The recreation area features a working jukebox, which star John Gallagher Jr. (fellow bunker-dweller Emmett) insists was possessed because of random music malfunctions at peculiar hours.

There was a rumor on the set that it was haunted, Gallagher says.

The TV is accompanied by an extensive VHS library. Titles range from Pretty in Pink (which Howard notes was his daughters favorite) to the fictitious Cannibal Airlines.

We had fun putting together that VHS collection, Trachtenberg says. And theres a serious book collection that I grew up with, Time Life books, Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton.

Goodman says he prepped for his scenes by making himself comfortable on the couch, surrounded by ""Home Sweet Home"" pillows and reading The Catcher In the Rye.

The set was built with removable walls to accommodate filming and allow the actors to take breaks outside the bunker. Nonetheless, Trachtenberg prepared by watching submarine films such as The Hunt for Red October.

I studied movies that were very contained  I wanted this to have the same feeling, says Trachtenberg.

Gallagher found unexpected benefits shooting in a bunker. His character has a cot behind the snack shelves, which means he didnt have to go far for food or rest.

My first scene, Im eating a package of Goldfish (crackers), Gallagher says. I had everything I needed right there.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Chipotle store closed for second day on Norovirus fears,"['Est March', 'Kaja Whitehouse', 'P M']","A Chipotle restaurant northwest of Boston has shut down after one of its employees fell ill. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

NEW YORK  A Chipotle in Billerica, Mass., closed its doors for a second day Wednesday after one of its employees tested positive for the highly contagious norovirus. As many as four employees are suspected to be sick with the stomach bug.

The Chipotle, located just northwest of Boston, first shut its doors Tuesday after word emerged that at least one employee had tested positive for the norovirus, which causes pain, nausea and vomiting. The store is expected to reopen Thursday on the condition that employees who come to work test negative for the virus, Richard Berube, director of the Billerica Board of Health told USA TODAY.

Chipotle will test the employees for the virus via stool sample and symptom questionnaire, Berube said.

The Mexican fast-food chain has been plagued by health issues in recent months, which has weighed on its reputation and stock price. The stock is down 20% during the last 12 months amid reports of norovirus and E.coli outbreaks.

The stock fell more than 5% early Wednesday but recovered somewhat to close at $506.63, which represents a loss of 3.4%.

""We closed the restaurant on Tuesday after four of our employees  none of whom worked while sick  called to say they were at home and not feeling well,"" Arnold said in an email. ""We look forward to opening tomorrow,"" he said.

But Berube says the store initially opened its doors on Tuesday and only closed them after he sent an inspector to the store because his office was alerted to the potential outbreak by Boston's local television news station WHDH.

Restaurants are not required to notify the Board of Health when workers have contagious illnesses, Berube told USA TODAY. ""It probably would have been in their best interest to notify us, considering they had a confirmed case of norovirus,"" he added.

In January, the company said it was served with a federal grand jury subpoena over its handling of an August norovirus outbreak in California, which sickened more than 200 people, including 18 workers. In February, the chain closed all of its stores for several hours in order to talk to employees about food safety.

Chipotle executives have pledged to improve their food-safety standards in an effort to reduce future outbreaks and instill confidence.

After learning of the health risk from the television news station, the Billerica Board of Health sent an inspector to the Chipotle store, which had already opened for business, Berube said. The inspector discussed closing the store with management, which then voluntarily agreed to close the store and take other precautionary measures, Berube said.

For example, they discarded all the food in the store and cleaned it ""from top to bottom,"" Berube said.

On Wednesday, health inspectors visited the store again. They found the store to be ""nice, clean and in great shape,"" Arnold said, a sentiment that was confirmed by Berube. ""There are no confirmed customer illnesses connected to this incident,"" Arnold said.

Within hours, Nike, one of Sharapovas major sponsors, confirmed it was suspending its ties with the newly tainted player, as did Porsche. And TAG Heuer, which had been negotiating a new contract with the tennis player, did the same, reported The New York Times.

The swift responses reignited questions about a double standard in sports and elsewhere, as male sports stars have been kept on sponsor rosters  most notably Nikes  despite a range of allegations made against them, from doping to sexual assault.

Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, said she tested positive for meldonium, a medicine she took since 2006 to address a slew of health issues that was, unbeknownst to her, she said, added to the Worlds Anti-Doping Agencys list of banned substances starting this year.

Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and players were notified of the changes in the WADA banned substances list in December, USA TODAY reports. Sharapova claimed she simply neglected to click on the link. USA TODAY also says she could face a long ban from the International Tennis Federation, possibly ending her season and preventing her from competing at the Olympics.

Sharapova took responsibility for failing to keep abreast of changes to WADAs banned substance list. Facing a suspension of indeterminate length, the Russian star said she accepted the consequences and expressed desire to get back to the game.

Sharapovas Nike affiliation, which began in her junior days, continued in 2010 with a contract reportedly worth up to $70 million. Their partnership has helped Sharapova remain the worlds highest paid female athlete for over a decade.

The sports giants quick distancing from the tennis player is remarkable given it stuck with male athletes like Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods regardless of scandal. And Twitter took note.

double standards from Nike on instantly dropping #Sharapova when they took so long to drop Lance Arsmtrong,was doping illegally for years!  Michael Page (@pagey_23) March 8, 2016

Consider the facts:

Lance Armstrong

Nike continued its partnership with Armstrong, as did Anheuser-Busch, even as evidence mounted in 2012 that the cyclist had achieved his victories through intentional doping. (Even the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency banning Armstrong for life and claiming he should be stripped of his titles didnt dissuade the sportswear giant.) Nike only distanced itself when Armstrong finally confessed to wrongdoing.

Tiger Woods

Nike kept Woods on its roster despite the golfers infidelity scandal in 2009. Others dropped him, though, including Gillette and AT&T.

Ray Rice

Although Nike did drop Rice after the Baltimore Ravens running back was proven to have committed domestic abuse, it was seven months after footage was first released showing the NFL player dragging his unconscious fiancee out of an elevator.

Kobe Bryant

Nike stood by Bryant in 2003, when an accusation of sexual assault compromised the basketball stars image.

Justin Gatlin

In March 2015, Nike gave the American sprinter an endorsement deal despite the fact that Gatlin had already been suspended, and readmitted, after a pair of doping bans, including a four-year suspension between 2006 and 2010.

Michael Vick

The Atlanta Falcons quarterback lost his Nike deal after being implicated in a dog-fighting ring in 2007. Vick spent time in prison in 2009  and Nike gave him a new contract in 2011.

In comparison to the above list, Sharapovas act of negligence doesnt appear as damning. Over her 15-year career, she has competed in 746 tour matches. Only the five matches she played this year are under the banned substance cloud (good for 0.67% of her career total).

The Russian star also dealt with her complicated situation in an honest and upfront way. She took responsibility and admitted remorse. Should Sharapova be held to standards her male counterparts arent?

For now, though, its a wait-and-see situation, as Nike has only suspended its relationship with Sharapova and not terminated it outright.

WASHINGTON  An Islamic State operative captured in Iraq told U.S. military personnel that the terrorist group had plans to use mustard gas against American allies fighting them, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.

The fighter, who was detained by U.S. special operations forces last month, has been identified by the U.S. military as a chemical weapons specialist, according to the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The weapons were going to be used against Kurdish forces and other U.S. allies, the official said. The timing of any such attack is unclear.

The captured fighter was the top ""weapons emir"" for the extremist group, according to a second Defense official, who also asked to remain unnamed because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The captive was a top chemical weapons official under Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was ousted during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and later executed, the second official said.

The group's rudimentary chemical arsenal includes chlorine and mustard gas, according to the second official. He added that as a result of intelligence gathered from the captive, the U.S. military destroyed a chemical weapons storage and mixing facility within the past week, and more operations against the Islamic State are planned.

The chemical weapons specialist was caught by a special expeditionary force of U.S. commandos sent to Iraq to conduct raids on the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, to capture or kill the group's key leaders and to free hostages. No Americans were injured in the operation, the second official said.

The detainee has helped American and allied forces learn about the Islamic State's response to pressure from the U.S.-led bombing campaign and offensives on the ground from Iraqi and Kurdish forces, the second official said.

Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq's finance minister, said he did not have information on the capture, but a number of former members of Saddam's ruling Baath Party have joined the Islamic State and are providing military expertise. ""Many of the die-hard Saddamists have joined ISIS,"" Zebari said in a telephone interview. ""They are the top ISIS military planners.""

He also praised the U.S. expeditionary force. ""These kinds of raids are very effective and demoralizing for ISIS,"" he said.

The Associated Press identified the captive as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, citing two unnamed Iraqi intelligence sources.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to comment on the matter.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 16:46:40+00:00,American League East projected batting orders,"['Steve Gardner', 'Hours Ago', 'Herija Green', 'Usa Today Fantasy Sports', 'Cory Bonini']","We should learn a great deal more about what teams plan to do on offense once spring training games begin this week. But heres our best guess at how each American League East team will line up from 1 to 9:

Baltimore Orioles

LF Hyun Soo Kim

3B Manny Machado

1B Chris Davis

CF Adam Jones

C Matt Wieters

RF Mark Trumbo

DH Pedro Alvarez

2B Jonathan Schoop

SS J.J. Hardy

Re-signing Davis was huge for this offense. The majors leading home run hitter in two of the last three years provides a needed left-handed power bat in the middle of the lineup.

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Trumbo fits best as a DH but will have to play some right field because of the teams limited depth and the recent addition of Alvarez. However, as long as hes healthy he should be a 30-homer threat at hitter-friendly Camden Yards.

Fowler would have filled another void: leadoff. Kim had an excellent on-base percentage in Korea, but it might be a bit much to ask him to take over the role right away.

Boston Red Sox

RF Mookie Betts

2B Dustin Pedroia

SS Xander Bogaerts

DH David Ortiz

1B Hanley Ramirez

3B Pablo Sandoval

LF Rusney Castillo

C Blake Swihart

CF Jackie Bradley Jr.

Betts could be one of this seasons breakout stars. He does everything well and, considering the teams overall offensive firepower, could lead the league in plate appearances and runs. Bogaerts ranked third in the majors with 196 hits last season but only seven were home runs. Hes 23, so its time to start seeing more power.

After the All-Star break, no one had more RBI (65) or a higher slugging percentage (.701) than Ortiz. His farewell tour should end with a bang. The big question is how Ramirez will adapt to playing first base. Last years move to the outfield was a disaster  offensively and defensively  so a late-game exit might happen more often than his fantasy owners would like.

Daily fantasy favorite Chris Young will start against left-handed pitchers after hitting .327 with a .575 slugging percentage against them last season.

New York Yankees

CF Jacoby Ellsbury

LF Brett Gardner

RF Carlos Beltran

1B Mark Teixeira

DH Alex Rodriguez

C Brian McCann

3B Chase Headley

SS Didi Gregorius

2B Starlin Castro

With an average age of nearly 33, this starting lineup is full of injury and health risks. Ellsbury was hampered by a sprained knee for a good part of last season. Gardner is out with a wrist injury until mid-March. Texieira missed all of September with a broken leg. And that was all before slugging young first baseman Greg Bird was lost for the season with a torn labrum.

AL East | Central | West

Rodriguez is the elder statesman at 40. Though he had a fantastic comeback season with 33 home runs, he ties up the DH spot that could be used to give the other veterans a day off in the field.

The acquisitions of Castro, 25, and Aaron Hicks, 26, are steps in the right direction. Hicks can play all three outfield positions  unfortunately, not at the same time.

Tampa Bay Rays

CF Kevin Kiermaier

2B Logan Forsythe

3B Evan Longoria

RF Corey Dickerson

LF Desmond Jennings

1B James Loney

DH Logan Morrison

C Hank Conger

SS Brad Miller

Forsythe was a godsend last year with 17 home runs and 68 RBI. The addition of Dickerson will give the lineup another power threat and provide Longoria with a bit better protection. How well Dickerson makes the transition from hitter-friendly Coors Field could be the key to this offenses success.

The Rays likely will play matchups at several spots in the lineup. Steve Pearce should spell Loney at first against lefties. Shortstop and former No. 1 overall pick Tim Beckham has shown some home run pop vs. southpaws, but Miller was acquired to be the regular starter at short.

Toronto Blue Jays

CF Kevin Pillar

3B Josh Donaldson

RF Jose Bautista

DH Edwin Encarnacion

SS Troy Tulowitzki

1B Chris Colabello

C Russell Martin

LF Michael Saunders

2B Ryan Goins

The Jays led the majors in about every offensive category last season and will have a healthy Tulowitzki from Day 1. Though he hit leadoff, Tulowitzki will move into a better run-producing spot in the order.

NL East | Central | West

The best fit at leadoff is second baseman Devon Travis, but hes recovering from shoulder surgery. Pillar and Saunders will get long looks in the role this spring with speedy prospect Dalton Pompey in the mix to start in left.",[]

During Sydneys pregnancy, the keeper staff at the Buffalo Zoo was able to monitor the babys growth using ultrasound technology, as Sydney had been trained to present her abdomen to keepers and remain calm during the ultrasound process, so she did not need to be anesthetized in order to obtain images of the fetus. The gestation period of gorillas is eight and a half months. Baby gorillas don't begin walking until between three and six months of age, and are not weaned until three. Western lowland gorillas are found in the lowland tropical forests of central Africa. The species is critically endangered due to loss of habitat as well as the bush meat trade.

Masai Giraffe - LA Zoo & Botanical Gardens

The Los Angeles Zoos animal community soared to new heights with the birth of a male Masai giraffe recently. The first baby for 4-year-old mom Zainabu, the calf weighed in at 130-pounds and was just under 6-feet-tall at birth. The baby was born at night, and Zainabu is doing a great job as a first time mother, said Mike Bona, L.A. Zoo Animal Keeper. I encourage guests to come see the calf while hes still young because they can grow to be nearly 10-feet by their first birthday. Giraffes are the tallest land mammal, and the Masai giraffes, which hail from East Africa and are the largest of the nine giraffe subspecies, can grow up to 17-feet and weigh some 2,700- pounds. All giraffe populations throughout Africa are under threat and declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal hunting, and disease.

Prehensile-tailed porcupine - Charles Paddock Zoo

On California's Central Coast, the Charles Paddock Zoo welcomed a baby prehensile-tailed porcupine with a big round nose and sharp spines to its family of hundreds of animal species from around the world, many of which are part of globally managed programs to preserve animals and their habitats. A pretty mellow little guy, zookeepers say he enjoys hanging by his tail and sleeping. He's already one of the most popular residents at the zoo.

Lions, meerkats and gibbons - Indianapolis Zoo

It was a busy fall for animals at the Indianapolis Zoo, which welcomed three lion cubs, two meerkat pups and one baby gibbon recently. The baby lions were born in the fall to mother Zuri and father Nyack. Through a naming poll on the Zoos Facebook page, the public helped choose the cubs names: Enzi, meaning powerful, and Mashaka, meaning troublemaker, for the males and Sukari, meaning sweet, for the female. Like all lion cubs, the baby lions were born with mottled fur. But overtime the dog spots will fade into a sleek golden coat. The cubs love playing with their mom, who is both caring and protective of her trio.

The zoo also welcomed Cato and Cashmere, two tiny slender-tailed meerkat pups, who were born to mother Rue in the fall. In the wild, meerkats give birth in underground burrows to help keep the newborns safe from predators. To shield them from dust in their subterranean homes, pups are born with their eyes and ears closed. The zoo's newcomers opened their eyes for the first time on their 11th day. Rue's sisters, her mate, and other males help her raise the babies (the entire family is known as a ""mob"") and Cato and Cashmere spend a lot of time exploring their exhibit and learning from the adults how to do meerkat things like digging, foraging and standing sentry.

Finally, the Indianapolis Zoo announced the birth of a white-handed gibbon, Kopi, who was born on the day before International Gibbon Day to Elliot and Koko. Kopi was the first child for the gibbon pair, and has already started singing (Gibbons sing to announce their territory and attract mates) with her parents.

African penguin chicks - Minnesota Zoo

Don't plan your trip to Minnesota Zoo just yet to see three new African penguin chicks. Currently they are just about a month old, and are being cared for behind the scenes by zookeepers. The chicks are just beginning to recognize these keepers as their caretakers, who feed them herring and capelin, both a sustainable seafood source that is comparable in nutrition to what they would be eating in the wild--sardines and anchovies, three times daily. They will make their debut on exhibit at the end of March or early April.

Flamingo chicks - Memphis Zoo

In Memphis, two Chilean flamingo chicks recently hatched. The chicks, whose sex has yet to be determined, are the first to be reared at the Memphis Zoo since 2008. The eggs were artificially incubated in the zoo hatchery and returned to their parents when the chicks started vocalizing and pipping the outer shell. The father of the older chick is 36-years-old and came to the Memphis Zoo in 1981 from the Oklahoma City Zoo. The mother is 34-years-old and came to the zoo from the Jacksonville Zoo in 1996. The flamingo flock at the Memphis Zoo now consists of 16 males, 14 females and the two new chicks.

Prehensile-tailed skink - Zoo Atlanta

Born January 12, 2016, at Zoo Atlanta, a new baby prehensile-tailed skink is the newest addition to Scaly Slimy Spectacular: The Amphibian and Reptile Experience. Unlike most reptiles, which are solitary, prehensile-tailed skinks can be found living in small social groups. Baby prehensile-tailed skinks can be as much as one-third the size of their mothers at birth. The skink is doing well and looking forward to meeting visitors inside his just-built home.

Goeldi's monkey - Palm Beach Zoo

In Palm Beach a baby monkey named Picchu was born recently. A Goeldi's monkey, which is a species known for being full of curiosity, Picchu's ancestors hail from the Upper Amazon Basin of Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia. They live in tropical rainforests in the wild and have extensive communications with other monkeys through vocalization, marking and facial and body language. Picchu is an active fellow and enjoys interacting with the members of his troop.

Silvered leaf langur - Columbus Zoo & Aquarium

The Columbus Zoo & Aquarium welcomed two silvered leaf langurs for the New Year. They were born with bright orange fur, which is normal for langurs, but as they age over the next six months their coats will being to change to black with silver tips, which is the color of adult langurs. This distinct difference in coat color is believed to encourage other female langurs to assist in raising the young, which is called allomothering. Sadly, these monkeys native to Southeast Asia are listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, due to population declines caused by habitat loss.

Bontebok calf - Cleveland Metroparks Zoo

On Christmas morning, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo welcomed a new born bontebok calf named Noel. The mother Karoo and the calf are doing great. Bontebok are an antelope species found in the coastal plains of southwestern South Africa. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, their numbers were reduced to just 17 individuals. Since reintroduction to preserves and farms, those numbers have increased to over 1,000. Bontebok can be seen on the African Savanna at the Zoo, weather permitting.

Stunned motorists who came upon the scene of energy executive Aubrey McClendon's fatal car crash Wednesday in Oklahoma City described a horrifying scene marked by the explosion of his vehicle.

Several witnesses placed emergency calls after the Chesapeake Energy co-founder and ex-CEO drove his 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe directly into an overpass, according to tapes released Thursday by the Oklahoma City Police Department.

McClendon was killed when he suddenly crossed the center line and struck the wall at a high speed, crushing his sport-utility vehicle's front end and engulfing it in flames, police said.

His death came fewer than 24 hours after he was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly conspiring to rig bids for oil and natural gas leases during his tenure at Chesapeake.

A man told a 911 dispatcher that he had witnessed the crash from about a quarter-mile away, according to tapes released to USA TODAY by Oklahoma City police department Captain Paco Balderrama.

""The accident looks pretty bad. The car looks like it might be on fire,"" the caller said. ""It looks like they swerved and hit"" the wall.

Another man who drove up to the wreck told dispatchers that the Tahoe was ""completely impacted within.""

""The cab is completely crushed. The vehicle is on fire,"" the man said.

A woman in that caller's vehicle spoke up, telling dispatchers there were ""two guys running up to the car right now.""

The man added, ""It looks like either a nurse or doctor here and the fire is really escalating.""

The dispatcher called firefighters to send someone to the scene. The Tahoe ""is almost engulfed in flames,"" she told firefighters. ""The front end is completely gone.""

Soon after that, another woman alerted dispatchers that the vehicle was ""like bursting into flames right now.""

The dispatcher called firefighters back to alert them that the ""vehicle just exploded,"" according to audio of the calls.

usatoday.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Futures higher as G20 ministers meet in Shanghai,['Jane Onyanga-omara'],"U.S. stock futures were higher Friday, as G20 financial leaders meeting in Shanghai offered mixed messages over the potential for new stimulus to stave off the risk of recession.

Heres where stock futures stood ahead of the opening bell:

Dow Jones: +0.7%

S&P 500: +0.7%

Nasdaq: +0.8%

Asian shares were mostly up after Chinas central bank governor pledged not to devalue the yuan for the sake of export competitiveness. Gains were limited however, as oil prices fell earlier and governments tried to squelch expectations the G20 meeting will produce specific growth plans.

Japans Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3% to finish at 16,188.41 while Hong Kongs Hang Seng index rose 2.5% to 19,364.15. The Shanghai composite index rose 1% to 2,767.21 after falling more than 6% Thursday.

In Europe, Germanys DAX rose 1.9%, Frances CAC 40 was 1.8% higher and Britains FTSE 100 was up 1.1%.

U.S. crude regained ground and was up 2.2% at $33.78 while Brent crude was 2.2% higher at $36.07 at around 6 a.m. ET Friday.

Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 major rich and developing economies began a two-day meeting in Shanghai on Friday. They sought to douse hopes that the summit will produce specific growth plans similar to those rolled out in 2009 in response to the global crisis. Instead, many urged faster progress on pro-growth structural reforms instead of relying on monetary and fiscal policy to boost growth.

U.S. stocks shrugged off the sell-off in Shanghai and ended higher Thursday.

To promote the upcoming crossover episode between Supergirl and The Flash, CBS has released a promo poster and it's one that we kind of want to print out and hang up behind our desks immediately.

This. Rules. (Photo: CBS)

Savvy comic book fans will recognize the cover, it's a recreation of Issue 199 of the Superman comic from 1967, by Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson. Except this time around it's Kara not Clarke who's in the lead.

Tumblr | @comicbookcovers Superman #199, August 1967, cover by Car...

CBS also released the official plot summary for the episode, called ""World's Finest,"" which explains how they are explaining the appearance of The Flash on Supergirl. As some fans have guessed, it looks like the shows take place in different universes (which makes sense since Superman isn't around on The Flash).

Kara gains a new ally when the lightning-fast superhero The Flash (Grant Gustin) suddenly appears from an alternate universe and helps Kara battle Siobhan, aka Silver Banshee, and Livewire in exchange for her help in finding a way to return him home.

And they're racing, right? They're definitely going to race? Because if they tease us with that cover and without a race we're going to be pretty devastated.

Data-storage firm Seagate Technology confirmed that it recently became the latest victim of a phishing scam that exposed tax information of its workers to digital thieves.

The company said in a statement that a Seagate employee was tricked into sending 2015 W-2 tax documents for current and former U.S. employees after receiving a phishing email  a type of nefarious digital inquiry that seeks to entice the recipient into providing access to sensitive data without realizing it.

Others recently hit by similar tax-phishing scams include social-media firm Snapchat, which apologized after certain payroll information was exposed, and The Evening Post Industries.

Phishing scams have become a serious threat to individuals and corporations, with hackers posing as friends or business contacts to gain access to lucrative or damaging information.

The Internal Revenue Services issued a public alert on March 1 about phishing schemes in which the perpetrator is posing as a company executive and requesting employees' personal information. The agency said it has noticed a 400% increase in tax-phishing scams this tax season.

This is a new twist on an old scheme using the cover of the tax season and W-2 filings to try tricking people into sharing personal data. Now the criminals are focusing their schemes on company payroll departments, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement. If your CEO appears to be emailing you for a list of company employees, check it out before you respond. Everyone has a responsibility to remain diligent about confirming the identity of people requesting personal information about employees.""

Seagate said it learned of its breach on March 1. ""The information was sent by an employee who believed the phishing email was a legitimate internal company request,"" Seagate said. ""When we learned of the incident, we immediately notified the IRS which is now actively investigating it along with federal law enforcement.""

In Snapchat's case, user information was not released. But Snapchat admitted that a phishing email posing as the company's CEO led to the breach in which ""a number of our employees have now had their identity compromised.""

At Seagate, information associated with several thousand workers was exposed, according to industry publication KrebsOnSecurity.

The Internal Revenue Service has flagged the tax information of the affected employees to watch out for fraudulent tax returns, Seagate said.

""At this point we have no information to suggest that employee data has been misused, but caution and vigilance are in order,"" Seagate said. ""We deeply regret this mistake and we offer our sincerest apologies to everyone affected. Seagate is aggressively analyzing where process changes are needed and we will implement those changes as quickly as we can.""

The company said it is offering a free two-year subscription to an identify-theft monitoring service to its employees.

Queen Tina Fey herself confirmed it in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. The actress/writer, who penned the original movie that we still obsess about more than 10 years later, said that, although they havent finished writing the musical yet, its close  yes, pretty close, joking that it will come out in 2027 (or) whenever Hamilton closes.

Why the hold up? Fey also admitted that they are having trouble figuring out when the first act should end, and what would be the big 11 oclock number. Well, if shes having issues deciding what the musical numbers should be, we at Entertain This! are very, very, very happy to help.

We present our imagined tracklist for Mean Girls: The Musical. And we are only like, 70% joking about these. They should all be songs. Wed pay to see them as songs.

1. The Limit Does Not Exist: A classic inspirational Broadway I Want song that refrains at the beginning and end of the play. Sung by Cady solo at the beginning, it becomes aMathletes group number at the end. Someone definitely lifts Cady up a la Dirty Dancing at the climax. Hoai-Tran Bui

2. Army Pants and Flip Flops: An ode to the Bethany Byrds of the world, the bubblegum pop number would be performed flash mob-style as the cast cheerleads the wannabes, who pray a new pair of camo pants and some Old Navy flip-flops will earn them the greatest achievement any high schooler could aspire to: Coolness. Jaleesa Jones

3. Why Are You White? (African Child): A consummate blend of smooth jazz and topical lyricism, this Cady Heron and Karen Smith-assisted track reflects both on Cadys milky skin and the sweeping failure of American world history classes. It invokes nostalgia of Teddy Pendergrass Turn Off The Lights, musing, Why are you white? Your skins too pale to handle. Jones

4. Butter is a Carb: A retro pop song performed in the cafeteria. The Plastics stand frozen in the middle as everyone suddenly becomes a 50s housewife. Even the guys. Bui

5. Get in Loser, Were Going Shopping: This, obviously, is Regina Georges power ballad. It is her Defying Gravity. Her Part of That World. Her Dont Rain on My Parade. It is here that she establishes her status as Queen Bee. And her gravitas. We are all losers. And we are all going shopping with her. Kelly Lawler

6. Social Suicide: The emo indie rock number sung by Janice and Damian as they run circles around a confused Cady. All the dancers in this song wear shaggy black haircuts, black T-shirts, plaid pants and chokers. Pause for the angsty guitar solo. Bui

7. You Will Get Pregnant And Die: Set in the gym. A Ya Got Trouble-style patter song by Coach Carr, where he alternates between preaching abstinence-only sex tips and hitting on all the young female students so quickly, you cant tell the difference. Maeve McDermott

8. Almost Too Gay To Function: Janis Ians guitar chord-heavy pop rock ballad pays homage to her BFF Damian and his vain attempts to get that perfect red hair. The electrifying riffs will make audiences want to belt the lyrics aloud, but remember: Its only OK when Janis sings it. Jones

9. Kevin G: A rap number sung by Kevin Gnapoor. Exactly the same as the movie. Bui

10. You Go Glen Coco: At this point in the musical we pause from the emotional drama for a short and inspirational interlude. We must cheer on Glen Coco. In the style of Stronger and Dont Stop Believing, the entire cast comes out to cheer for Glen, led by Damien. After the song is over, Gretchen Wieners gets none. Lawler

11. It Looks like Hes Headed to the Projection Room Above the Auditorium: A catchy, rhythmic montage where Cady tries, again and again and again, to get Aaron to catch Regina cheating on him. There needs to be some kind of dance when Damien steals her purse, of course. And the moment when Aaron finally catches Regina will be given great emphasis with the most theatrical tool of all: the spotlight. Lawler

12. But You Love Ladysmith Black Mumbazo!: A heartstring-tugging duet between Cadys parents as they sit around their dining room table, lamenting the loss of the daughter they once knew. The real Ladysmith Black Mumbazo come on stage halfway through and they all break into soaring 20-part harmony. McDermott

13. You Can Try Sears: A frenetic dance number set in the 1-3-5 dress store. Chorus line of lithe salesgirls surround Regina as, standing center stage, she dramatically bursts the seams of dress after dress. McDermott

14. I Did Not Leave The South Side For This: Mr. Duvalls big song, set in the high school hallways. As Burn Book chaos swirls around him, he breaks up girl fights, chases around Coach Carr and eventually just starts smashing stuff with his baseball bat, carpel tunnel be damned. McDermott

15. I Have a Lot of Feelings: An 80s pop ballad sung by that random chick at the after-school intervention, backing vocals by Damian. Think Total Eclipse of the Heart in a high school gym. Also with a modern dance interlude halfway through.  Bui

16. Ive Got a Big LESSSSSSSBIAN Crush on You!: It is time for Janice Ian to take the mic. Literally, this song should be sung with a hand-held microphone (this is a rock-musical song, like Take Me or Leave Me from Rent or And Then There Were None from Spring Awakening) as Janice simply goes in on Cady from the stage of the trust falls. Obviously it will also include the bit where the girls carry her away cheering. Lawler

17. You Look Sexy With Your Hair Pushed Back: The shows emotional coda. Set in Ms. Norburys empty classroom, Cady sings a tragic ballad about love, loss, and Aaron Samuels perfect hair. McDermott",[]

""The Lannisters send their regards.""

There's a lot of Game of Thrones that's pure fantasy, such as dragons, three-eyed ravens, giants and those creepy old White Walkers. Yet George RR Martin has also worked some real stuff into the sprawling adventure and drama of his books and HBO TV series, including his infamous ""Red Wedding"" massacre.

Out Tuesday on Blu-ray and DVD, Game of Thrones: The Complete Fifth Season lets fans catch up before new episodes begin April 24 and also features a special collection of bonus material that offers Martin and historians explaining how history has factored into Westeros mythology from the beginning.

This exclusive clip discusses the ninth episode from the third season  titled ""The Rains of Castamere""  where the wedding of Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) and Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) goes south when Walder Frey (David Bradley), the host of the occasion, perpetrates the murder of King Robb Stark (Richard Madden), his family and his men during the reception.

For inspiration, Martin pulled from two incidents that occurred in Scotland centuries ago: ""The Black Dinner"" of 1440, where a dispute with 10-year-old King James II led to the deaths of two important members of the powerful Clan Douglas, and the 1692 Glencoe massacre, where guests of the MacDonald clan slaughtered 38 of their hosts  though with the ""Red Wedding,"" Martin admits he reversed that.

Adds the writer: ""Scottish history is an amazing source for all of this because it's one of the most incredibly bloody histories of any country that I've ever studied.""

Theyve won gold, kissed their loved ones and partied all night. Now what? USA TODAY has the scoop on what this years Oscar winners have set their sights on next.

LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, 'The Revenant' (best actor)

DiCaprio is keeping his next big role under his hat for now. Though the actor hasn't formally announced his plans, he is working on a new environmental documentary.

MARK RYLANCE, 'Bridge of Spies' (best supporting actor)

Rylance bested Sylvester Stallone in the first major upset of Oscar night. The three-time Tony Award-winning actor will re-team with Steven Spielberg on this summer's fantasy adventure The BFG, a Roald Dahl adaptation about a girl who encounters a big, friendly giant (played by Rylance). Here's a peek at the teaser trailer.

BRIE LARSON, 'Room' (actress)

Larson is a champ, having balanced heavy awards-season duties with shooting the King Kong origin story Kong: Skull Island (2017) in Australia with Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson. (We imagine she slept mostly on trans-Atlantic planes.) Next up could be another Oscar-worthy performance: Larson is attached to star in The Glass Castle, based on the best-selling memoir by Jeannette Walls. (Jennifer Lawrence was once set to star.)

A big night for Brie Larson! She won best actress for her work in 'Room.' (Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images)

ALICIA VIKANDER, 'The Danish Girl' (supporting actress)

Youll be seeing a lot more of Vikander over the next year. The Danish Girl winner has been busy filming Jason Bourne with Matt Damon during awards season (and we'd bet she'll be in the next trailer). Shell wrap that project in March, then release the period drama Tulip Fever later this year (this time, instead of playing an artist, shes the subject of oil works by Christoph Waltzs character). Finally, The Light Between Oceans, about a couple raising a baby rescued at sea, will likely arrive late 2016. Fun fact: She met beau Michael Fassbender on that shoot.

TOM MCCARTHY, 'Spotlight' (screenplay)

Having directed this year's best picture winner, and with a win for original screenplay on his hands, Tom McCarthy (who wrote the film with Josh Singer) is heading to Netflix. This summer, he's directing a new series with Selena Gomez, ""based on a book called 13 Reasons Why, which deals with teen suicide and bullying,"" he told USA TODAY on the red carpet. How did that project come about? ""They sent me a script  its meaningful material wrapped in a great story. I know Im going to make another movie, and that takes some time, so this is something I could jump into and be creative and hopefully have some fun.""

Asif Kapadia, 'Amy' (documentary)

The British filmmaker is switching gears from documentaries this year (he's also behind the acclaimed racing documentary Senna), releasing the World War I love story Ali & Nino, which Kapadia premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. Its important to keep the audience on their toes, he told us last month. You cant just keep repeating yourself.""

Extensions for Google's Chrome web browser are sometimes fun, sometimes very productive, and in one instance, can lead to arguably the greatest media correction ever.

But there was one small problem: any references in the story to Donald Trump were replaced with ""Someone With Tiny Hands."" Cue the greatest correction ever:

""Due to an oversight involving a haphazardly-installed Chrome extension during the editing process, the name Donald Trump was erroneously replaced with the phrase Someone With Tiny Hands when this story originally published,"" reads the correction.

On the bright side, author Jason Tanz appears to taking this with a sense of humor:

The extension, called Make America's Hands Tiny Again, replaces all references to Trump with the quote ""Someone With Tiny Hands,"" a nod to a joke about the size of Trump's hands.

It's one of many Chrome extensions that will replace text on the Web with something meant to be humorous, such as the classic ""Millennials to Snake People,"" which replaces the world Millennials with Snake People in all text.

First day on the Dad Rock road trip was a looooong one. We set off from the USA TODAY offices in Northern Virginia at 7 a.m. ET, with Lucy the Airstream in tow, made minimal stops (coffee, gas and down-home cooking at Judy's Family Diner in Wytheville, Va.) and rolled into Asheville around 5 p.m.

First impressions: Asheville is an eclectic oasis. Seems like every storefront is a local business just dripping in character. Very artsy. A perfect environment for music to flourish.

We met up with Emily Patrick, entertainment reporter for the Asheville Citizen-Times (part of the USA TODAY NETWORK), who served as our tour guide for the evening. We visited:

Appalachian Strings, run by a local craftsman who makes his type of instrument that is a variation on the dulcimer.

Asheville FM, an independent community radio station (and host Tom Peters put us on air!).

And the Grey Eagle, which has been one of Asheville's top live music venues for 22 years (caught some of the Luther Dickinson show and got an impromptu interview too; audio coming soon).

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Marcia Clark has able advocate in 'People v. O.J.'s' Sarah Paulson,"['Est March', 'Bill Keveney', 'P M']","Sarah Paulson and Christian Clemenson play prosecutors Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman in FX's 'The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.' (Photo: Ray Mickshaw, FX)

As a lawyer, Marcia Clark would probably admire the advocacy skills of Sarah Paulson, the actress who plays her in FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story (Tuesday, 10 p.m. ET/PT).

Paulson, known for roles in American Horror Story, Carol and 12 Years a Slave, offered viewers a tour de force in this week's ""Marcia,Marcia, Marcia"" episode, which showed the lawyer trying to withstand criticism of everything from her legal performance to her physical appearance during the 1990s trial. Paulson's Clark determinedly plows through, but shows a raw, very human side when she briefly buckles under the pressures of a fishbowl existence.

The actress says Clark, who prosecuted Simpson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, received unfair criticism, much of it because she is a woman.

""She was painted as being an aggressive, ambitious, strident bitch  with a bad haircut on top of it. She may have had a bad haircut, but why we were all discussing it to the lengths we were and why it was such a headline story, I still don't understand,"" Paulson tells USA TODAY.

Clark is ""a woman who has an enormous amount of integrity, who was trying to have justice served for these two victims,"" she says. News coverage of ""her physical appearance ... is a huge communication about the sexism that was so prevalent around this person. If there were a man who was lead prosecutor and he wore a suit that no one thought was good or had a bad haircut or was aggressive or ambitious, nobody would find that troubling at all. They would say, 'Look at him go!' ""

As for Clark's skills, Paulson says: ""I think shes a great lawyer, a ferocious lawyer. What she wasnt at that time was interested in showboating. She wasn't interested in having the case play out in the court of public opinion. Unfortunately, that's where the trial was actually happening.""

Paulson's views of Clark changed dramatically as she became immersed in the limited series, which is based on Jeffrey Toobin's book, The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson. She hopes viewers will see the lawyer differently, too.

""A lot of us were fed a particular narrative from the news media,"" she says. ""I didn't know she had two very young children. I didn't know she was going through a custody and a divorce battle during the trial while she was trying to amass all this information and get ready for court each day. Getting divorced is a traumatic experience for anyone, and if you're doing that while trying to put a man you believe is a murderer behind bars, I don't know how she did it.""

Paulson disputes those who say Clark, who was joined at the prosecution table by Christopher Darden (Sterling K. Brown), lost the case, which ended in Simpson's acquittal.

""The climate in the City of Los Angeles post-Rodney King, O.J. Simpson's name, (detective) Mark Fuhrman's shocking, racist comments that were caught on tape and some of the shoddy work done by the L.A. Police Department at that time was a perfect storm that I don't think anyone could have been victorious against,"" she says.

Paulson sat down with Clark late in production.

""I did meet her when we were very close to the end of filming. She is an extraordinary woman. I feel honored that I got to meet her,"" she says. ""She was so lovely and encouraging and kind about me and my work. She hadn't seen anything (of O.J.), but she had known me from American Horror Story, which, of course, shocked me and made me feel excited.""

Justin Trudeau,"['Est March', 'Mary Bowerman', 'P M']","The charismatic Canadian prime minister has won hearts over his progressive policies and easy charm. Trudeau hopes to capitalize on the attention to focus ""on substance."" Video provided by Newsy Newslook

It may be cold in Canada this time of year, but the Canadian prime minister is bringing the heat to Washington.

Justin Trudeau, landed in Washington this week, marking the first official state visit of a Canadian Prime Minister in almost 20 years.

And while Trudeau and President Obama plan to discuss a wide-range of topics including ISIL and climate change, when it comes to Trudeau on social media, the only thing people really want to know is: Who is this man? And why is he so dang hot?

Dad was trying to explain Justin Trudeau to me, going, ""you know, he's very handsome,"" and I said, ""yeah yeah I know when someone is hot.""  fran hoepfner (@franhoepfner) March 7, 2016

justin trudeau is so hot damn  mariah (@empiresrecords) March 7, 2016

I mean Justin Trudeau is hot like ya gotta say  cat (@vampiresweeknd) March 7, 2016

Here are five things to know about Trudeau:

1. This isn't Trudeau's family's first time at the political rodeo. He is the son of long-serving former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. In October, Trudeau led his Liberal Party to a sweeping victory over the Conservatives in October to claim the office his father held for a record number of years.

2. He's vocal about women's rights and equality for gays and lesbians. And he's not scared of the f-word.

""We shouldn't be afraid of the word 'feminist,' "" Trudeau recently said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""Men and women should use it to describe themselves anytime they want.""

I am a feminist. Im proud to be a feminist. #upfordebate  Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) September 21, 2015

3. He wants a Canadian woman to be featured on a bank note. In a nod similar to the push for a woman on U.S. currency, Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau recently announced that a new bank note will be issued in 2018 that will feature an ""iconic Canadian woman.""

4. He has three young children with his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau. Sophie is known for her career in television in Canada and mirrors her husband in the battle for equality for women, Yahoo News reported.

We still face social injustice, violence,"" she told Katie Couric. ""We are denied most basic rights because we are women, and to me, that is completely unacceptable.""

5. While many are just discovering Trudeau, he's actually been #totallyadorbs since he was a child. Here's a young Trudeau at a movie as proof:

Welcome to D.C., Prime Minister!

usatoday.com,2011-02-11 00:00:00,Top 10 tips for getting the most out of a tutor session,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Adam Britten', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","As a tutor for many undergraduate classes, I have seen my fair share of interesting students. Most of the time, I feel like students do not know what to expect from a tutoring session. If you know what you are getting yourself into, you will get more out of your time with a tutor. Here are 10 tips that can prepare you for your appointment:

10. Meet wherever you are comfortable.

Whether you like to study in the library, at Starbucks or on the quad, ask your tutor for your appointment to be held there. You will accomplish more if you feel relaxed in your surroundings.

9. Bring your notes and necessary tools.

If you are planning to review concepts, I need to see what you have been learning. Bring all textbooks, class notes, and things like your laptop or calculator if they are needed to get the work done. One of my students showed up to an appointment empty handed and still expected me to be able to help him; he was out of luck.

8. Never give up!

A lot of people approach a tutor already feeling defeated. A positive attitude is the most important thing if you want to raise your grade. Even if you are failing a class, put your best effort into trying. Youll be surprised how well you can do!

7. Be on time.

This is not lecture; you cannot slip in unnoticed. I generally have back-to-back appointments, so I cannot stay late, just like most tutors. You will learn more if you are there your full allotted time.

6. Keep studying afterwards.

Continue working on your homework, going over your notes and reading your textbook. Dont wait until your next appointment to review your notes. Make sure you are fully confident with the work on your own.

5. Dont expect a miracle.

If your exam is tomorrow and this is your first appointment, you are probably seeking a quick fix; it doesnt work that way. Tutoring works best when you have developed a relationship with the tutor. Once you start to feel uneasy about an upcoming exam, schedule an appointment. By the time the exam rolls along, you will be comfortable with your tutor and ready to tackle any exam.

4. Feel comfortable reaching out.

If you have questions, email them to your tutor before the appointment. This will allow them to prepare and give you the best help they can offer. And it is more than all right to email or text a follow-up question after the session. The students who have my number programmed into their phone and feel comfortable texting or calling me are the ones who learn the most.

3. Go to class.

If you are still skipping class at the point of getting a tutor, you need to reorganize your thoughts. One time I found out that one of my students was skipping class. When I asked him about it, he said Well yeah, but thats why I come to you! A tutor is not a replacement for a professor.

2. I cannot do your homework for you.

A few of my students feel like this should be an all-inclusive service. I guess I missed that part of tutor training.

1. Lead the session; you are in charge!

If you are only seeking help with one concept, make your needs direct. Many of my students tell me they are confused about everything when they really just have a few questions. If you do not need a full review, dont let me waste your time with one.",[]

He must return to Texas to post bond, but there isnt a timetable for that yet. The Vikings have deactivated him for Week 2 .

Fantasy football takeaway

Its too soon to judge anything regarding Petersons status beyond this weekend against the New England Patriots.

The Vikings will go with a mix of Matt Asiata (between the tackles, goal line) and Jerick McKinnon (the better pass catcher), and perhaps a practice-squad call-up. They might also call more designed runs for Cordarrelle Patterson.

Asiata would probably be the feature back for as long as Peterson would be unavailable, so hes the preferred pickup. In two games last season in which Peterson didnt play because of injury, Asiata rushed for 51 yards and three touchdowns against Philadelphia in Week 15 and 115 yards vs. Detroit in the season finale.

McKinnon could have use in point-per-reception games.

What this means for daily fantasy

In FantasyScore, Asiata and McKinnon both cost the running back minimum of $3,700 (7.4% of your cap) but are not attractive selections. Asiata is worth playing as a flex because of the price-to-upside ratio.

Patterson ($6,000; 12.0%) looks more likely to meet his lofty price, but hed probably be the focus of Bill Belichicks defense, so it seems like a wash.",[]

Mitt Romney on March 3, 2016, Salt Lake City. (Photo: Ed Kosmicki, AFP/Getty Images)

Donald Trump's strong showing on Super Tuesday put prominent Republicans in a tight spot. They have three distinct choices: Jump on the Trump bandwagon. Stay silent, and try to save their own skins if they end up on the November ballot beneath Trump. Or denounce Trump as unfit for the GOP nomination or the presidency.

Only a few prominent Republicans have had the courage to take that third path, and on Thursday they were joined by Mitt Romney, the GOP's candidate in 2012. Yes, Romney was a little late to the anti-Trump party, but late is better than never. In an extraordinary and eloquent speech, he eviscerated Trump as dangerous to America's economy, values and safety. Calling Trump ""a phony"" and ""a fraud,"" Romney said the billionaire businessman is unsuited by temperament, character and judgment to occupy the Oval Office and represent America on the world stage.

Shortly before Romney spoke, dozens of Republican national security experts, including former Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff, added their voices to the emerging anti-Trump drive by the GOP establishment. In these dangerous times, their message about Trump was both simple and serious: ""He would use the authority of his office to act in ways that would make America less safe.""

Romney and the national security experts followed a growing number of Republicans  including Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman and former Florida senator Mel Martinez  who have recognized that Trump represents a cancer on the party who has lowered the level of American political discourse.

For the GOP, Trump's rise represents an element of reaping what you sow. The party of Lincoln, the party that provided the votes to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, has long since accommodated loud voices who exploit social issues, stoke fears and provoke confrontation. But no one has gone where Trump has ventured.

The litany of his belligerence, bullying and bigotry is as familiar as it is appalling, and practically every day brings a new outrage. Early in the campaign, he denigrated Mexican immigrants and Arizona Sen. John McCain, one of the nation's iconic war heroes and the party's standard-bearer in 2008. (Never mind that Trump himself avoided Vietnam War services thanks to college and medical deferments.)

More recently, he talked about loosening libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, and on Sunday, two days before several primaries in the Deep South, he waffled over denouncing David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who had endorsed Trump. At least that hesitancy drew rebukes from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. But even they chose not to mention Trump by name.

Winners, of course, are easy to support, and several big-name Republicans have lined up in Trump's camp, most prominently his former primary rival, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, along with Maine Gov. Paul LePage, former Arizona governor Jan Brewer and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.

Taking on a bully is much more unpleasant business, as Trump's rivals have discovered. After Romney's speech, Trump fired back with his usual fusillade of schoolyard insults, calling Romney a stiff, a choke artist, a lightweight, and a disaster as a candidate who ran a horrible campaign and begged for his endorsement in 2012. And in what Trump must consider the ultimate put-down, he proclaimed that he has made ""so much more money than Mitt.""

Whether Romney's skewering of Trump will make any difference at the polls is debatable. Heading into the next round of primaries, Trump remains the indisputable front-runner for the nomination, and his anti-establishment supporters have been impervious to previous assaults on his character and record.

But Americans can hope Romney's speech has the same effect as the confrontation that Army counsel Joseph Welch had in 1954 with Sen. Joseph McCarthy, another demagogue who took America down a dangerous and ugly road before a demand for decency stopped him.

The most wonderful time of the year has arrived for college basketball fans.

With the 2016 NCAA men's Division 1 basketball tournament set to tip off in full swing next week, hoops lovers will want to make sure they have a strategy for binge-watching all of the games.

Cord cutters  and cord shavers  will want to note a major change this year that the April 4 championship game will be televised on TBS for the first time. The Final Four, the tournament's semifinals played April 2, will also be broadcast on pay-TV channels TBS, TNT and TruTV. All 67 games over the three-week tournament will be televised across those channels and CBS.

If you don't have pay TV, you will need to secure a seat at your favorite sports bar or deploy an antenna to see all of the CBS-broadcast games on your TV. Games broadcast on CBS will also be available free via the March Madness Live app, but to watch other games on the app you will need to input pay-TV credentials.

Sling TV can provide another vital piece of the viewing puzzle. The Dish Network-provided Net TV service (starting at $20 monthly) includes TBS and TNT in its basic offering, and during the tournament viewers get free access to TruTV (usually it's part of the $5 monthly Lifestyle Extra package).

RCA is teaming with Sling TV for a deal that gives you 10 days of free Sling TV service  enough to cover most of the first two weekends of tournament action  when you buy a new antenna. (For more details, go to RCAAntennas.net; for TruTV, you would need the $5 additional programming package.)

Another option for those in select major metro areas: PlayStation Vue. Sony's service, which is available in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, L.A., New York, Miami, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay area, has CBS, TBS, TNT and TruTV in its $39.99 monthly package. The service recently added ABC and ESPN channels, in addition to lowering its monthly price.

Even though no championship game has surpassed the viewership of the 1979 final that pitted the Magic Johnson-led Michigan State Spartans against Larry Bird's Indiana State Sycamores, the earlier tournament rounds continue to draw a bigger audience. Last year's coverage averaged 11.3 million total viewers, up 8% from 2014, according to the NCAA, and achieved the highest average viewership for the tournament in 22 years (vs. 12.7 million in 1993).

A screen shot of the March Madness Live app (Photo: March Madness Live)

And online viewing is on the rise. The NCAA March Madness Live app on devices and desktops set new records last year, with 80.7 million live video streams and 17.8 million hours of live video consumption, increases of 17% and 19%, respectively. Online viewership of the 2015 championship game in which Duke beat Wisconsin set new highs, with 3.4 million live video streams and 1 million hours of live video consumption.

""That number has gone up every year, and I expect it to increase again in 2016,"" said Chris Brantner, who oversees the CutCableToday website and has a March Madness guide for cord cutters there.

He notes that Sling TV, which launched in February 2015, couldn't handle all the traffic during last year's Final Four game between Kentucky and Wisconsin. ""Theyve made drastic improvements to their service so they can better handle the load of huge events like March Madness,"" Brantner said. ""This will likely be their biggest test to date.""

Sling TV's Danielle Johnson concurred in an email interview. ""We now regularly stream live events like the college football championships at dramatically greater scale than we had when we experienced some of the technical glitches we saw earlier in our launch,"" she said. ""Streaming live TV at scale presents significantly more challenges than streaming on-demand content. No streaming service can be perfect all of the time, but we have made great strides in improving our service and this is something we will continue to be focused on for years to come.""

Let the games begin.

In short: If a player accrues more than 172 days worth of big-league service in his rookie season, he will be eligible for free agency after his first six seasons. Preventing that  keeping a player in the minors for only a couple of weeks to ensure he spends less than the 172 days in the show  allows teams a full extra year of that players cost-controlled services before he can leave to the highest bidder. And young players who open the season on a teams 40-man roster must spend at least 20 days in the minors on optional assignments to delay free agency. Plus, cost-conscious teams may understandably keep a player in Triple-A until the middle of the season to prevent him from establishing Super Two status, which allows him to file for salary arbitration earlier than otherwise.

Good, thorough explanations of baseballs service-time clocks and Super Two rules can be found at MLB Trade Rumors and DRaysBay.com. What follows here is an incomplete list of exciting young players that are now or soon will be available to impact Major League clubs and remain under those teams control through the 2019 season, in no particular order.

Wil Myers, Tampa Bay Rays

The reigning Minor League Player of the Year and jewel of the trade that sent James Shields to Kansas City, Myers is a powerful 22-year-old outfielder who could aid the Rays anemic offense in the clubs pursuit of the AL East pennant. Hes off to a solid if unspectacular start in Triple-A Durham, batting .304 with an .834 OPS.

In his way: The Rays are known as one of baseballs most creative teams, and theyve got flexibility in the form of versatile veteran Ben Zobrist. Zobrist has mostly played right field the past two seasons, but has spent time at every position besides catcher and pitcher in his career. Zobrists presence means Myers, who has played 14 games in right field in Triple-A in 2013, could replace virtually any struggling player in the clubs lineup. The Rays have a few of those.

Trivia: Myers proper first name is William. The World Wide Web offers little in the way of explanation as to why he spells his nickname Wil instead of Will. Seems pretty emo.

Random Internet find: Myers broke a camera with a foul ball in the 2012 Futures Game:

Zack Wheeler, New York Mets

Wheeler ranked No. 11 in Baseball Americas annual list of the Top 100 prospects after a strong 2012 campaign across Double- and Triple-A. Wheeler throws a fastball in the mid-90s with good movement and a strong curveball.

In his way: Right now, Wheelers control is likely the biggest obstacle preventing him from the Majors. He has allowed 28 free passes in only 51 1/3 Triple-A innings across 2012 and 2013. Mets manager Terry Collins recently told reporters that high-walk outings from Wheeler in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League are a red flag. With Johan Santana likely out for the season after a second shoulder surgery, the Mets have used righty Jeremy Hefner and lefty Aaron Laffey in the back of their rotation. Both pitchers have ERAs over 7.00.

Trivia: The Mets got Wheeler in a July, 2011 trade that sent Carlos Beltran to the San Francisco Giants. Beltrans contract came with the clause that he could not be offered arbitration after its final year, meaning the acquiring Giants did not receive draft-pick compensation when Beltran signed with the Cardinals in the offseason  foreshadowing a new feature of the leagues latest collective bargaining agreement.

Random Internet find: Wheeler does not lack for control with his pumpkin-carving knife:

Billy Hamilton, Cincinnati Reds

With unprecedented speed on the basepaths, Hamilton became something of a folk hero in 2012 by stealing 155 bases across Single- and Double-A and setting a new record for stolen bases in a season. A shortstop until this winter, Hamiltons still new to center field, but his quickness allows him to make up for bad reads.

In his way: The Reds have Shin-Soo Choo playing center field everyday and Choos off to an incredible start at the plate. But Choos defense in center is a concern, and starting left fielder Ryan Ludwick is on the 60-day disabled list following an opening day shoulder injury. Still, Hamilton will need to prove he can get on base regularly to make his electrifying speed an asset, and hes off to a slow start in Triple-A Louisville.

Trivia: Baseballs O.G. Billy Hamilton, a Hall of Fame outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Beaneaters around the turn of the 20th century, held the record for career stolen bases from 1897 to 1978. He was known as Sliding Billy.

Random Internet find: Watch Hamilton run. Via GIFULMINATION.com:

Bruce Rondon, Detroit Tigers

Considered an early favorite to win the Tigers closer job out of spring training despite only eight innings worth of experience above Double-A entering the 2013 season, Rondon is armed with triple-digit fastball and a developing secondary arsenal. When Rondon was sent to Triple-A in late March, Tigers manager Jim Leyland insisted the 22-year-old righty did nothing wrong.

In his way: The Tigers bullpen has a 4.53 ERA in the early season and no reliever has notched more than one save. The club has veteran closer Jose Valverde working to build up strength in Single-A Lakeland, but no one pitcher should stand in Rondons way whenever the Tigers feel hes ready.

Trivia: The Venezuelan-born Rondon is named for martial-arts legend Bruce Lee.

Random Internet find: For some reason, Rondon once hosted a contest to give away tickets to Movie 43, a film Roger Ebert called the Citizen Kane of awful.

Thanks to the gang @RelativityMedia, I'm giving away a pair of tickets to see #Movie43! RT for a chance to win! @tigers pic.twitter.com/UyfiMTTH  Bruce Rondon (@BruceRondon) January 16, 2013

Nolan Arenado, Colorado Rockies

Arenado surged onto the prospect radar with a strong 2011 season as a 20-year-old in Single-A Modesto, but scuffled a bit in Double-A in 2012. He showed up at Rockies camp in 2013 focused and nearly wrested the starting third-base job from Chris Nelson.

In his way: Nelson, a converted middle infielder who enjoyed a breakout season in 2012 but is off to a slow start in 2013.

Trivia: Arenado was a high-school teammate of Yankees catching prospect Austin Romine at the awesomely named El Toro High School in California.

Random Internet find: Arenado weighed 234 pounds at the end of his first professional season, but has lost about 30 pounds and kept it off.

Mike Zunino, Seattle Mariners

College baseballs Golden Spikes Award winner in 2012 and the third-overall selection in last years draft, Zunino posted a 1.137 OPS in 44 games across Single- and Double-A last season and has picked up where he left off in Triple-A in 2013, stroking five homers in his first 13 games.

In his way: The Mariners have primarily been using Jesus Montero behind the plate, but most feel Montero would be best served as a designated hitter or first baseman. The clubs first baseman, Justin Smoak, has yet to live up to his mega-prospect hype and is now 26.

Trivia: Zunino is the son of Greg Zunino, a longtime Major League scout.

Random web find: Zunino was too young to attend the Marlins World Series games in 1997.

Honorable mentions: The Dodgers outfield is crowded with six- and seven-figure contracts, but there remains some chance spring training sensation and Cuban import Yasiel Puig is too good to be held in the minors for long.

Rays Triple-A shortstop Hak-Ju Lee was destined for this list before he tore ligaments in his left knee. Heres to a speedy recovery for Lee, who can use this time to up his already fantastic singing-the-Carpenters-in-an-awesome-T-shirt-game:",[]

To set the scene: Fulham played the first leg of the series at Juventus and got blown out, losing 3-1 at the Stadio Olimpico di Turin. They needed a miracle back at home, and somehow it looked like it was possible. After Juventus scored, their star Fabio Cannavaro was sent off, and Fulham scored three goals to tie the game on aggregate. Craven Cottage was starting to believe.

Then Dempsey did something Ive never seen before.

After a run-up of play, he dribbled the ball to the edge of the 18-yard box, moving away from the keeper, and launched a chip. It was perfectly weighted, over the head of the keeper, into the top corner, giving Fulham the win. It was so good not only because it was perfectly executed but because Ive never seen anything like it before  it was beyond audacious. It was inspired.

It was voted the greatest goal in Fulhams history, and Ill never forget where I was when I watched it  its one of a handful of goals Ive seen in my life that caused me to scream, and the only goal Ive ever seen in my life that caused me to run a full lap around my house.",[]

A settlement in the case of a former Pop Warner football player who committed suicide at 25 and had CTE is apparently a first of its kind and raises questions about the future of youth football.

The wrongful death suit was filed in federal court in Wisconsin in 2015 seeking $5 million in damages. It was settled last month for an undisclosed sum.

This could potentially open the floodgates for more suits involving head injuries and youth sports, attorney Marc Lamber told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday. You can see the direction this is headed.

Lamber, who is not involved in the case, focuses his practice on catastrophic injury and wrongful death litigation as director of Fennemore Craig in Phoenix. He says increases in insurance premiums could potentially upset the economic model of youth sports.

Joseph Chernach hanged himself in 2012. His family sent tissue samples from his brain to Boston University where severe signs of CTE were found. The degenerative brain disease is often the result of repetitive brain trauma. The suit alleged that Pop Warner failed to train coaches properly or limit hitting in practice and that such conduct disregarded Chernachs right to safety and health.

Chernach played Pop Warner football for four years, beginning at age 11, in Wisconsin and Michigan, playing running back and linebacker. He also played high school football and was a wrestler and pole vaulter. Debra Pyka, his mother, told ABC News last year that her sons demeanor changed in college: I just couldnt understand why a happy kid turned into someone so depressed.

Pop Warner spokesman Brian Heffron said a confidentiality agreement as part of the settlement prevents him from speaking about the case beyond a prepared statement that he sent by email. He stressed Pop Warner has instituted a series of safety and educational initiatives in recent years.

At Pop Warner there is nothing more important than the safety of our players and since 2010 we have led the way in making the game of youth football a safer and better experience than ever before, the statement says. We have established protocols and rule changes aimed at improving coaching education, limiting contact and requiring any player who suffers a potential head injury to be examined by a medical professional trained in concussions before returning to play.

The suit alleged that Pop Warner football is abnormally dangerous ... as it exposes children to a combative/collision sport which is likely to result in harm. Plaintiffs attorney Gordon Johnson Jr. of the Brain Injury Law Group in Wisconsin did not immediately return a call for comment on the case.

Lamber says this is the first case involving head injury settled by Pop Warner. He calls that significant because it weakens the argument that CTE is more likely to happen in the NFL where players are bigger and stronger. He says some studies suggest head injuries can be more dangerous for younger brains than for mature ones.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 21:33:50+00:00,The Denver Broncos need to go all in for Colin Kaepernick,"[""Luke Kerr-dineen Is A Writer Editor At Ftw Anglo-american Who Likes All Sports But Especially Golf Soccer He Saw The Spice Girls In Concert Once It's Been Downhill Ever Since"", 'Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Andrew Joseph']","The Denver Broncos had it all planned out so perfectly. Its 2012; They land Peyton Manning and then draft Brock Osweiler. Peyton was going to deliver one more Super Bowl, and Osweiler was going to lead them into the future.

The chips were falling into place beautifully, too. Just as Mannings powers were waning Osweiler was starting to ascend. Manning wins his Super Bowl, retires, and all thats left is to re-sign Osweiler. Oh how wonderful it is when things like this fall into place.

And then Osweiler signed for the Houston Texans. Early reports peg the contract at four years and $72 million.

Suddenly, the defending Super Bowl champs are left in the uneviable position of looking for a good quarterback in a market saturated with resoundingly mediocre options. I mean, come on: Brock Osweiler and Sam Bradford are decent, but to command that kind of money? Give me a break.

So what are their options?

Coaxing Peyton out of retirement is juicy idea until you remember that hes simply not an NFL-caliber quarterback anymore, and so we move to the free market.

Johnny Manziel is a non-starter for obvious reasons. Case Keenum is a pretty underwhelming option, as is the idea of trading for Nick Foles. Robert Griffin III could have a huge upside but its a gamble that, quite frankly, seems a little unbecoming for the reigning Super Bowl champs. And besides, he seems destined to end up in Los Angeles at this point. How about Ryan Fitzpatrick? Hes probably the best of all these options, but hes still a pretty feverish wild card that looks ready to self combust at any moment.

And then theres Colin Kaepernick, who seems to make all the sense in the world for the Broncos at this point.

Yes, hes had a shaky last couple of seasons, but hes the only one of these players that has proved he can play among the very best in the right system. He wants out of San Francisco, too, so a fresh start might provide just the jolt he needs.

The thing is with the Broncos is that the framework is still there. They didnt win the Super Bowl because of its quarterback, they won it in spite of him. Anything better than that and they could have a serious shot again next year. Kaepernick is the only quarterback who can fulfill that requirement, and with options quickly vanishing from the table, the sooner they make a move, the better.",[]

Internships. It is seemingly impossible to get a job without one (or a few) under your belt, but the application process suddenly appears daunting when most internship postings dictate for so-and-so majors only. What is a freshman/sophomore/person who hasnt known what passion they wanted to pursue since they were 8 to do? Give up on the internship search? Never! Lie on their resume? Negative. Fortunately, an emphasis on networking, specific talents and professionalism can help those students land an internship.

Step 1: Follow your skills and interests.

Even if you dont have a major, we all have our talents in certain subject areas. Why not search for postings, either fliers or online, for internships available in those departments at your university? The second internship I was ever offered stemmed from my walking through the English department, seeing a flyer for a PR/advertising internship, and thought, That seems interesting, why not apply? Additionally, some colleges even have internship classes open to all students in which professors use their resources to help students obtain internships for academic credit.

Step 2: Utilize your networks.

Luckily for those of us in the Millennial generation, we have a variety of networks at our disposal that goes beyond simply reaching out to family and friends. Twitter, for example, is amazing  sending a simple tweet of I would love to become involved with (@insert company here), how would I go about doing that? can open doors. Also, a more direct way to get your foot in the door of said company is by searching the contact information of either the internship coordinator or someone that has the job you want, and emailing them your resume and a brief summary of who you are, where youre from and what youre looking for. It might be a little intimidating throwing yourself out there, but it is that exact confidence to take initiative that stands out to potential employers.

Step 3: Have an awesome interview.

Even if you dont have the major a company is looking for, or dont think you have enough experience for a job, all you need is to have an awesome interview to be seriously considered. Prepare yourself by having your resume and cover letter on hand for quick reference, re-read the job description youre applying for, look professional and, most importantly, be confident. If you are confident that you are the right person for the internship position and portray it to the employer, it will definitely make a lasting positive impression.

Following these steps, I have had an internship as a freshman, been the youngest student to be offered another internship in my previous universitys news office, scored an on-campus job via Skype interview before even arriving on campus as a transfer and have had opportunities to write for multiple companies just by reaching out to them on Twitter and email. I accomplished all this without declaring a major, and so can anyone with enough persistence and confidence. Remember, as Ayn Rand said, The question isnt who is going to let me; its who is going to stop me.

usatoday.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,Taste the new wave of craft breweries in Paris,['Mary Winston Nicklin Special For Usa Today'],"Paris may conjure images of Bacchus-style feasting, but in the last few years, this wine-loving capital is experiencing a boom of artisanal craft breweries. The beer-drinking tradition is hardly new to Paris; the Middle Ages saw a large consumption of beer watery swill , and prior to that, mead (brewed without hops). Breweries thrived until the middle of the 20th century, when they shuttered as a result of competition from big multinational beverage corporations.

Enter a new wave of young brewers, who aim to put the French capital on the worlds craft beer map. These passionate entrepreneurs are proving to be real taste-makers as Parisians get thirsty for diverse, hoppy styles of beer with unique character. To complement their efforts, a new crop of watering holes (like La Fine Mousse) and specialty beer boutiques (like Bierocratie) are proving to be a sudsy success. Some of these French brews are even making the leap across the pond; La Parisienne just started exporting to the USA. (Just look for the label with the sexy Parisienne riding a bike in front of the Eiffel Tower!)

Many of these brewers were inspired by international experiences. The co-founders of BAPBAP, Edouard Minart and Archibald Tropres, credit their beer enlightenment to visiting the Brooklyn Brewery for the former, and discovering Germanys Hefeweizen for the latter.

Likewise, Jean Barthelemy Chancel developed a passion for craft beer while traveling abroad, which led him to found the organic Brasserie Artisanale du Luberon in Provence in 2011, followed by La Parisienne in 2014. (The youngest Champagne negociant manipulant, Chancel is also the owner of Champagne Louis Barthelemy.

Indeed, the American craft beer revolution has had an undeniable influence on the Paris beer scene. Word on the street is that Brooklyn Brewery is even looking to open a space in Paris. Compared to other major capitals like London, where there are 66 craft breweries, Berlin or New York (home to about 30 breweries each), there is so much more to be done in Paris, says Minart.

Today there are officially five craft breweries in the French capital: Brasserie de la Goutte dOr, La Baleine, Brasserie de lEtre, BAPBAP and La Parisienne, with myriad micro-brasseries also established in the surrounding Ile-de-France region. (Note that two brewpubs, FrogPubs and ONeil, started brewing English-style beers decades before the current craft beer craze.) What this means for beer-loving visitors to Paris: Its possible to chart a veritable Tour de Paris, stopping for tours and tastings across town.

Travelers can sample the scene by following the trail pictured in the gallery above.",[]

3B/OF Yasmany Tomas, Arizona Diamondbacks

Last years hype has dissipated. Now he actually has a full-time role while still boasting game-changing pop.

SP Anthony DeSclafani, Cincinnati Reds

His 4.52 second-half ERA hid 8.28 K/9, 1.51 BB/9, and a spicy new curveball that could make him a secret ace.

FANTASY DRAFT GUIDE: Award-winning advice

OF Domingo Santana and Rymer Liriano, Milwaukee Brewers

The Khris Davis trade makes Santana ... the new Davis: low average, big-time pop. Liriano could be a sneaky double-digit contributor in homers and steals if he can win the center field job.

OF Avisail Garcia, Chicago White Sox

Has always had power, work on swing mechanics could pay off. Remember when everyone called him a breakout candidate?

SP Matt Moore, Tampa Bay Rays

Hes almost two years removed from his Tommy John surgery, and his strong finish to 2015 restores his elite strikeout ceiling.

OF Rusney Castillo, Boston Red Sox

The attention from last year has died down, and you could score a 15-20 player for peanuts.

SP Eduardo Rodriguez, Boston Red Sox

If he gains more efficiency around the plate (and gets over his recent knee woes), his big fastball will give him even more power.

C Blake Swihart, Boston Red Sox

He might give discount Realmuto numbers.

1B C.J. Cron, Los Angeles Angels

Already the likely DH, the 20-homer stick could wind up in a prominent run-production role if Albert Pujols (foot) has to miss a significant number of games.

SP Rich Hill, Oakland Athletics

His new curveball also might lead to a breakout, and could extend his career. Pitching in Oakland ... not a bad spot.

SP Nate Karns, Seattle Mariners

Hell have to hold off James Paxton, but Karns stats have been better (8.88 K/9, 3.43 BB/9 last year).

OF Dalton Pompey, Toronto Blue Jays

Cant trust Michael Saunders to stay healthy. Pompey could be one of the biggest surprises in the stolen base column for this elite lineup.

SP Tyler Duffey, Minnesota Twins

The big-framed righty isnt the great strikeout arm he convinced us he was last year, but theres plenty to like for the potential innings-eater.

ROOKIES PREVIEW: Top 15 for 2016

SP Jonathan Gray, Colorado Rockies

Pitching in Coors Field stinks, but Gray doesnt, despite that 5.53 ERA. He punched out 40 in 40 2/3 innings last year and looks poised to do more with the stuff that made him the third overall pick of the 2013 draft.

SP Brandon Finnegan, Cincinnati Reds

If he fights his way into the rotation, his grounder-K makeup could serve him and opportunistic fantasy players well.",[]

The next generation of Samsung Galaxy smartphones is upon us, and whether you're anxiously waiting for the postman to deliver an S7 Edge or you're tearing into the packaging while reading this, one thing is certain: No one wants to be the person who breaks their new flagship smartphone on account of carrying it around without a case. Related Report: Samsung Galaxy S7 Has the Most Accurate Display Ever Thankfully, we've already done most of the heavy-lifting for you and compiled a handful of cases, most of which can be purchased right now. Remember, kidsa smartphone is only useful if its screen isn't spiderwebbed. Don't let your new investment fall victim to your butterfingers.

Spigen Not just a really fun word to say, Spigen is a well-respected smartphone accessory manufacturer thats been stepping up the case game for a while now. This two-piece, bumper style case has a single objectiveto outfit your S7 with military-grade protection without bulking up your smartphone. The TPU designation refers to thermoplastic polyurethane; a soft, rubbery plastic that provides a solid grip while still allowing the phone to be taken out of a pocket without much resistance. Consider this case if you want a reasonable level of protection without turning your smartphone into a hefty, chunky slab.

In the words of Hannibal Buress, ""Phone, keys, wallet. PKW."" Always check for all three before you leave someplace. Spigen's synthetic leather wallet case is for those of us who still struggle to remember the PKW mantra, since it puts your smartphone, cards, and money into one place. The wallet case has three card slots, a pocket for cash, and a magnetic clip to keep everything in one place. It's also currently under $20, which is a pretty good price given the case's functionality.

Obliq

Sometimes, all you need is utility. If minimalism is what you're looking for, check out this basic, clear plastic case by Obliq. Around the perimeter of the case you'll find a TPU bumper that protects your precious S7 from drops. There's also a magnetic kickstand that props your phone up for on-the-go video watching. Is it the fanciest option? Heck no. But it does what it needs to do without covering up the S7's elegant design flourishes.

OtterBox

Maybe minimalism isn't your thing. Maybe you're the bold, fashionable type; someone who sees your phone as an extension of your outfit. The Symmetry Series from OtterBox protects your S7 from minor hazards but does so in stylewith bright color combinations and patterns. These cases won't give you nearly as much protection as something like the Spigen bumper style case, but it should protect your Galaxy S7 from minor falls. And, if you do happen to drop your new phone, at least it'll look good on the way down.

Lifeproof Credit: Lifeproof This case is waterproof, dustproof, and snowproof. Surely you've heard about the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge's IP68 rating, which is a complicated, nerdy way of saying ""waterproof and dustproof."" The Samsung flagships are so waterproof, in fact, that they can be fully submerged up to 30 minutes. Pretty cool!

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Giants get Vernon, Jenkins, Harrison in free agency","['Est March', 'P M']","(Photo: The Associated Press)

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP)  Moments after former Miami pass rusher Olivier Vernon agreed to terms on a five-year, $85 million contract Wednesday, Giants general manager Jerry Reese might have echoed the defensive end's agent David Canter when he tweeted ""What a day.""

Given one last opportunity by Giants co-owner John Mara to bulk up a roster that had not made the playoffs in four years, Reese made a huge splash on the first day of NFL free agency. New York agreed to terms with Vernon, former Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins, and former Jets defensive tackle Damon ""Snacks"" Harrison.

Combined with their own defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul signing his one-year, $10.5 million contract shortly after Wednesday's 4 p.m. start time, Reese will have addressed immediately major weaknesses in the defensive front and the secondary.

All are expected to sign five-year deals as early as Thursday, shortly after they arrive at the Giants' training center for physicals.

Vernon, the 6-foot-2, 261-pound centerpiece of Reese's $200 million spending spree was regarded as the premier pass-rusher in this year's free agent class. The 25-year-old had 712 sacks in 16 starts in 2015 while being a constant presence in the backfield. He is expected to pair with Pierre-Paul to rejuvenate the NFL's weakest pass rush.

The Giants confirmed Pierre-Paul's signing Wednesday.

""I have one year to prove myself, but all I need is one,"" Pierre-Paul said in a statement. ""I know for a fact that I can play better than I did last year.""

Harrison, 27, will be play next to returning veteran Jonathan Hankins to form a solid middle. Though he had only a half-sack in 16 starts last year, Harrison is a noted run-stopper who was in on 72 tackles in 2015.

Harrison is expected to sign a five-year, $46.25 million contract, with $24 million guaranteed.

The Jenkins signing will likely end Prince Amukamara's Giants career. The 2011 first-round draft pick was told by the Giants to test the open market, where he expects to land a contract in the $10 million per year neighborhood despite an injury history that caused him to miss 25 out of 80-games in his career.

Jenkins will get slightly more than $12 million annually, making him the second-highest-paid cornerback behind the Jets' Darrelle Revis' $14.024 million average.

In Jenkins, the Giants will gain a durable, productive cornerback to pair with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to provide immediate improvement to the league's worst pass defense. The cornerback finished last season with three interceptions, has 10 picks and 35 breakups since 2012, one of only five cornerbacks to achieve those levels. He has six touchdowns in his career.

Harrison came the longest way to get to his big payday. The Jets signed him as an undrafted free agent out of NAIA-level William Penn in Iowa.

He played in only five games as a rookie, but the 6-foot-4, 350-pound nose tackle moved into a starting spot the next season. He started every game there the last three seasons, compiling 193 total tackles, 11 12 sacks, two pass breakups, and a forced fumble.

The three contracts will cost the Giants about $114 million in guaranteed salary.

Two Chinese maintenance workers face charges in the death of a woman trapped in an elevator for a month, authorities in western China said.

Government officials in China's Gaoling district told the Beijing Times the woman might have starved to death.

The elevator apparently became stuck between the 10th and 11th floors of a building in the city of Xian on Jan. 30, the Times said. Service men called to deal with the broken cable banged on the door, but when they heard no response they cut off power to the elevator and told residents to use a different lift, the officials said.

When the servicemen returned to fix the cable last week, they opened the elevator door and found the woman's body.

Her hands were distorted... there were scratches on the wall, it was horrible, a building resident told the Times.

Residents said they had heard no strange sounds coming from the elevator while it was inoperative. The government said the servicemen should have opened the door to make certain no one was inside.

The victim, 43, lived by herself in the building. Authorities ruled out foul play, but the Associated Press said authorities determined the cause required charges of involuntary manslaughter because the death was caused by gross negligence.

(Photo: thaifreedomhouse.org)

Instead of drinking beer and working on their tan, students can spend their spring break helping others. A few international programs offer students a chance to help migrants, while others will put them to work aiding villages, troubled kids and environmental efforts. You can do a lot of finite work in a short amount of time, says Megan Lee, director of Goabroad.com, a site for international learning and volunteer opportunities. And students benefit too. They come back from these with a renewed sense of self, and more clarity about their future. Some programs are as short as one week, while others require a minimum of two or more, and all charge fees to support their work. She shares some favorites with Larry Bleiberg for USA TODAY.

Work with refugee relief in Greece

Servant Group International offers short-term programs in March and April, working with Muslim refugees predominantly from North Africa and the Middle East, Lee says. Theyre doing a great job giving refugees food and clothing. Youd be seeing the human side of the crisis and would have a richer perspective than anyone who just reads headlines. 615-832-2282; servantgroup.org

Assist asylum seekers in Belgium

If you speak French, you can help out refugees from areas like Syria, Iraq, Iran and Congo. A program, based at a government-run refugee center in the town of Rixensart, works with groups of children and adults on recreational activities. Theyre incredibly vulnerable, confused and maybe in shock. The volunteers are part of the effort to welcome them into society, Lee says. 802-540-3060; vfp.org

Teach English to Burmese migrants

This program in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand works with refugees escaping human rights violations in Burma. They are fleeing years of oppression and trying to start new lives for themselves, Lee says. Run by the Thai Freedom House, short-term volunteer programs are available. thaifreedomhouse.org

Help with health care in Guatemala

Special one-week spring break opportunities in this poor Central American country give students an opportunity to assist doctors and nurses, or help out at schools or senior centers. Other short-term programs are available in Costa Rica and India. They have a ton of destinations and a ton of opportunities, Lee says. 800-380-4777; crossculturalsolutions.org

Teach surfing in South Africa

While showing someone how to ride waves might not sound important, the Cape Town program makes a difference, teaching children how to swim, and keeping them off the streets and out of trouble, Lee says. It helps them develop an appreciation for natural resources in their country. Programs begin at two weeks. 646-240-4545; goeco.org

Support a sustainable community in Ecuador

A spring break-specific program has students helping out in a 50-family village, which has prospered thanks to organic gardening, a small-scale dairy, conservation and eco-tourism.

Demonstrators outside of the Supreme Court on March 2, 2016. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)

The Supreme Court is considering whether a Texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion clinics and requires abortionists to have hospital admitting privileges is constitutional, according to their interpretation of that document in light of the court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which ushered in nationwide abortion on demand.

As the number of abortions have declined significantly since their high point of more than 1.5 million per year  now approaching 60 million total since Roe  pro-lifers have been gaining moral and legal ground, especially with younger people. The pro-choice side has decided to fight back with testimonies from women who have had abortions and not only do not regret them, but are happy and fulfilled because they ended the life of their baby.

Last month, The Washington Post carried a front-page story about historian Melissa Madera, who runs a podcast called The Abortion Diary, where women anonymously tell personal stories about their abortions.

Separately in the pages of Cosmopolitan magazine, television actress Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy) wrote that she ""never, not for one moment, regretted aborting her baby. Heres an excerpt: In the spring of my junior year at Harvard, my period was late. I had been in a relationship for almost two years with a loving and supportive boyfriend. We used birth control, but it malfunctioned. When I learned I was pregnant, I knew immediately and without question that I wanted an abortion. I had no desire to be a mother at that time  I wanted to finish college and start my career.

Note the number of times she says I. Brenneman could have given birth, allowed a childless family to adopt the baby, still finished college and started her career. Pregnancy lasts only nine months. Death is forever.

In more than 30 years of speaking at fundraisers for pregnancy help centers, I, too, have heard the stories of women with unplanned pregnancies. Virtually every one who decided to see her pregnancy through and either parent, or place the baby up for adoption, has never regretted it. Women I have met who had an abortion have told me of their deep remorse and being ignorant of alternatives. Some turned to drugs and alcohol or became promiscuous. Many are scarred emotionally, biologically and spiritually.

Robbing so many babies of their ""unalienable"" right to live has had a corrosive effect on our culture and led to the devaluing of other categories of life. These include street shootings, assisted suicide laws and, soon to come, rationed health care to rid us of the burdensome elderly and seriously ill. If some lives dont matter, then ultimately all lives might be at risk.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Women who abort for convenience or out of fear their babies might be a burden in achieving their goals have missed an opportunity to see what can happen if they dont personally replace God in matters of life and death. I know. I have met some of those former babies, now grown. They are pleased their mothers, many of whom had not planned to become pregnant, gave them a chance to live and to follow their dreams.

Every argument once made in favor of abortion has been answered, from who will care for the child? to who will help the woman after her child is born? This is what pregnancy help centers do, and they do it without cost, unlike abortion clinics and Planned Parenthood, which profit from womens difficult circumstances, leading to the question, Who really cares more about women?

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Contraction in U.S. shale pushes oil towards $40,"['Oilprice Com', 'Est March', 'Nick Cunningham', 'A M']","Have oil prices finally turned a corner? (Photo: Frederic J. Brown, AFP/Getty Images)

Crude oil prices have rallied by more than 30% since early February and investors are growing more confident that a rebound is in order. Have oil prices finally turned a corner?

The sudden wave of cautious optimism surrounding the direction of oil prices can be boiled down to the decline in U.S. oil production, a trend that is starting to pick up pace. While U.S. oil producers managed to stave off significant production declines in 2015, drillers are finally starting to capitulate with oil prices in the mid-$30s per barrel and below.

The effects are starting to show up in the data. The EIA reported weekly estimatesshowing that U.S. production has now dropped below 9.1 million barrels per day (mb/d). That is a departure from the past few months  the U.S. saw little to no decline in output in the fourth quarter, as weekly figures pointed to a resilient rate of production that hovered between 9.1 and 9.2 mb/d. That trend continued into the early part of 2016 even though prices crashed below $30 per barrel.

However, by the end of January, the EIA believes that U.S. oil production finally started to see output fall. Between January and the end of February, the U.S. lost over 150,000 barrels per day in production. The EIAs weekly figures are not as accurate as their retrospective monthly estimates, but since the monthly figures are published with several months of a lag, it could be a few more months before we get a more accurate picture of how fast output is falling.

The rig count also continues to fall, suggesting that production declines are more or less locked in for the next few months at least. The oil rig count dropped below 400 for the week ending on March 4. Drilling activity has ground to a halt, and with capital budgets stretched or broken, the industry wont be able to bring enough new sources of supply online to offset mounting legacy production.

The announcements from U.S. shale companies back up the data emerging from the EIA. In recent weeks more than a dozen U.S. shale companies announced that they expected their production to decline in 2016, a list that continues to grow. For example, Continental Resources, an iconic driller in the Bakken, has pretty much given up on completing wells in North Dakota this year. The companys output could fall by 10% this year as a result. More and more companies are following suit.

Taken together, it appears as if the market is finally starting to balance, even if the process may protracted and painful for E&P companies. Growing optimism about the direction has pushed oil prices up by 30% in less than a month. WTI jumped above $36 per barrel on March 7, the highest price since early January. Brent is closing in on $40 per barrel.

Oil speculators are becoming more bullish on oil prices. Hedge funds are rapidly liquidating their short bets, as fears of sub-$20 oil have all but vanished for now. According to data from the CFTC, net-short positions fell by 15% for the week ending on March 1. ""We might see the real bottom being behind us,"" Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at Citigroup Inc., said on Bloomberg TV on March 4.

In addition, although a lot of questions remain, OPEC representatives are planning on meeting with Russias energy minister between March 20 and April 1 to follow up on their production freeze agreement. An outright cut to production remains a long-shot, especially since Saudi Arabias oil minister Ali al-Naimi all but ruled it out at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston in late February. It is hard to imagine OPEC and Russia shifting course from the production freeze, but any agreement to take additional action represents an upside risk to oil prices.

Given the mounting evidence, it seems that the oil price rally is finally here, then? Maybe. But it is also possible that bullish sentiment is starting to outstrip the fundamentals, even if the fundamentals are trending in the right direction. U.S. production declines are still proceeding modestly, a pace that is not quick enough to soak up the 1.5 mb/d or so of excess supply anytime soon.

Moreover, oil storage levels are still rising in the United States, hitting a new record last week of 518 million barrels. Until inventories are drawn down substantially, oil prices will run into a ceiling every time they try to rally.

The worst of the oil bust may be over, and oil prices dropping to $20 per barrel seems increasingly unlikely. But with prices up more than 30% in just a few weeks and the world still suffering from oversupply, is there really any more room for price gains in the short-term?

And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University?, Romney said. And then theres Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not.

At his press conference Tuesday night, Trump stood next to a table laden with Trump goods including raw steaks, wine and bottled water. After winning two states primaries that night, the businessman launched into a defense of his many eponymous products.

Donald Trump supporters in Phoenix in 2015. (Photo: Ross D. Franklin, AP)

Border security and illegal immigration are a central theme of voter agitation on the side of Republicans and many independents, largely because leaders in government have been all talk and no action for too long.

Voters are now expressing their frustration on these and other issues, and its showcased in the form of the Republican front-runner, Donald Trump.

Theres much appeal around rhetoric that promotes not just the enforcement of Americas borders, but also the enforcement of immigration laws. And while the idea of deporting 11 million people is not within the scope of possibility, its what such a pronouncement signals thats the true magnet.

What voters have been desperate to hear and believe is a commitment from a national leading candidate that every effort will be made to enforce Americas immigration laws evenly and consistently. Further, a majority of Americans despise the idea that sanctuary cities exist, and states so openly defy and circumvent federal immigration laws, yet nothing has been done to stop them.

Voters are also aware that the most effective way to deal with the large population of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is through the jobs they seek. Enforce the law, deny the jobs enticement, and the number of illegal immigrants residing in the country will decline.

The frustration also applies to what happens to violent criminal aliens. States and cities shouldnt decide whether to report arrests or selectively determine which arrests warrant a phone call to the federal government. This played out last summer, when San Francisco released a violent criminal who killed a young woman with a bright future.

So when a candidate like Donald Trump raises the prospect of building a wall on the border, or deporting 11 million people, millions of Americans are not necessarily voting for those things specifically. Rather, theyre voting for a commitment to do what the past two administrations have failed to do. Theyre voting for the idea that finally somebody is willing to enforce the law to the extent that the law requires.

Thats something Americans are right to demand.

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., supports Donald Trump for president.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Western Washington U. students demand new College of Power and Liberation,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","A newly formed group of students at Western Washington University, called the Student Assembly for Power and Liberation, tired of the legacy of colonialism, are demanding upwards of $100,000 in university money to create a College of Power and Liberation.

As explained in a petition posted online Feb. 28, the university would focus on studying the histories of under- and misrepresented communities.

It would meet the growing needs ... for social justice, especially those (movements) that reflect the histories and experiences of marginalized peoples, the petition reads.

The petition comes in the wake of an investigation into how the Bellingham, Wash., schools police department handled a race-based threat against a student last fall. Sophomore Tysen Dane Campbell was charged with malicious harassment after posting Lets lynch her on Yik Yak in reference to the president of the Associated Students of WWU, Belina Seare, according to The Bellingham Herald.

The SAPL demands that the group have direct input and decision-making power over faculty hiring decisions for the college. In terms of a space, the SAPL calls the existing WWU alumni house as an acceptable temporary space until the university administration commits to funding a new building.

The group is also asking that the colleges annual budget include money for a Student Emergency Fund, which would award aid to low-income, minority students at the discretion of a committee of students, faculty and staff of the college.

Among its other hefty demands: $50,000 to put on an opening event that will introduce the College and its mission; $45,000 annually to serve as payment for students and faculty doing de-colonial work on campus. The group defined de-colonial work as providing space and resources to learn alternate histories, supporting students non academic work, emotional and intellectual labor that is not about publishing or service to the institution, providing often unrecognized trainings, workshops, and/or interventions on behalf of students. 

SAPL is also petitioning for the creation of a 15-person, paid student committee, called The Office for Social Transformation, to monitor, document, and archive all racist, anti- black, transphobic, cissexist, misogynistic, ablest, homophobic, islamophobic, and otherwise oppressive behavior on campus.

About 440 people have signed the petition since it went live last week.

In a statement to USA TODAY College, SAPL said that WWUs administration has not directly responded to their list of demands.

Western Washington University President Bruce Shepard, in an email statement obtained by USA TODAY College, said that the proposal would fundamentally contradict our policies, practices, mutually bargained contracts, and federal law and policy on such matters as faculty evaluation and discipline, student conduct and discipline, the investigation of alleged racist behaviors, and the planning of facilities, spaces, and residence halls. I further find, in the proposal, language possibly threatening our core commitments to campus-wide inclusivity and, again possibly, to academic freedom. The proposal, he added, is also problematic for it would have large budgetary impacts but is missing a critical component of any complete proposal; namely, a credible approach for funding.

Rousey seemed to walk to the octagon as quickly as possible and wanted to end the fight against Holm as early as possible  but Holm survived the crucial first 30 seconds of the fight with her great movement, and beat Rousey in a stand-up battle.

Rousey, who refused to touch gloves with Holm seconds before the bout, took repeated left hands to the face as Holm simply outboxed her. Rousey chased Holm all over the ring, but Rousey couldnt land any power shots and was obviously frustrated.

In the second round, Rousey took more punches and a side kick to the face. Holm ducked a wild Rousey swing, which left the champion on the ground. After Holm staggered Rousey with a punch, a spectacular head kick knocked Rousey out cold, and after Rousey crumpled to the mat a few punches from Holm forced the referee to stop the bout.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,5 great contributions George Martin made to The Beatles,"['Patrick Ryan', 'Est March', 'P M']","Beatles producer Sir George Martin, circa 1960s. (Photo: EMI)

Legendary Beatles producer George Martin died Tuesday at age 90, leaving behind an enduring, eclectic catalog of classic songs. Here are five of the many instances when Martin shaped the Fab Four:

1. He was partially responsible for Ringo Starr replacing Pete Best.

Martin was impressed by The Beatles after they auditioned for him in 1962, with the exception of original drummer Pete Best. The band's manager, Brian Epstein, fired Best shortly after and he was replaced by Ringo Starr. Talking to Melody Maker magazine in 1971, Martin elaborated: ""He never joined in with the others. He was always a bit quiet, almost surly. But the basic thing was that I didn't like his drumming, it wasn't solid and he didn't bind the group together. ... The boys had been thinking of getting rid of him anyway, but they wanted someone to do the dirty work for them.""

2. He emphasized the importance of a catchy hook.

Recording Can't Buy Me Love in 1964, Paul McCartney initially wanted to kick it off with the first verse (which begins ""I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend, if it makes you feel all right""). But as Martin told music blog JazzWax in 2012, ""I said to Paul, 'Why don't we start with the tagline at the corners?' So I designed for him the 'can't buy me love' intro that starts the song."" The strategy effectively paid off on many Beatles singles. ""People bought records in those days based on radio disc jockeys, and you had to grab the listener's attention right away,"" Martin said. ""If you could hook them, you had them.""

3. He ushered strings into their music.

McCartney originally sang 1965's Yesterday only with an acoustic guitar, but he added a string quartet to the ballad at Martin's urging. ""I'd kind of resisted his suggestion, but he very cleverly or astutely said: Lets try it. Ive got a feeling it will work, and if you dont like it we can take it off,' "" McCartney told Clash in 2009. ""I just did it on my own with George Martin and the quartet thing, and when we did that I liked it."" When the band recorded Eleanor Rigby for the album Revolver a year later, McCartney and John Lennon brought it to Martin and said they wanted to do another string arrangement, only with a much larger section.

4. He helped fuse sounds and styles on the group's boundary-pushing tracks.

Strawberry Fields Forever was recorded in sessions for the band's seminal 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, although it was instead included on Magical Mystery Tour a few months later. But the song stands out for Martin's uncanny ability to combine two very different arrangements. In his 1979 memoir All You Need Is Ears, Martin writes how the original Strawberry was a heavier rock number with drums, bass and electric guitars. A week later, Lennon came back to Martin and asked to redo the song with strings and brass, which they also recorded.

""I said, 'They're both good. But aren't we starting to split hairs?' "" Martin says. ""Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word 'split', because John's reply was: 'I like the beginning of the first one, and I like the end of the second one. Why don't we just join them together?' ""

5. He thought outside the box.

Some of Martin's most unusual yet influential work with the band was on Sgt. Pepper's. The track Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! required him to create a circus atmosphere, with a chaotic mess of sounds calling to mind rifle shots and people shouting. To do so, ""I got hold of old calliope tapes, playing Stars and Stripes Forever and other Sousa marches, chopped the tapes up into small sections and had (engineer) Geoff Emerick throw them up in the air, reassembling them at random,"" Martin said in Mark Lewisohn's The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions. ""Amazingly, they came back together in almost the same order. We all expected it to sound different, but it was virtually the same as before! So we switched bits around and turned some upside down.""

George Martin, producer of many of The Beatles' greatest hits, has died. He was 90-years-old. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more, including reaction from the band members. Buzz60

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Nancy Reagan was Old Hollywood in the White House,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Maria Puente']","President Ronald Reagan hands a pen to first lady Nancy, after he signed a major anti-drug bill on Nov. 18, 1988 at a White House. (Photo: Ron Edmonds/ AP)

That adoring gaze.

If we remember nothing else about Nancy Reagan, who died Sunday at age 94, it will be that image of a petite woman with the huge eyes, fixed like a loving laser on former President Ronald Reagan  her ""Ronnie""  whenever they were in the same room. And they were rarely apart.

Of course, it won't be the only thing we remember. She brought Old Hollywood glamour to the White House  and defended it despite criticism. She introduced the nation to her New Plutocrat pals, their social life and their spending. She helped make Oscar de la Renta a star and lit up rooms with her fire-engine red frocks.

She was a canny bureaucratic in-fighter when she needed to be: Former Reagan chief-of-staff Don Regan, who died in 2003, knew all about that, to his chagrin: He was fired, in part after clashing with Nancy.

She was a charmer when she needed to be: Too bad there's no video of her hugely successful turn singing Secondhand Clothes at the Gridiron following a mini-scandal over her perceived obsession with couture fashion.

But when it all comes down to it, Nancy Reagan will be remembered for her absolute devotion to her husband  elevating him, polishing his legacy, protecting him from any threats, even to the point of consulting an astrologer to help arrange his schedule. (That last embarrassing factoid comes courtesy of Dan Regan's scathing revenge memoir of his Reagan years.)

""That's not to say that other first ladies weren't devoted to their husbands, but few can match Nancy Reagan,"" says Myra Gutin, a first-lady historian and professor of communications at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J.

The paradox of Nancy, says Carl Anthony, historian at the National First Ladies Library, is that she was ""one of the most powerful first ladies in the post-World War II era,"" not for her policy influence (think Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton) but for her ""personal influence closely monitoring and at times managing access to the presidents decision-making process (think Edith Wilson).""

Nancy's ""single most defining public role was 'helping my husband,' "" Anthony says, a job especially important for a president who hated personal conflicts and confrontations that inevitably come to the Oval Office.

Certainly Ronald Reagan had no doubts about his most valuable asset: After all, who helped make him a Republican (he had been a Democrat) and a conservative? Who helped make him governor of California? And who helped make him POTUS?

It was always Nancy Davis Reagan, the Hollywood starlet-turned-political wife-turned First Lady of the United States, 1981-1989.

""If Nancy Davis had met Ronald Reagan earlier in his movie career, he would have gotten an Oscar  she would have insisted on it,"" says Gutin.

""The truth is, it really was a love story,"" Gutin says. ""He took precedence in her affections and actions over those of even her children, that's the strength of her dedication to him.""

Anthony describes her as ""the single greatest protective force around Ronald Reagan, not only as he rose to the presidency, but throughout his presidency.""

""There is a unique duality to her legacy: She was simultaneously a traditionalist and a maverick,"" Anthony says. ""She believed that her primary function in life was vigilant devotion to her husband, and would readily defy convention in order to do so.""

The former first lady died of congestive heart failure.

Beloved by her husband, Nancy was not always so loved by his staff or the public, especially in the early years of his presidency.

""Some people referred to her as 'the personnel director' because she always had his back in keeping tabs on how people were serving her husband,"" Gutin says. ""If she didnt think they were doing well, she was not quiet about it at all, to him or to others.""

Naturally, this didn't set well with some. She didn't really care about the criticism but she really cared if her low approval ratings (at one point as low as 19%, Gutin says) hurt her husband.

So when their first year in office was marred by controversies over her expensive tastes in renovating the White House family quarters, her hosting of fancy dinners with haute cuisine menus on the new high-end White House china she ordered (even though it wasn't taxpayer-funded), and her habit of borrowing couture fashion from friends and designers, the harrumphing in the press and polls was loud.

""By refusing to alter her agenda she appeared willfully disconnected to the nations anxiety over the enduring recession and became an unwitting caricature,"" says Anthony. ""Instead of being depicted as a First Lady to all citizens, she was cast as if she was a royal queen of only the elite class.""

""Something had to be done,"" Gutin says.

Thus, the public-relations campaign to improve her image. Thus, her star turn at the Gridiron (an ancient and exclusive clan of media pooh-bahs who annually perform skits and sing songs poking fun at politicos), when she transformed from ""Queen Nancy"" to ""Bag Lady"" overnight.

She came on stage in a mess of mismatched duds  a navy polka-dot blouse, a red print housedress and a blue Hawaiian-print skirt, yellow rubber boots, a feather boa, a long strand of pearls, and a red straw hat with feathers and flowers, according to the Reagan Library.

Then she sang Secondhand Clothes  set to the tune of Second Hand Rose  mocking herself and the medias criticism of her fashion. At the end she smashed a replica plate from the new White House china. Results: standing ovation and cries of ""Encore!""

Nancy's indifference to policy was a departure from many of her predecessors. During her husband's 1980 campaign, she aligned herself with whatever the conservative Republican base that elected him wanted. She believed her own moderate or liberal personal views didn't matter, Anthony says.

""It was only what the president believed and intended to achieve that counted,"" he says. ""Unlike her 1970s predecessors, Nancy did not consider her status  as a symbol for women  fundamental to her concept of a presidential spouse.""

When Don Regan's memoir spilled the beans on her consulting an astrologer to plan Reagan's schedule, Nancy refused to back down in the face of derision. Presidents have numerous advisers to rely on for guidance on policy but only a spouse without any hidden political agenda of their own could best ensure the physical and emotional stability of the nations leader, she argued.

While keeping an eye on how well his staff was serving him, she also provided Reagan with feedback on pending decisions or on his public remarks or speeches, Anthony says, and she felt free to contradict his conclusions or challenge his thinking.

As a result, she developed into a strong force in her own right,"" Anthony says. ""Even the political agenda of Reagans base supporters came second to the personal well-being of her husband and the reputation of his legacy.""

Nancy's main ""First Lady"" project  the Just Say No to drugs campaign  was a holdover from her tenure as first lady of California. Although mocked as somewhat naive in its prescriptions, Nancy's commitment to the cause was authentic, Anthony says.

""Over the course of her eight years in the White House, she went from simply cheering on grade-school students to addressing the U.N. General Assembly on international drug trafficking,"" he says. ""Her motivation to make it a national issue gained alacrity as experts made her increasingly conscious of how it was devastating the most vulnerable demographics.""

Years after the Reagan presidency, Nancy's rankings in polls comparing America's first ladies have crept up. Gutin cites the periodic Siena College (Loudonville, N.Y.) Survey of American First Ladies, which ranks a FLOTUS based on 10 characteristics, such as courage, value to country, leadership and accomplishments.

In the most recent survey, Nancy Reagan ranked #15 (Eleanor Roosevelt, Abigail Adams, Jacqueline Kennedy, Dolley Madison and Michelle Obama were #1 to #5 respectively).

""But she's climbed up a bit,"" Gutin says. Indeed, in the 1982 survey, she was ranked #39; in 1993, she was #36, and in 2003, she was #28. By 2008, she was #15 and that's where she remains.

These themes dictated the action in Sundays League of Alternative Baseball Reality (LABR) NL-only auction. The 12-team clash, which took place at The Arizona Republic offices, showed how scorching hot the hype was around the biggest names.

NL LABR: Rosters, auction prices

The leagues defending champ, Rotowires Derek Van Riper, made a strong push to defend his title. He bought the two most expensive players in the draft: Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, both $40.

Anthony Rizzo garnered $39 from Glenn Colton, Rick Wolf and Stacie Stern.

This highlighted a furious early stretch that all but cleaned out starting pitchers and big-name bats. Derek Carty bought the most expensive pitcher, which at $38 unsurprisingly was perennial Cy Young contender Clayton Kershaw.

Max Scherzer was the second-most expensive pitcher at $33, followed by Madison Bumgarner and Jake Arrieta at $29.

The great talent divide

A popular strategy in auctions, especially single-universe games like AL and NL LABR, involves spreading the risk. The gist: avoiding high bids in exchange for deeper lineups with more midrange talent.

In the depleted NL player pool, however, there was no reason to bypass elite moneymakers. Instead, many chose a version of the stars and scrubs plan.

Eleven hitters went for $30 or more. Nine of the 12 clubs rostered a pitcher of $24 or more. The heavy top-end bidding led to a whopping 40 $1 acquisitions.

Sidebar: Usually, a club tries an extreme strategy to capitalize on market inefficiencies. Well, its fun when two teams try the same plan.

The cheap pitching strategy had two competitors: Inside Edges Steve Moyer and Baseball HQs Doug Dennis, an almost annual employer of that strategy. Their bidding wars for low-end players provided a refreshing break to the more expensive action.

A new strategy catching on?

Moyer did his best to corner the market on catchers, buying Buster Posey for $31, then sliding him to first base after his purchases of Welington Castillo ($14) and Derek Norris ($10).

Kyle Schwarber, another notable catcher-eligible breakout candidate, went for $24. Oddly enough, hes an outfielder for Van Riper, who also collected the Mets duo of Travis d'Arnaud ($14) and Kevin Plawecki ($1).

So the top and arguably the second-best fantasy catcher will start out the year somewhere other than their most valuable fantasy position. At least theyre great insurance policies.

Carving out closers

The NLs chaotic player pool has several unsettled pictures for saves:

Atlanta: Arodys Vizcaino ($7), Jason Grilli ($4)

Miami: A.J. Ramos ($9). Carter Capps, who has a pending date with Dr. James Andrews, was not brought up on Sunday.

Colorado: Jake McGee ($9), Jason Motte (reserve rounds)

Milwaukee: Will Smith ($3), Jeremy Jeffress ($2), Corey Knebel ($2)

Philadelphia: David Hernandez ($4), Edward Mujica ($1)

Cincinnati: J.J. Hoover ($2), Tony Cingrani ($1), Jumbo Diaz (reserve)

San Diego: Fernando Rodney ($4), Kevin Quackenbush ($3), Drew Pomeranz ($2)

Already a big injury

One of the pitfalls of picking players in early March is the amount of time before the season starts. This can change the fortunes of a fantasy club, via signing or a trade, a managerial decision or, in most cases, an injury.

usatoday.com,2012-05-20 00:00:00,7 tips for surviving a group project,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Ashley Ritter', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Your teacher mentioned it at the beginning of the semester.

You probably brushed it off but it always comes back when you least expect it: group projects.

These are two of the most dreaded words that can come out of a teachers mouth, but almost every student will face one, or many, group projects throughout their college experience.

Group projects are intended to develop your leadership abilities while also providing an opportunity to show you are capable of working as part of a team.

With these seven tips, group projects no longer need to be something to stress out about or hastily throw together the night before its due.

1. Choose group members wisely

If your teacher allows you to choose your own project members, do so with consideration. If you know your friend has three jobs, an internship and a five class schedule, this probably makes your friend a poor partner to work with assuming a group project will likely not be a main priority. If you dont know anybody in the class, I suggest some light Facebook stalking and striking up conversations with surrounding peers.

2. Figure out the best means of communication

The group has been assembled. There are a myriad of ways to communicate and, as a team, it needs to be determined which ways work best for your particular group. Emails, phone calls, Facebook groups and Tweets are all great, but I highly recommend creating a Gmail account and using Google Documents.

All group members are able to collaborate on the same document simultaneously, which may even eliminate the need for some group meetings. No matter which means your group chooses, make sure to have a list of everyones name, email and phone number sent out to each member. You will regret not doing this if, while struggling to put the project together the night before its due, you realize nobody wrote the conclusion.

3. Set check-ins and deadlines

Assign each group member tasks they are responsible to complete. If you create periodic check-ins throughout the project, you will be able to ensure every member is contributing  or not contributing. These check-ins let the group come together, share their findings and discuss any problems or new ideas. Deadlines are meant to establish priorities for what needs to get done first and help eliminate panic caused by leaving work for the last minute. Always have everything in writing to avoid confusion or the frantic, I didnt know that was my job, conversation.

4. Take the lead

Dont fear stepping up and being the team coordinator or leader. If you get stuck with a group full of slackers, this is the perfect opportunity to expand your leadership skills and take control. This doesnt mean being the person who does all the work, but ensuring everything gets done on time.

Leaders also facilitate communication between members and help keep members on track. If you find yourself in the leadership role, keep an open mind and listen to everyones opinions. The best leaders can find a compromise that all group members can agree with.

5. Give a time cushion at the end of the project

People get sick, documents get deleted, group members are irresponsible. For the unexpected and unaccounted for issues, set an earlier date than the actual due date for the project to be completed. By giving the team a few extra days as a time cushion, catastrophes and dilemmas can be solved by the time of the teachers due date.

6. Dont be afraid to ask your professor for help

Asking for help does not show weakness  it proves to professors that you care about the outcome of the project and are willing to try alternative solutions to achieve success. If your research hypothesis is failing or someone is not pulling their weight, have the courage to ask your teacher for help with the next steps. As educators, pfofessors are full of guidance that you can use to move forward. After all, the teacher assigned the project, so why not pick their brain for more knowledge?

7. Stay positive

Although time consuming and at times, stressful, group projects are beneficial for providing realistic examples of what your future internship or career may entail. Coming up with an entire media strategy for a local pizza spot may later help with your prospective job in the advertising field or the public service announcement project can assist with your future in broadcast journalism. By focusing on the positives instead of the negatives, you give yourself the chance to learn the most out of each project and apply it to the real world.

Group projects dont have to be scary or cause you angst. They can be conquered and by following these tips and tricks, you can ensure your next experience will be one of your best.",[]

The former tight end who now appears on the Redskins Radio Broadcast and co-hosts a show on ESPN 980 said that Griffin hated Cousins from the moment he was drafted  something that never got better through their years in Washington together.

Via the Washington Post:

Robert was never willing to be friends with Kirk Cousins, Cooley said. They never hung out together, they never spent time together, their families didnt hang out together. ... It was never a great relationship. I dont think Robert ever wanted it to be a great relationship. And I think it became really contentious over the last two years, to where Rex Grossman, a guy who Im close with, said This is weird in here. This is a bad situation in here. These guys dont like each other.

He added that other members of the offense didnt like Griffin, from receivers to the offensive line.

Again, via the Washington Post:

The offensive line did not like Robert Griffin, Cooley said. A lot of the receivers did not like Robert Griffin. The offensive line had a problem with Robert, because they were considered for a year-and-a-half or two years a terrible offensive line that couldnt protect a quarterback. A lot of that isnt true. A lot of that was Robert. A lot of the sacks were put on Robert. Want to believe it or not, they were, okay? Football-wise, they were: it was Robert.

Whether that was true or not  a few Redskins players took to Twitter to express what appears to be their thoughts on Cooleys claims.

Brian Orakpo, an outside linebacker who was on the Redskins for 6 seasons until heading to the Titans in 2015:

And Niles Paul, Redskins tight end:

On ESPN, Ryan Clark, who played his last season in the NFL on the Redskins in 2014 dismissed Cooleys claims. First of all, like that dude, anything he says I dont necessarily pay attention to, he said, before adding later that Griffin and his teammates dont need to be friends.

usatoday.com,2014-07-23 00:00:00,Apple vs. Microsoft: The winner is...,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Coke (KO) vs. Pepsi (PEP) was the battle royale in the 1980s. Before that, auto nuts joked theyd rather push a Ford (F) than drive a Chevy (or vice versa). But today, the corporate battle thats heating up is Apple (AAPL) vs. Microsoft (MSFT).

Apples runaway success is cooling along with innovation, while Microsoft is making changes to get its mojo back. But Apples success over the past five years has put it far enough ahead that Microsoft will need to keep putting up some big numbers to catch up.

Its easy to let biases creep into the debate. Microsoft fans laugh at Apple users who actually try to work on an iPad, and Apple users scoff at Windows Phones small market share. So, lets check the opinions and biases at the door and just compare these two tech giants with cold, hard facts.

Many assume Apple is the runaway winner in most quantitative measures between the companies. But its a much closer race, in many areas, than is popularly believed. Starting with the stocks. This is a close one. Shares of Microsoft and Apple are in a dead heat this year, with shares of Apple rising 21.5% and Microsoft right behind with a 20.3% gain.

During the intermediate term, its a close battle, too. Shares of Apple are up 69.8% over the past three years, just marginally ahead of the 63.6% rise by Microsoft.

Longer term, the edge goes to Apple. Over the past five years, Apple is up 314%, which easily tops the 91% gain by Microsoft.

But enough about stocks. How about the underlying businesses? On an absolute basis, Apple indeed outstrips the size of Microsoft. But when it comes to growth, its a closer match than you might think.

During the second quarter, Apples revenue was 60% greater than Microsofts at $37.4 billion. And Apple made 68% more money than Microsoft, hitting profit of $7.7 billion during the quarter. But fans of Microsoft can counter that Microsoft has been growing more rapidly than Apple over the past 12 months. Revenue growth of Microsoft over the past 12 months is 11.5% higher than the previous 12-month period, topping the 5.2% growth of Apple during the same time. Thanks to growth of its products in their earlier days, though, Apple holds the growth record over the past five years at 32.5% a year on average, topping the 8.2% revenue growth at Microsoft.

Both of the companies are rock solid. Apple is carrying more long-term debt than Microsoft, at $29 billion, topping the $20 billion at Microsoft. And Microsoft has a higher credit rating, its one of just three companies with the highest AAA credit rating from Standard & Poors.

Also contrary to popular belief, Microsoft sold more phones than Apple did in the second quarter. Microsoft sold 36.1 million phone devices during the quarter, topping the 35.2 million phones sold by Apple, says Neowin. The trouble for Microsoft, though, is that just 5.8 million of those phones were smartphones.

And analysts like both stocks, but the average price target on Apple implies more upside: 6.4% vs. 2.2%. That might be connected with the fact Apple is cheaper with a P-E of 16, based on its adjusted earnings over the past twelve months, than Microsoft is at 17.

So there you have it Appleheads and Microsoft fanatics. Now that you have the data, you can at least fight over facts, not just opinions.

The former Chicago Bears running back agreed to a deal with the New York Jets on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.

The Jets had a need for a running back after Chris Ivory left to join the Jacksonville Jaguars. Bilal Powell, the team's second-leading rusher, was set to become a free agent.

Forte, 30, gives Jets coach Todd Bowles an established back who also can contribute in the passing game. He ran for a career-low 898 yards last season with the Bears.",[]

SAN FRANCISCO - Virtual reality headsets are exceedingly solitary devices, blocking out the real world in exchange for a lonely artificial one.

But Oculus is taking a step toward the ultimately social promise of VR. On Thursday, owners of Samsung Gear VR Powered by Oculus - the $99 device that turns smartphones into VR portals - will be able to create personal profiles that open the door to collaborative game play.

""The immersive sense of virtual reality is even more compelling with friends,"" read a blog post on the company's site Wednesday. ""Were adding new, made-for-VR games to Gear VR that let you team up with friends or compete against people from all over the world.""

Those games include Social Trivia, which allows Oculus-connected friends to play together using avatars as their stand-ins. Similarly, Herobound: Gladiators also will be available as a group game for up to four players. Another added feature is the ability to watch Twitch and Vimeo streams in a virtual room with friends via Oculus Social.

Interacting with others within VR is critical to broadening the technology's appeal beyond hardcore gamers. In contrast, augmented reality, which is expected to account for much of VR/AR revenue by 2020, provides virtual information that is projected into the user's line of sight without occluding visibility.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who engineered the company's 2014 acquisition of Oculus for $2 billion, has been an outspoken proponent of VR's ability to connect people in a way that goes far beyond a simple Facebook wall.

Pretty soon were going to live in a world where everyone has the power to share and experience whole scenes as if youre just there, Zuckerberg told a crowd at Mobile World Congress last month. Imagine being able to sit in front of a campfire and hang out with friends anytime you want (or) holding a group meeting or event anywhere in the world that you want. All these things are going to be possible.""

Oculus Rift, the company's flagship product which is powered by a computer, begins shipping soon to developers. The price is $599 for the headset, and closer to $2,000 if a PC is part of the package.

usatoday.com,2016-02-09 00:00:00,Anti-Valentine's Day: Sensational solo vacations in the Caribbean,"['Special For Usa Today', 'Melanie Reffes']","Forget the sad bouquet of roses and the pitiful box of chocolates and instead press the reset button on Valentines Day with a 'treat yourself' solo getaway under the sun. Skip the barrage of mushy stuff and join legions of independent travelers who are scaling new heights on a zip line, taking five at a yoga retreat, taking it all off on an au natural beach and generally greeting the morning in sensational single style. Bring your A-game, leave the pity party at home and make this Valentines Day your own special day in the Caribbean.

St. Maarten

Feed your soul with breakfast in bed, cocktails on the beach, dinner perched atop a cliff and a nightcap at the rooftop lounge and youll toast a new kind of Valentines Day. At the five-star, adults-only all-suite Sonesta Ocean Point Resort, posh pampering for one is sublime with the blue sea as the backdrop and views youll remember forever. Treat yourself like a queen  yes, youve earned it  and book a big comfy seafront suite, sip a sunrise espresso on the balcony, finish that trashy novel on a sun lounger, meet a gaggle of new gal pals at the Palms (Bartender Cheryl pours the finest pina coladas on the island) and make yourself at home at a cozy dinner table for one at Azul, where Chef Marc Innocenti impresses with his fabulous fusion fare. A quick cab ride from the airport at the southernmost tip of the island, a solo stay at the ultra-chic resort beats a bottle of perfume and a cookie-cutter greeting card any day of the year.

St. Martin

Muster up your courage and take it all off on Orient Beach; longest clothing-optional, party-loving sandy strand in the Caribbean. Humming with activity, the clothing-optional swath is really five beaches  Kontiki, Kakao, Bikini, Waikiki and Coco  each named after a bar with the same name. Ideal for those who prefer their birthday suit to a swim suit and for everyone else who wants it try it at least once, all youll need are a few dabs of sunscreen to enjoy a day on the two-mile long powdery strip that is sheltered from the Atlantic waves by a reef. If it turns out you prefer packing lightly, check into Club Orient, the islands only naturist resort at the south end of the beach.

Grand Bahama Island

Rather than waiting for someone to gift it to you, make your own signature scent at the Perfume Factory in Freeport; capital city of Grand Bahama Island. Located in the pretty pink and white house on West Sunrise Highway and East Mall Drive, cologne experts teach the fragrant art of blending a trio of oils into an olfactory masterpiece (you'll even get to name your creation). Founded in 1969 by a New York expat who was also a perfume buff, the tour and mixology class is a must-do for solo Valentines Day celebrators looking for their own personalized treasure to take home.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines

Who needs a bouquet of roses when you can spend all day in a green oasis full of everything fragrant? One of the oldest public gardens in the world, St Vincent and the Grenadines Botanic Gardens in the capital city of Kingstown was created in 1765 and for more than two centuries has been one of the most peaceful spots on the island. Set back a scant one mile from the city along the Leeward Highway, the garden's 20 acres are home to brightly colored flowers, plants and trees and inside the Nicholas Wildlife Aviary; the national bird called the St. Vincent Parrot is a rare sight. Trivia buffs should note that the gardens are where in 1798 Captain William Bligh made his second visit to the Caribbean  his first ended in the infamous mutiny on the Bounty  and where he introduced breadfruit which today is island-adored roasted with fried jackfish.

Paradise Island, The Bahamas

Take a walk on the wild side at the largest casino in the Caribbean. Spanning a seven-acre lagoon, Atlantis Casino in the gigantic Atlantis Resort is an innovator in casino design with 90 table games and nearly 900 slot machines where you can bet just a penny or as much as $100 on fun games like The Cleopatra and The Black & White Wild Jackpot. Over the bridge from Nassau, the ginormous casino with a Race and Sports Book for high rollers is open 24 hours a day for those who like to roll the dice and flip the cards at all hours. Put your winnings to good use with an upgrade to a spacious suite, sushi at Nobu and a jewelry shopping spree in label stores in the Crystal Court like Daniel Yurman and Rolex.

Dominican Republic

Give the buffet and the beach for a rest for an afternoon and soar to new heights high above the treetops in Punta Cana. An exhilarating challenge for the brave and the brazen, head for the hills on the easternmost tip abutting the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean where a zip lining adventure with Island Routes is a wild adrenaline rush. With the wind in your hair youll fly in the air at 40 miles per hour, boldly cross a hanging bridge and zip along eight different lines with awesome views of the jungle and ocean below.

St. Lucia

Be good to yourself at The BodyHoliday LeSport where its all about a blissful balance that blends beach, spa and healthy eating into a holiday for your body. On Cariblue Beach on the northwest tip of the island, the hip enclave invites with fitness classes, yoga, tai chi, golf, tennis and spinning in a serene, glass-enclosed studio built into a treetop. For those looking for the ultimate cleanse-yourself experience, therapists at the Body Science Clinic take an Eastern healing approach to mind and body wellness. All-inclusive perks include one spa treatment daily (we recommend the Japanese Silk Booster Facial), dining in Tao; one of the worlds hottest tables and afternoon tea in The Clubhouse. When the sun sets and the martinis kick in, tickle the ivories on the white baby grand in The Piano Bar.

Aruba

Soak like a single in charge in a big bubbly spa bath, rock stress away in a hammock and because you know youre hot, hot, hot, indulge in the herb and honey-infused body scrub in the Spa at the ritzy Ritz-Carlton at the end of the Palm Beach strip. Inspired by the islands natural potions, signature treatments use a basket of good-for-you bounty including honey, red mud, cactus, cold-pressed coconut and aloe in a menu of magical massages, rubdowns and wraps. Give yourself the Valentines Day gift of re-centering with a zero-gravity Sky massage in a swaying hammock and a two-hour relaxing rubdown called Earth that refreshes with a coconut and sea salt scrub, black stone massage and facial. Go the distance with a flute of fine champagne and a bowl of guilty-pleasure-worthy strawberries dipped in chocolate.

And wow, its strange.

At around the 24-second mark, Menzl described a foul but seemed confused near the end of his sentence. That was because a game official was yelling at him.

We can hear referee Pat Adams scream, Whos this right here? Whos this right here?

Menzl went on with calling the game, but the official asked for a game manager to throw Menzl out.

It truly was surreal to listen to as Menzl kept his cool and continued to do his job while arguing his case to the ref.

But I didnt even do anything, Menzl said.

Apparently, Adams was unhappy with a gesture Menzel made and thought he was being shown up.

Menzel explained what happened to the Green Bay Press-Gazette:

Menzl said Adams thought he was waving him off after a call went against the Phoenix. I talk with my hands, Menzl said. I was trying to describe that we had two guys fighting for the ball, and he took it as I waved him off, like saying thats a horrible call. At first he gave me a warning. Then two seconds later said, I want this guy removed and I wont start the game until he gets removed.

Menzl was replaced by the Oakland radio announcer for a couple minutes before he was allowed to return to the game.

It was a complete misunderstanding, but Adams needed to chill. There is nothing worse in college hoops than an official who makes the game about him or her. It was the semifinal of a conference tournament, and Adams was so petty as to delay the game in order to have a radio announcer removed.

Good on Menzl for handling that odd situation like a pro.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,The Nancy Reagan I knew,"['Est March', 'Ed Rollins', 'P M']","Ronald Reagan embraces wife Nancy after debating President Carter in Cleveland in 1980. (Photo: AP file photo)

With the passing of Nancy Reagan, the Reagan era has ended. The former first lady was more responsible for it than any other individual  including President Reagan. There would not have been a Reagan presidency without her, and it would not have been so successful without her role as his most important and constant adviser. There might not have been a Reagan legacy if she had not cultivated it and promoted it until she was no longer physically able. She was class personified and had great political instincts, maybe even better than his. As he told me once, he would not be president without her encouragement and guidance.

After Reagan lost the nomination to President Ford by 117 delegates at the 1976 Republican National Convention, he told me he had no desire to run again. Nancy felt differently and convinced him that for the good of the country, he had to try again. In 1984, she didn't want him to run for re-election. She felt they had accomplished all they had set out to do, and she worried every moment that something as terrifying as the attempt on his life, which he barely survived, could occur again. Once the decision was made to compete for a second term, she told me that they wanted a campaign they could be proud of. They got one, but it was their magnificent effort to bring Americans together and make them proud of this great country that unified us all and won 49 states.

The president never uttered a negative word about his opponent. Thats certainly an example that could be followed today by all who want to grab the Reagan legacy but have participated in campaign behavior that he would find appalling.

She was classy and beautiful. He was handsome, secure and confident. She was insecure and always on the lookout for danger. He was a conservative ideologue. She supported his concepts but was more than willing to look at other ideas. He was the ultimate loner, confident in his core beliefs. She was always reaching out to old friends and supporters. The telephone was her instrument of outreach, and she spent many hours daily on it feeling the pulse and opinions of people she trusted. He used the phone only when someone put a call list together for people to thank or persuade. Many of us on the White House staff dreaded her constant calls, not because she berated you but because she always asked the tough questions. And you knew that those questions were important and needed to be answered and acted upon.

Everyone who worked for President Reagan loved him and would do anything for him. We all had great affection and respect for Mrs. Reagan, and maybe a little fear, too! She was his protector. He was her rock, but she was the guardian. And loyalty to her man was the ultimate requirement. He was forgiving to many who opposed him or betrayed him in the 1976 battle. She remembered them all, and was often frustrated by Ronnie holding no grudges.

But together, they were a team. An unbeatable team. He loved her, listened to her and trusted her above all others. She loved him right back and gave him the best advice anyone could. She was the longest-serving adviser and told him what he needed to hear, not always what he wanted to hear.

I was behind them once coming out of the West Wing as they walked to the living quarters. They were in a rather heated discussion about something, and I watched him turn to her saying, ""Nancy, I heard you the first time, I heard you the second time, I don't want to hear it a third time.""

I was a little embarrassed to be overhearing this discussion and even though I was 10 yards back, I knew I was where I shouldn't be. I then was amazed to see him put his arm around her waist and as they walked to the residence elevator, she reached up and gave him a kiss on the cheek. I don't know what the discussion was about, but I'd bet real money she won the debate.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

She was an extraordinary first lady who made a giant impact with her causes such as ""Just Say No"" to drugs and her efforts on behalf of breast cancer and AIDS. She knew more about AIDS than anyone else in the administration because of her relationships with people in Hollywood. The administration was accused of being insensitive, but she certainly wasn't, and she pushed it hard.

The painful experience of sharing her husbands struggle with Alzheimers disease was the Reagans' greatest battle together and an inspiration to a nation. Her final roles as the lonely caretaker of the man who was her life and, after his death, the carrier of the Reagan torch, served this country well.

Mrs. Reagan's long and remarkable life was one of glory, adulation, defeat, humility and suffering. But at all times, she was a role model and an inspiration to this nation. Rest in peace, Mrs. Reagan, with your beloved Ronnie. You have inspired us, and we will always be grateful for your contributions.

usatoday.com,,Samsung Developing 256GB Smartphone Memory Chips,[],"Not every smartphone enjoys the luxury of expandable storage, which means even some flagships are often in danger of running out of memory.

But Samsung is hoping to change that. The company recently announced that it has been developing the industry's first 256GB memory chip, which will use the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0 standard. Until now, 128GB has been the most memory available in any mainstream device.

The new flash memory chips also take advantage of the newer USB 3.0 interface, which Samsung cites when describing the blistering transfer speeds that these chips are capable of. Thanks to USB 3.0, these chips will make transferring a 5GB, full-HD video a mere 12-second affair. Yowza.

Despite their massive capacity, these chips are also impossibly and miraculously smallsmaller than a standard micro SD card, which gives smartphone manufacturers incredible flexibility when it comes to their smartphone designs.

As other smartphone makers continue to look for ways around the issue of limited storage, Samsung is brute-forcing its way through the problem. Their work may pay off for other brands, as well: Apple and others have sourced memory from the Korean giant in the past, so it's not a huge leap to suggest that these 256GB chips could end up in future iPhones.

One thing's for sure: There's no longer an excuse for companies to offer 16GB base smartphone models (yes, that means you, Apple).",[]

Former World Anti-Doping President Dick Pound took both the Russian track and field federation and embattled tennis player Maria Sharapova to task at an anti-doping summit in London on Wednesday.

Pound, who headed up an 11-month independent WADA investigation into the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF), told those at the event that Russia is simply ""rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic"" in the aftermath of the report that showed state-sponsored doping and led to a provisional ban of ARAF by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

""My guess is Russia may not make it back for Rio. The IAAF and WADA are not going to risk their reputations by rolling over and playing dead,"" Pound said at an anti-doping conference.

As for Sharapova, Pound said she absolutely deserves to be banned. Sharapova announced Monday that she tested positive for meldonium, a Latvian drug that is used to treat ischemia, a lack of blood flow to an organ, and neurodegenerative disorders. The drug, which can increase oxygen uptake and boost endurance, was put on WADAs prohibited list on Jan. 1.

Sharapova said a doctor had prescribed the drug to her and she had taken it for a decade to treat a magnesium deficiency. Sharapova has been banned provisionally and could see a suspension of up to four years for the violation.

In the case of Maria Sharapova, youre running a $30 million operation knowing that only exists if she remains eligible to compete, Pound said. How stupid can you be? What was she thinking of and her advisors?

""If youre taking medicine, surely you or someone else around you checks if its on the list. Its not that difficult for one of her medical team to look and go 'this is a problem.'

Sharapova has lost several sponsors in recent days, including Nike, TAG Heuer, Porsche.",[]

SAN FRANCISCO  Intel took another step into what CEO Brian Krzanich has called the digitization of sports with the purchase of Israeli 3D video technology firm Replay Technologies on Wednesday.

Intel has been focusing on finding new technologies that make use of its chips and has been working with Tel Aviv-based Replay since 2013. The company's technology was part of Krzanich's keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.

Intel did not say how much it planned to pay for the company, but Israeli newspaper Haaretz put it at $175 million.

The Replay team will focus on advancing its technology with Intel to deliver faster video processing and new features, senior vice president of Intel Wendell Brooks said in a blog post.

Technology now plays an unprecedented role in sports ... and were just getting started, he said.

Intel plans to build out a new category of sports entertainment that it calls immersive sports, aimed at both fans and athletes and coaches because of its ability to capture, analyze and share data, Brooks wrote.

Replay was founded in 2011 and last month raised $13.5 million in funding. Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, also holds a stake in the company.

At an NBA All-Star weekend in February, Intel used Replays free dimensional or freeD video on TV and online. The tech creates a seamless 3D video rendering of the court using 28 ultrahigh-definition cameras positioned around the arena and connected to Intel-based servers. This system allowed broadcasters to give fans a 360-degree view of key plays, Brooks wrote.

Replay won an Emmy award in 2014 for its technical work with the New York Yankees baseball team.

If you are not so fortunate as to have this option, here are some other pointers:

Looking for a Motor City miracle

John Kasich greets supporters after speaking at a campaign event at Monroe County Community College in Monroe, Mich., on March 7, 2016. (Photo: Tannen Maury, European Pressphoto Agency)

Once upon a time, Michigan was must-win territory for John Kasich, the governor of neighboring Ohio. Kasich had hoped he could do well in Midwest primaries to stake a claim to being the best ""establishment"" alternative to Trump.

You can pick your polls here: NBC News/The Wall Street Journalreported Sunday that Donald Trump is up by large margins in Michigan with Cruz in second and Kasich trailing badly; on Monday there was a new Monmouth University poll showing Trump's lead shrinking by the day with Kasich close on his heels. We here at USA TODAY believe there is a 50-50 chance one of these polls is accurate.

Our colleague Chrissie Thompson of the Cincinnati Enquirer, who has been trailing Kasich all over creation, writes that Kasich needs to perform well in the Michigan primary to assure his home-state voters  who cast primary ballots March 15  that he is a viable choice.

Same goes for Marco Rubio, who saw his support erode dramatically in the Louisiana primary and other GOP contests last week. Rubio got some bragging rights by winning Sunday's Puerto Rico primary by a huge margin, taking 71% of the vote. But he still has not won a primary on the continental landmass (his only victory was the Minnesota caucuses on Super Tuesday), and, like Kasich, he faces a do-or-die moment in his home-state primary March 15. A good showing in Michigan would help.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both been spending a good deal of time in Michigan, in part because of the debate on Sunday night that was organized to bring attention to the drinking water crisis in Flint. Clinton has been far ahead in pre-primary polls, but the gap has been closing. Sanders would be pleased if she wins in a squeaker, thrilled if he can pull out a victory.

Most Michigan polls close at 8 p.m. ET, except for those that close an hour later in four counties in the Upper Peninsula that are in the Central time zone.

Clear as Mississippi mud

Hillary Clinton speaks at a reception for the Michigan Democratic Party at the MGM Grand Hotel in Detroit on March 5, 2016. (Photo: Tannen Maury, European Pressphoto Agency)

The Republican race here is a bit more of a question mark. There is not a lot of polling; what there is suggests a big lead for Trump. But in Louisiana's Saturday primary, Trump's victory was by less than four percentage points, as late-deciding voters appeared to be trending away from him and Rubio and toward Cruz.

Trump held a rally in the state Monday evening. Cruz canceled a Monday Mississippi event, apparently because he was not feeling well. At the last minute he then added a stop in the state Monday afternoon.

If Trump's leads have dwindled in Mississippi and Michigan, he may be feeling a lot better Wednesday.

Things are clearer on the Democratic side. The Mississippi primary should be a cakewalk for Clinton, if the rest of her performance in the South is any indication. She has been crushing Sanders among black voters in general and in Southern states where African Americans make up a significant chunk of the primary electorate. In primaries in neighboring Alabama and Louisiana, Clinton took more than 70% of the vote.

Polls close at 7 p.m. Central time.

GOP's gem in the mountains

There has only been one poll in the Idaho Republican primary, and it doesn't seem very helpful. The poll released Sunday by Idaho Politics Weekly shows Trump up over Cruz 30%-19%, but the poll was taken Feb. 17-26  before Ben Carson dropped out of the race. Carson took 11% in the poll.

Cruz and Rubio both campaigned in the state over the weekend; Trump has not been in the state but gave a shout-out to Idaho potatoes at a rally Monday in North Carolina.

The Democrats caucus in Idaho on March 22.

Polls close at 8 p.m Mountain time, and an hour later for the part of the state that's in the Pacific time zone.

Hawaii does have Republicans

Hawaii is generally Democratic territory. The governor, both U.S. senators and both members of Congress are Democrats, and Ted Cruz this week touted an endorsement from ""the only Republican serving in the state Senate.""

But there are still Republicans in paradise, and reports are that turnout is expected to be high for Tuesday's caucuses. Andrew Walden, chair of the party's caucus committee, said the campaigns have all been active on the islands, with endorsements from local officials and surrogates hosting events. Walden said former candidate Rick Santorum made a trip to Hawaii campaign on behalf of Marco Rubio.

East Coasters might have to wait a while for results: The caucuses wrap up at 8 p.m. local time, Walden said the first results should be in by 8:30, but it will likely be midnight before the last results are reported. That's like Thursday afternoon in New York. (That's an exaggeration. It's 5 a.m. Wednesday.)

Democrats caucus in Hawaii on March 26.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,4 silly mistakes youre making on your cover letter,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'The Muse', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Alexandra Samuels', 'Sam Lisker', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today']","Bad news for anyone who ever applies to work for me: I still read cover letters. (Ugh, I know right, Im such a dinosaur.)

In fact, its the first part of an application that I look at because its the fastest way to see if you put any effort into applying for this specific position. There are a few things I can figure out within seconds thatll determine if youre getting interviewedor if youre getting kicked into the no pile.

However, even when people take the effort to nail this part of the process, it can still backfire. And that stinks because writing a customized cover letter takes a lot of energy, and if youre taking the time to do that, you deserve to get an interview.

So, what are the things youre so close to doing right  but missing the mark on? Let me tell you!

1. You Addressed it to Me, But Spelled My Name Wrong

Nothing gets me more excited to dig in than seeing you address me by my name and not by Hiring Manager or To Whom it May Concern. However, nothing makes me pause faster than seeing my name spelled incorrectly. Trust me, I know, its tricky. This isnt the way Jennis typically spelled. I also know Maier has one too many vowels in a row. Nevertheless, my names all over the internet (and by that I mean our company team page and LinkedIn), so its pretty easy to look up.

Im not saying this because Im an egomaniac, but because those small, tiny details make a surprisingly big impression. If you cant get this basic task right, how can I trust you to handle more complicated matters? And yes, Im going on the assumption that every job you apply to will be more involved than spelling names correctly.

Seriously, its well worth double checking the spelling of a name before you hit send. And while youre at it, do the same for every single word you typed. Especially the companys name. (Yes, really, youd be amazed.)

2. You Started With an Interesting Opening Line, But Its Completely Unrelated to Anything

Most cover letters kick off by stating the obvious: My name is [X] and Im applying for the [open position] at [the company]. To which I usually respond, Duh. So its always a treat when a candidate starts with a fun fact, a memorable anecdote, or a clever line. By doing this, you immediately have my attention.

With that said, that fun fact, memorable anecdote, or clever line better connect with your relevant qualifications, the position youre applying for, or at the very least, the industry in general. Writing The first thing you should know about me is that I have a Full Housetribute tattoo will keep me reading, but at the end my question wont be, How fast can I get this person into interview? but rather, Where is this tattoo? Did both Olsens make the cut? and Why am I being forced to think about Bob Saget right now?

If coming up with crafty transitions isnt your thingand thats OK!cut yourself a break from all the brainstorming and instead use one of these awesome cover letter openings. (Or, go above and beyond and consult with a cover letter expert to help you perfect yours.)

3. You Talked a Lot About the Company, But You Forgot to Talk About Yourself

So, you love the company youre applying to work for and you want to make sure the hiring manager understands that. Great! People really do truly appreciate when you take the time to customize your cover letter when everyone else is phoning it in.

But, before you wax poetic for 10,000 words about how much you appreciate the organizations new green initiative, make sure youre remembering to talk about yourself and why youd fit in perfectly with this environmentally-friendly group. Maybe you launched a recycling program at your current job, or maybe you volunteer to clean parks on the weekend, or maybe your job now involves alternative energy. Whatever it may be, make sure you connect the dots for the person reading it. Hiring managers arent just looking for fans, theyre looking for people who will continue making the company great.

Trust me: While people love being reminded why their companies are awesome, it doesnt make you memorable at all.

4. You Proactively Brought Up Resume Red Flags, But Nothing Else

While you may be able to sneak some exaggerations about your qualifications into your materials, youll eventually get caught. (Either during the interview process, or worse, on the first day of your new job when youre asked to translate for a Spanish-speaking client because you listed conversational Spanish as a skill.) So, its good to be as honest as possible from the start about you canand cannotdo.

However, that doesnt mean you should waste this valuable space explaining away all the holes in your application. Heres the thing: If youre truly unqualified, you wont be called in for the interview. That means theres no need to spend any time with statements like, Youll probably notice Ive never managed anyone before... or While I may not know how to use Photoshop... (And yes, this still applies even if you throw in, ...but Im a fast learner. Never in the history of job descriptions has anyone ever written, slow learners preferred. Lets always assume you learn at the speed of light.)

If youre just missing a desired skill or two, then focus on the part of the job description that you do excel at. While you shouldnt channel your inner Kanye in your cover letter, or ever really, you should use this space to make sure you sound your best. As Muse writer Lily Zhang says in an article about feeling underqualified for a job, instead of drawing attention to your weaknesses, a better way to move on to your qualifications is to state your skills and ability to contribute directly. Stay positive, focus on your strengths, and immediately launch into your transferable skills and infectious enthusiasm for the position.(Oh, and if youre missing a whole lot more than one or two of the listed requirements, then this probably isnt the right position for you.)

If youve committed any of the above mistakes, dont worry. The fact youre even customizing your materials at all instantly puts you leaps and bounds ahead of other candidates. Now you just to have to make that last, little push that wont just put you ahead of the competitionbut places you at the very front of the pack.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 21:15:11+00:00,Reggie Miller is tired of ex-NBA players ripping Warriors: We need to embrace change,"['Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Andrew Joseph']","NEW YORKReggie Miller is putting his foot down.

The former Pacers star and Hall of Famer has seen his fellow NBA alumni like Cedric Ceballos and Oscar Robertson rip the Warriors as Golden State marches toward what could be one of the greatest seasons in NBA history.

But Miller, who spoke to For The Win at Tuesdays CBS-Turner NCAA Tournament Media Day, is tired of both his former colleagues taking shots at Steph Curry and Co., and at the media for asking Hall of Famers how theyd fare against the 2015-16 Warriors.

As old time guys and former players, we have to embrace change. Its hard for old players to embrace change because whether you played in the 70s, 80s, 90s, [we all had] different rules. Basketball has evolved and it has changed, he said. Change is good and weve got to embrace Steph and what hes doing.

He went on to point out how the comparisons to the Michael Jordan-led Bulls might be where players and experts are getting stuck.

Youve got a team that shoots a lot of threes thats almost as brash as those Bulls teams and we dont want to accept that. Weve got to let that go, Miller said. We dont want to let go of Michael Jordan. Its okay! He will still be great. We will still view him and that team as the greatest ever. Its just that theres a new kid on the block.

Miller did join the chorus of former players who thought he could top Curry when he told The New Yorker in December, All truly great shooters ... we always believed that we were the best shooters in the world. So, yeah, Id take down Steph at my peak. Sure, my form wasnt as good as his. But its all about results, man.

But he had this message to the media when it comes to questioning ex-players:

Its not fair to put a microphone in front of Oscar Robertson and ask him, Well, how do you think you would have fared against Steph? What made Isiah [Thomas], Oscar, Magic [Johnson Hall of Famers was their competitive edge. Its not fair to ask, Do you think you could stop Steph? So when they ask me, am I going to say, No, I cant shoot it against Steph?'

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,Major milestones mark 'Downton Abbey' finale,"['Est March', 'Bill Keveney', 'A M']","Take a look back at some of the most memorable moments from 'Downton Abbey,' the hit PBS show that captivated fans for six seasons. VPC

The fate of Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) was a major story in 'Downton Abbey's' series finale Sunday. (Photo: Nick Briggs, Carnival Film & Television Limited)

Spoiler alert: This story contains details about Sunday's Downton Abbey finale.

Downton Abbey, the top-rated PBS drama and a cultural phenomenon, ended its six-season run Sunday with an array of beginnings: a wedding, a birth, a pregnancy and budding relationships, both personal and professional.

As the curtain fell on life at the English estate, star-crossed Anna (Joanne Froggatt) and Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) became parents; Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) revealed her pregnancy; her husband, Henry (Matthew Goode), and Tom (Allen Leech) opened an auto dealership; and Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) formed a butler's bond with the ailing Mr. Carson (Jim Carter).

But the Masterpiece series' most-welcome arrival may have been happiness for the ever-disappointed Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), who married Bertie (Harry Hadden-Paton), the 7th Marquess of Hexham, moving past her family members in social ranking and wealth.

""There would have been an outcry if she hadn't"" had a happy ending, says Carmichael, now appearing on the London stage in The Maids. In the United Kingdom, ""the finale aired on Christmas Day. I was getting a lot of text messages from people delighted at the end of Christmas Day to see her in a white dress.""

The Edith-Bertie reunion was secretly set up by her sister Mary, who helped drive the couple apart in the penultimate episode by revealing that Marigold is Edith's out-of-wedlock daughter.

""It's not the great mass apology. It's quietly done, Mary not wanting to lose face. But you can see she does feel terrible about what's happened,"" Carmichael says. After marrying Henry, ""Mary is in a better place to extend an olive branch.""

Downton creator and writer Julian Fellowes wanted a triumphant outcome for Edith, the middle Crawley sister.

""That seemed the right thing after all she had gone through. In a way, her journey was the journey of adjustment her class had to make. She was more resilient in many ways than Mary and as advanced, by the end, as Sybil had been,"" he says.

Change  in women's roles, class relationships, educational opportunities, technology and transportation  marked the tumultuous times of Downton, which spanned the period from 1912 to 1925. It threatens the servants' jobs and the future of the Crawleys' upstairs-downstairs family. But it also presents opportunity.

""We see the positivity of education. We see how it improved Daisy's lot and how Molesley is now seeing it in his own future as a schoolteacher,"" executive producer Gareth Neame says.

Not everyone embraces moving forward: Regal matriarch Violet (Maggie Smith), in the series' final bit of dialogue, regrets not being able to remain in the past: ""If only we had the choice.""

Says Neame: ""It seemed absolutely appropriate that Maggie Smith's character should have the final word.""

The Crawleys and their staff are generally in good stead as they say goodbye, at least for now. (No spinoffs are planned, but executive producers and cast members say they're interested in making a feature film.)

""I wanted a warm ending and not to make anyone unhappy. We'd done that"" with earlier tragedies, Fellowes says. ""I wanted (viewers) to reach for their handkerchiefs in appreciation ... not because something ghastly had happened.""

usatoday.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Clash over iPhone redefines Steve Jobs' company,"['Est March', 'Jon Swartz', 'A M']","Apple CEO Tim Cook at a company product event Sept. 9, 2015, in San Francisco. (Photo: Monica Davey, European Pressphoto Agency)

CUPERTINO, Calif.  Shrugging off a grueling week that left his voice weary and body slightly slumped, Tim Cook glowed when an investor broached the topic of Apple's showdown with the FBI during its shareholders meeting here earlier this month.

Bolting straight and adding timbre to his soft Southern accent, Apple's (AAPL) CEO explained why so much is at stake in fighting the FBI's request it unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.

""We are a staunch advocate of privacy,"" Cook said. ""We do these things because they are right.""

In public settings, letters and testimony, Cook has been using the pulpit of Apple to emerge as one of the world's most outspoken corporate executives on privacy and other social issues.

For Cook and Apple, taking on the government is fraught with risk. The U.S. often wins legal conflicts with individual companies. But there is an upside to Cook's gambit: It's good for business  buyers of Apple's high-end electronic devices are sticklers for privacy, especially those overseas  and it has cemented Cook's status as the tech industry's leading voice for protecting the personal data of consumers.

Before Cook, Apple was a company that reflected the passion of Steve Jobs: The news that emanated from Cupertino, Calif., was product launch, product launch, product launch. The rare Jobs interview was comprised of him commenting on a new gizmo, and nothing else.

Today the narrative has changed dramatically, and Cook is a willing participant. Apple arguably is defined as much now by its legal fight with the government as its next iPhone.

When Apple unveils its new iPhone the week of March 21, as expected, it will be the second-most important piece of news that week. On March 22, Apple and the FBI face off in federal court.

Indeed, the government's gambit is influenced, in part, by rumors of an ultra-secure iPhone that would be next to impossible to crack, say security experts.

""It is an escalating game of security, with dangerous consequences, if the government loses before such an iPhone goes to market,"" says Nathan Wenzler, executive director of security at computer-security start-up Thycotic.

A privacy crusader

Cook, 55, took over leadership of Apple in late 2011, after the death of Steve Jobs, the companys iconic co-founder. Apple was as infused with the brains, heart and soul of Jobs as Walt Disney personified his Magic Kingdom.

At the time, Cook was well-regarded as a private, behind-the-scenes operations wizard who would assume a caretakers role at Apple, extending Jobs legacy. But unlike Jobs  who rarely made political statements or shared his opinion on current events  Cook clearly expressed his views on privacy, the environment, gay rights, diversity and discrimination.

As far back as 2010, Cook said privacy was paramount at Apple. The company has always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley, he said that year. By late 2013, Apple made all third-party data stored on customers phones encrypted by default.

Apple's resolve hardened after Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the National Security Agency's surveillance program and the embarrassing disclosure, in late 2014, that hackers broke into the Apple accounts of a number of celebrities, stole their nude photos and leaked them on the Internet. Apple strengthened its security.

""Tim Cook is the most influential tech executive in the post-Snowden firmament,"" says Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""Through personal beliefs, news events and the importance of privacy to Apple's business, he is the industry's chief advocate.""

Apple's hardline on privacy is seen as smart business sense, especially in China, its second-largest market.

But here, the profile of Cook as a staunch privacy advocate gets a little blurrier. Apple has been criticized for moving some of its Chinese customers' data onto servers run by state-run China Telecom, a shift seen as making it more possible for the Chinese government to gain access to user data. Apple contends it made the move to increase data speeds and that the data is encrypted and off-limits to China Telecom.

At the same time, the level of encryption in recent iPhones has helped make it a favored brand among Chinese consumers who are more suspicious of state-owned device makers' complicity with the Chinese government.

The upshot, says Silicon Valley futurist Paul Saffo, is a delicate balancing act Apple plays in China.

Personal convictions have also been part of the Apple/Cook calculus on privacy. In 2014, he revealed he was gay, the first publicly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company. At the time, he said he was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. to set aside his own privacy to do something more important.""

Last year, he wrote an editorial decrying an Indiana law that protected state business owners from being sued over declining services to gays and lesbians.

""What Cook is doing is proving Apple is not just a company of great products, but one of principle,"" says Lisa Joy Rosner, chief marketing officer at information-services company Neustar. Its analysis of internal data about Apple consumers portrays them as vigilant about privacy and secure devices, she says.

Thats very much the role Tim Cooks Apple has taken on as it grapples with the U.S. government in the courts and in the public eye.

""Had the dispute involved an Android phone, Google would be the leading voice. If a Microsoft phone, them,"" says Phil Dunkelberger, former CEO of PGP, a pioneer in encryption technology.

""Cook is echoing the industry, and taken the mantle,"" Dunkelberger says. ""He's our voice.""

usatoday.com,2015-05-28 00:00:00,Inside America's secretive biolabs,"['Nick Penzenstadler', 'Usa Today', 'Alison Young']","Probe identifies over 200 biolabs From New York city to a valley in Montana

Share This Story 2,284 Share Email

Vials of bioterror bacteria have gone missing. Lab mice infected with deadly viruses have escaped, and wild rodents have been found making nests with research waste. Cattle infected in a university's vaccine experiments were repeatedly sent to slaughter and their meat sold for human consumption. Gear meant to protect lab workers from lethal viruses such as Ebola and bird flu has failed, repeatedly.

A USA TODAY Network investigation reveals that hundreds of lab mistakes, safety violations and near-miss incidents have occurred in biological laboratories coast to coast in recent years, putting scientists, their colleagues and sometimes even the public at risk.

Oversight of biological research labs is fragmented, often secretive and largely self-policing, the investigation found. And even when research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security breaches  as more than 100 labs have  federal regulators keep their names secret.

Of particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working with the world's most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs  the two highest levels of containment that have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Yet there is no publicly available list of these labs, and the scope of their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state health departments charged with responding to disease outbreaks. Even the federal government doesn't know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office has warned for years.

A team of reporters who work for the USA TODAY Network of Gannett newspapers and TV stations identified more than 200 of these high-containment lab facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia operated by government agencies, universities and private companies. They're scattered across the country from the heart of New York City to a valley in Montana; from an area near Seattle's Space Needle to just a few blocks from Kansas City's Country Club Plaza restaurant and shopping district.

High-profile lab accidents last year with anthrax, Ebola and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the discovery of forgotten vials of deadly smallpox virus at the National Institutes of Health raised widespread concerns about lab safety and security nationwide and whether current oversight is adequate to protect workers and the public. Wednesday the Department of Defense disclosed one of its labs in Utah mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax -- instead of killed specimens  to labs across the USA plus a military base in South Korea where 22 people are now being treated with antibiotics because of their potential exposure to the bioterror pathogen. As many as 18 labs in nine states received the samples, the CDC said Thursday.

""What the CDC incidents showed us ... is that the very best labs are not perfectly safe,"" says Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology. ""If it can happen there, it certainly can happen anywhere.""

Some people find little reassurance that nobody was sickened in the CDC accidents or in the historically low numbers of serious infections among lab workers generally, or that infections spreading into communities surrounding labs have been rarer still.

""Many of us think that's really a matter of good fortune,"" said Beth Willis, who chairs a citizen lab advisory panel in Frederick, Md., home to one of the nation's largest high-containment research campuses at the Army's Fort Detrick.

You're talking about something that has the ability to take off and we could not be confident of being able to contain it. David Relman, microbiology professor at Stanford

The country's best labs have robust safety programs, said Kenneth Berns, co-chair of a panel of outside lab safety advisers currently examining biosafety at CDC and other federal labs. Yet the systemic safety problems identified at the CDC's prestigious labs have raised questions about what's happening elsewhere. ""It's a matter of some concern,"" said Berns, a distinguished professor emeritus of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida.

The consequences could be devastating if accidents were to occur with lab-created strains of deadly influenza viruses that are purposely engineered to be easier to spread than what's found in nature, said David Relman, a microbiology professor at Stanford University who is a federal adviser on lab safety and a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

""You're talking about something that has the ability to take off, and we could not be confident of being able to contain it,"" he said.

Relman said that not enough is known about the state of safety at labs that perform infectious disease research but emphasized that the kinds of labs drawing concern are the same ones the public needs to discover important new treatments and vaccines. ""We have to find some happy blend of minimized risk and enhanced benefit,"" he said.

Looking for a cure Daily handling of deadly pathogens like Ebola, plague, anthrax

At the high-containment labs identified by USA TODAY, experiments are underway involving drug-resistant tuberculosis, exotic strains of flu, the SARS and MERS viruses, plague, anthrax, botulism, ricin and the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, according to interviews and more than 20,000 pages of internal lab safety records and incident reports obtained from labs across the country.

Studies are also being done on a wide range of bioterrorism pathogens that are less known to the public, such as the agents that cause exotic diseases like tularemia, Q fever and melioidosis. Still others are focused on pathogens that pose serious economic risks to agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and ""mad cow"" disease.

A USA TODAY Network investigation identifies more than 200 biosafety level 3 and 4 lab facilities that work with dangerous pathogens -- and reveals safety records that some of them fought to keep secret. (USA NEWS, USA TODAY)

At a few labs, experiments have been done with strains of flu and other viruses purposely made to be more dangerous in studies that seek to understand how they might mutate naturally. White House science advisers called for a temporary halt of that kind of ""gain of function"" research last fall while expert scientific panels spend the next year studying its risks and benefits.

The research at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs  which use special equipment, negative air pressure and numerous safety and security procedures  seeks to better understand how organisms cause disease and ways to protect against them. It's the kind of work that the public doesn't give much thought to until people with Ebola arrive on planes in the United States from an outbreak in Africa, or the current avian flu outbreak forces farmers to kill millions of chickens raising the specter of higher egg prices.

It's impossible to obtain a full accounting of lab accidents or lab-acquired infections because there is no universal, mandatory requirement for reporting them and no system to analyze trends to assess emerging biosafety risks and disseminate lessons learned on a regular basis.

The Federal Select Agent Program, which inspects and regulates the subset of research labs that experiment with about four dozen types of pathogens deemed to pose bioterror threats, requires labs to report potential exposure or release incidents, as well as thefts or losses of specimens.

From 2006 through 2013, labs notified federal regulators of about 1,500 incidents with select agent pathogens and, in more than 800 cases, workers received medical treatment or evaluation, limited public data in program annual reports show. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections and there were three unintended infections of animals, according to the reports, which do not identify labs and mostly provide aggregated counts of incidents by type. Reported incidents involve events ranging from spills to failures of personal protective equipment or mechanical systems to needle sticks and animal bites.

The program, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, refuses to release copies of detailed incident reports, citing a 2002 bioterrorism law.

Incident records the USA TODAY Network obtained directly from individual labs provide a window on the kinds of mistakes that happen. An animal caretaker in Georgia was potentially exposed to a bird flu virus that kills 60% of the people it infects when a defective respirator hose supplying purified air detached from its coupling in September. A researcher in Wisconsin was quarantined for seven days in 2013 after a needle stick with a version of the same H5N1 influenza virus. A lab worker in Colorado failed to ensure specimens of the deadly bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping them in May 2014 to a co-worker in a lower-level lab who handled them without critical protective gear. None of the workers was infected.

The public and the lab community tend to learn only about the rare instances of serious or fatal lab infections, which sometimes are published as case reports in scientific journals or make national news.

In 2009, Malcolm Casadaban, a University of Chicago scientist with an underlying medical condition, died from an infection with a weakened strain of plague bacteria. In 2012, 25-year-old researcher Richard Din died after being infected during vaccine research involving Neisseria meningitides bacteria at a lab inside San Francisco's VA medical center. Both of their deaths involved research in biosafety level 2 labs, where pathogens are considered to be less dangerous than those worked with in high-containment labs.

Din, who became a researcher to cure diseases like the cancer that killed his mother, developed a fever and started feeling dizzy while out to dinner with friends. He had no idea how serious his symptoms were, his friends and family told USA TODAY. By morning, Din was covered in a splotchy rash and could barely talk, recalled Lawrence Tsai, who raced to Din's apartment to help.

Tsai carried his friend down two flights of stairs and drove him to the hospital. ""His body was very hard, very straight,"" Tsai said. ""Only his eyes were open. He could not say anything.""

A few hours later, Din was dead. And Tsai said he and his friends were told they, too, were at risk and needed to take antibiotics because of their close contact with him. The bacteria that killed Din can spread from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. About two dozen emergency room workers also were treated with antibiotics as a precaution, according to a presentation about the case at a scientific conference. Nobody else was sickened.

Federal workplace safety investigators, who investigated because the case involved a death, said Din died because the VA failed to adequately supervise and protect workers in the research lab. Among the ""serious"" issues they cited: Din and other workers in the lab were manipulating specimens of the dangerous bacteria out on tabletops  not inside protective biosafety cabinets that would have reduced potential exposures to droplets or splashes. The lab also failed to train workers about warning signs of infection, violation records show.

Spreading into the community While rare, an accidental release could be a disaster

Although lab-created outbreaks that spread to people or animals in the surrounding community are rare, they have happened.

""That's what you would worry about,"" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, of the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent think tank that studies biosecurity and epidemics. ""But even then the consequences up to now have been limited to the very close contacts of the person who was infected.""

A small, deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2004 was traced to lab workers at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. In 2007, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease among cattle in England that required herds to be slaughtered was blamed on leaking drainage pipes at a nearby research complex.

In Louisiana, tests are underway to make sure a deadly bioterror bacterium hasn't colonized the soil and water around the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans. Late last year, the bacteria got out of one of the center's BSL-3 labs, likely hitching a ride on workers' clothing, sickening two monkeys that lived in outdoor cages and later infecting others. Tulane will spend the next five years testing its outdoor monkey colony as well as wildlife and feral cats around the 500-acre facility to ensure the bacteria haven't contaminated the environment. The CDC and Tulane say they think the bacteria spread only inside the center's buildings, and so far tests outdoors have not detected the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause severe and difficult-to-treat illness in people and animals infected by coming into contact with contaminated soil or water.

On a global scale, a lab accident is considered by many scientists to be the likely explanation for how an H1N1 flu strain re-emerged in 1977 that was so genetically similar to one that had disappeared before 1957 it looked as if it had been ""preserved"" over the decades. The re-emergence ""was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source,"" according to a 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.

However, most pathogens studied in labs, unlike the flu, don't spread easily from person to person. Often, to become infected a person needs to have direct contact with a pathogen, which is why lab workers are most at risk, experts said. For example, people can become infected with anthrax by inhaling the bacterium's spores, but once sickened they are not contagious, according to the CDC.

I don't think the public needs to be too concerned ... There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place. Marian Downing, president, American Biological Safety Association

""I don't think the public needs to be too concerned,"" said Marian Downing, president of the American Biological Safety Association. ""There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place.""

Beyond accidental lab-associated outbreaks, federal auditors consider the deliberate theft and misuse of a deadly pathogen to be one of the most significant risks of biolab research. That's what the FBI says happened in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17. Bruce Ivins, a biologist and anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Md., was the perpetrator, the FBI concluded.

The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has issued repeated warnings since 2007 that the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased the aggregate risk of accidental or intentional releases of viruses, bacteria or toxins.

No single agency tracks the overall number or location of these labs, the GAO has said. Little is known about high-containment labs working with dangerous pathogens such as tuberculosis, the MERS virus and others that aren't on the select agent list and tracked by the Federal Select Agent Program.

National standards for constructing and operating these kinds of labs are lacking, which means labs vary by local building requirements. While voluntary guidance exists for safe lab design and operations, the GAO has found it is not universally followed.

The documents obtained by USA TODAY show power failures at BSL-3 labs at Texas A&M University repeatedly resulted in the labs losing their negative air pressure during 2013, a key safety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. The CDC's labs in Atlanta also have had airflow problems over the years, the newspaper previously reported.

""The public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have disastrous consequences,"" the GAO's Nancy Kingsbury told Congress at a hearing on the CDC lab incidents last summer.

Lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program  whose departments often fund the research they oversee  would not grant interviews despite repeated requests since last year. The program oversees about 262 organizations that operate BSL-3 and eight organizations that operate BSL-4 labs.

The two federal agencies that jointly run the program  the CDC and USDA  operate their own labs, which have been involved in recent high-profile incidents.

""We believe the current system of inspecting/overseeing laboratories is adequate, but we are always open to continued improvements,"" the CDC said in an emailed statement. USDA officials also declined to be interviewed.

Lab safety officials at the National Institutes of Health, a major research funding agency that operates its own labs and helps set national biosafety guidelines, also declined interview requests.

""There is no 'zero-risk' proposition in the conduct of research,"" the agency said in a statement. ""NIH works extremely hard to minimize all research-related risks.""

Lab failures kept hidden Key details of enforcement actions are secret

More than 100 labs experimenting with potential bioterror agents have been cited by regulators at the CDC and USDA for serious safety and security failings since 2003, USA TODAY has learned.

Yet so much of select agent oversight is cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to assess regulators' effectiveness in ensuring safety. In several instances, troubled labs and even federal regulators appeared to misrepresent the significance of the government's enforcement efforts.

Since 2003, the CDC has referred 79 labs for potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. It has levied fines against 19 of them totaling more than $2.4 million, the CDC said in response to questions.

Some are repeat offenders. Five labs have had ""multiple referrals"" for enforcement actions, the CDC said. Two labs have been kicked out of the program, and five labs have been suspended from doing any select agent research, the agency said.

Which labs repeatedly failed to address safety problems? The CDC won't name names  not even for the two labs kicked out of the select agent program. The CDC and its regulatory partners at the USDA say the 2002 bioterrorism law requires keeping this information secret.

Yet earlier this year, the CDC publicly announced its suspension of the Tulane National Primate Research Center  after the center's accidental release of a bioterror bacterium became publicly known and was the subject of news reports. The CDC said it balances the public's right to transparency with the risk posed by information being made available to those who might use it to threaten public health or security.

Currently seven labs are under the extra scrutiny of a federal select agent lab performance improvement program, the CDC said. The program is offered as a voluntary alternative to suspension or other regulatory action, the agency said, for labs with a ""repeated failure to correct past observation, biosafety and security concerns"" or failures to comply with extra security requirements for work with ""Tier 1"" select agents. Tier 1 agents are those deemed to pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating economic effects.

While under scrutiny of the program, an individual researcher or project must halt the research that has been found in violation, but other select agent research at the institution generally is allowed to continue, the CDC said.

Thirty-three labs have been put on performance improvement programs since 2008, CDC said. Their names are secret too.

Dozens more labs have faced regulatory actions from the USDA, which takes the lead overseeing select agent labs primarily working with animal or agricultural pathogens. The USDA says it has conducted 48 investigations that have resulted in $116,750 in fines.

The USDA said all of its enforcement records about these fines are required to be kept secret because of the 2002 bioterrorism law. The USDA did release a spreadsheet it says documents its actions, but the agency redacted almost all the information on it: lab names, violation types and even dates. Only a few references to warning letters and fines were spared the agency's black marker.

The Federal Select Agent Program says no law or regulation bars the labs themselves from discussing their select agent research. And universities and other research institutions routinely publish their research on select agent pathogens in scientific journals.

Registered labs just aren't supposed to share details of specific security measures, such as locations of keys and codes, that would give access to pathogens. The CDC and USDA said there is nothing that prohibits labs from releasing information or answering questions about any regulatory problems they've had. Yet few were willing to readilydiscuss violations or failed inspections.

Labs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa are among those in the federal performance improvement program, at least as of January, records obtained by USA TODAY show. Although the secrecy provisions of the 2002 bioterrorism law apply only to certain federal agencies, officials at the state-run university cited that law among its reasons for denying requests for records about safety violations and the performance improvement program.

The university inadvertently confirmed that its Honolulu labs had been put in the performance improvement program in records it filed in January with Hawaii's Office of Information Practices, which is deciding USA TODAY's public records appeal. The university wrote that being put on a PIP is something it is ""proud"" of.

""We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,"" the university wrote to the appeals agency, adding that it ""has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.""

University of Hawaii officials declined to be interviewed.

Last year, two labs agreed to pay fines handed down by the HHS Office of Inspector General for select agent violations, records show.

A lab that federal officials would describe only as an ""Arizona research university"" agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens they worked with. The lab, the USA TODAY Network's reporting found, was Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Lab director Paul Keim said the issues date back to 2010 when the university had difficulty keeping up with changing federal regulations. Since then the university's labs have passed several inspections, he said.

An unnamed Florida laboratory agreed to pay $50,000 to resolve violations that included failing to ensure accurate inventories of select agents and failing to notify the CDC and appropriate law enforcement agencies after discovering a missing select agent.

The inspector general's office, citing regulations stemming from the 2002 bioterrorism law, redacted the names of these labs, as well as all other labs receiving fines, in documents it provided to USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Other labs that have been fined over the years for select agent violations are located in Alabama, California, Missouri, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, records show.

Congress gets limited, wrong information A $425,000 fine that disappeared

As a way of providing some oversight, Congress requires a report each year on the number of thefts, losses and releases of bioterror pathogens at labs regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.

Yet regulators provide scant details of their activities and the problems identified at labs. Usually just three pages long plus a cover page, the reports contain only aggregated counts of lab incidents by type, plus vague information on a few serious incidents.

The select agent program told Congress it had ""imposed a $425,000 civil money penalty"" on an unnamed lab where a serious biosafety lapse in 2008 had resulted in a cow in a nearby disease-free herd becoming infected with Brucella bacteria, which cause brucellosis.

Brucellosis is a contagious and economically significant agricultural disease  which causes cattle and other livestock to abort their fetuses, produce less milk, suffer weight loss, infertility and lameness. It has been the subject of eradication efforts for decades.

The $425,000 fine would have been one of the largest in the overall select agent program's history  if it had actually been imposed.

But it wasn't imposed, USA TODAY's investigation found, and the USDA never corrected the record with Congress.

Despite the risks, researchers at the Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services are committed to their jobs. They are well trained and say that training is the key to safety. (USA NEWS, USA TODAY)

USA TODAY was able to identify the Brucella research program at Louisiana State University's AgCenter in Baton Rouge as the likely recipient of the $425,000 fine by examining USDA animal health reports that tallied what states reported brucellosis cases in 2008. Louisiana, which had a case that year, had been declared brucellosis-free in 2000.

LSU officials spent months denying USA TODAY access to its records about the incident, citing among other things select agent regulations unrelated to the requested information. In statements and interviews, LSU downplayed its violations and provided information that was later contradicted by federal records.

""The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,"" LSU officials said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY.

Yet, in December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the incident investigation reports from the USDA and Louisiana's state agriculture department, the documents showed no uncertainty.

USDA records show that investigators documented serious violations. In levying the $425,000 fine, regulators cited LSU for failing to have adequate biosafety measures, resulting in the release of the bacteria that caused the cow's infection. The USDA also cited LSU for violating regulations by sending Brucella-infected cattle that had been part of select agent vaccine experiments to an unregistered slaughter facility where their meat was sold for human consumption.

LSU's Phil Elzer, who at the time ran the Brucella studies and now is a university administrator, said in an interview the practice of sending research cattle to slaughter was declared in the lab's operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators. ""To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,"" Elzer said. LSU appealed, and the USDA eventually dropped the fine, he said.

In January 2010, records show, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed but reiterating the issues with the infected cow and the use of the unauthorized slaughter plant.

USDA officials acknowledge that they never imposed the $425,000 fine and made a mistake touting it in their report to Congress.

""It should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine,"" said Freeda Isaac, USDA's director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, in an emailed statement. Isaac added that the USDA suspended a portion of LSU's select agent registration because of the Brucella incident and ""that portion of the registration is still suspended,"" Isaac said last fall.

Limitations of self-policing Some researchers ignore biosafety rules

For those labs not in the select agent program  and even those that are  self-policing is the front line of biosafety. Biosafety committees at research institutions, often staffed by scientists' colleagues, assess the risks of proposed research and grant or deny approval for studies. Labs also have other safety staff who may do internal inspections and lab audits, plus additional committees overseeing the use of animals in research.

Yet some researchers appear ignorant of their institutions' biosafety rules. Others brazenly ignore repeated requests by biosafety staff to stop experiments and address issues.

Documents obtained by the USA TODAY Network include at least 50 incidents since 2012 in which researchers were conducting experiments with genetically manipulated organisms without proper approval from internal safety committees. In some cases, records show researchers flaunting their institutional rules.

 At the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in, biosafety staff concluded in a 2013 report that the root causes of a researcher failing to get her experiments approved included ""general indifference of the investigator to institutional rules governing the need for biosafety compliance"" as well as a ""lack of oversight of research activities."" The scientist, the investigation revealed, knowingly launched unapproved experiments  exposing mice to a genetically manipulated strain of Burkholderia thailandensis  in a quest to get a vaccine study manuscript published that reviewers said needed additional data. The research was halted after veterinarians found several cages containing dead and dying mice, yet none of the cages was labeled with the infectious agent and they were in an area not approved for experiments with a BSL-2 pathogen. The incident was ""an extremely unusual event,"" said Sheila Champlin, an assistant vice chancellor at the center, noting corrective actions were taken before the scientist was allowed to resume research.

 At the University of Iowa, a biosafety officer in February 2014 discovered that a scientist had been conducting experiments with a genetically manipulated strain of the MERS virus since September 2013 without biosafety committee approval. The biosafety officer ordered the investigator to stop all experiments, and the scientist was put on probation and received increased safety monitoring. The work was being done in a BSL-3 lab at the time it was discovered, but started in a BSL-2 lab, the safety officer's investigation found. The university concluded that the scientist did not ""effectively communicate"" to his staff the importance of getting safety committee approval before starting the experiments with the virus, which can cause a deadly, contagious respiratory disease in people.

 At the University of California-Irvine, a researcher ignored repeated notices from biosafety staff during 2012 and 2013 that a research project's approval had expired, that it needed further revisions and that all work must cease  yet the scientist continued the experiments with a lentivirus, anyway, in the BSL-2 lab. As a result of the incident, the university now sends researchers four notices starting 90 days before approvals expire, said James Hicks, the university's associate vice chancellor of research. As the deadline nears, Hicks is copied on the notices so he can intervene if necessary. ""We take a very strong view and a very correct view of the importance of following the regulations and the guidelines,"" he said in an interview.

 At the University of Nebraska, a biosafety officer in 2013 found that a researcher had continued growing plants as part of an experiment using a transgenic tobacco rattle virus vector  despite being told repeatedly over two months that additional approval was needed from the biosafety committee before research could begin. As a result of the incident, the university said it revised its biosafety guidelines to describe consequences of unapproved research and sent a letter to faculty. ""This was an isolated instance that was fully and successfully resolved,"" the university said.

 At the University of Hawaii-Manoa, biosafety staff discovered a scientist was doing a type of cancer research in 2012 despite being denied biosafety committee approval and being repeatedly told not to do the experiments. Separately, at a March 2013 biosafety committee meeting at the university, members discussed the need for penalties when researchers fail to comply with biosafety rules, stating ""there must be some consequence and corrective action other than an email"" to the scientist, the minutes say.

Labs that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other federal agencies are required to report incidents to the NIH involving certain types of genetically engineered organisms and recombinant DNA technology. From 2010 through 2014, the NIH received 644 reports of lab incidents during this kind of research.

Most of the reports the NIH receives are for what it says are non-serious incidents, such as small spills, splashes, cuts and equipment failures. Failure to obtain required biosafety committee approvals to do this type of research are among the more common types of non-compliance.

Although it is not a regulatory agency, the NIH said in a statement that agency staff have made site visits to 100 institutions in recent years in an effort to help improve biosafety committee resources and adherence to the NIH Guidelines for operating their labs.

""Most instances of non-compliance result from a lack of full understanding of the requirements of the NIH Guidelines, rather than willful disregard, and our emphasis has been on corrective actions through education, which institutions seem uniformly responsive to,"" the NIH said.

In September 2014, the NIH contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had knowingly failed to report lab incidents as required, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told the NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to the NIH but should have been, the records show.

The records indicate that University of Louisville biosafety officials were aware of some of the unreported incidents as much as six months before the NIH opened its inquiry. William Pierce Jr., the university's executive vice president for research and innovation, in a statement to USA TODAY, said ""there was apparent confusion regarding the authority and responsibility for reporting violations to the NIH."" Pierce said the university has hired an outside firm to oversee its biosafety committee and created training courses for scientists. ""We feel confident the current system is working,"" he said.

The NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency's questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future.

""In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance,"" the NIH said in response to USA TODAY's questions.

For some residents living near labs, the lack of transparency is frustrating  and worrisome. It's not enough to tell the public the labs have robust safety procedures. ""What people are really interested in is how well it's working,"" said Beth Willis, the citizen lab safety representative near Fort Detrick. ""The more people in the community feel that there's secrecy, the more they're distrustful, whether their distrust is warranted or not.""",[]

Newly retired quarterback Peyton Manning opened his news conference Monday with a story about former Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, recalling how he had the honor of meeting Unitas after a game in Baltimore when Manning was a rookie with Indianapolis.

Manning recalled how Unitas told the young quarterback to stick with it, and it was one of many touching moments in Mannings prepared speech. In 2002, following Unitas death, Manning wore a pair of high-top cleats in honor of Unitas.

That gesture, and Mannings goodbye speech, reached Unitas widow, who on Tuesday issued a statement in praise of Manning.

""I was again struck with emotion as Peyton related John's encouraging words following a Colts game against the Ravens in Baltimore. Knowing my husband as I did for more than 32 years, I can assure Peyton that old No. 19 is indeed up there with his flat top and ... his black high tops on and that he is very proud of No. 18, Sandra Unitas wrote. In Manning, John recognized a man of similar character, someone who shared the same love for the game. Though generations apart as Colts quarterbacks, John Unitas was very proud that a young man like Peyton Manning followed in his footsteps.

But heres our best guess at how each American League West team will line up from 1 to 9:

Houston Astros

2B Jose Altuve

RF George Springer

SS Carlos Correa

CF Carlos Gomez

3B Luis Valbuena

LF Colby Rasmus

DH Evan Gattis

1B Jon Singleton

C Jason Castro

The top of the Astros order stacks up favorably with any in the majors, but with so many free swingers, strikeouts will be plentiful for opposing pitchers. If Springer stays healthy, hes a threat for 30 homers and 30 steals. (He did it in the minors.)

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Gomez also lost significant time to injury, but hes close to 100% and still owns the power/speed skills that made him a first-round fantasy pick last spring. Meanwhile, Gattis had hernia surgery last month and might not be ready for opening day. Preston Tucker and Jake Marisnick could get more early-season at-bats as a result.

Singleton has his best chance for regular playing time if he makes consistent contact. If not, top prospect A.J. Reed isnt far away after hitting 34 homers at Class A and AA.

Los Angeles Angels

3B Yunel Escobar

RF Kole Calhoun

CF Mike Trout

1B Albert Pujols

DH C.J. Cron

LF Daniel Nava

C Carlos Perez

2B Johnny Giavotella

SS Andrelton Simmons

Quite possibly the team with the least depth, the Angels will rely heavily on Trout and Pujols to carry their offense. But Pujols, 36, is coming off foot surgery in November.

Free agent signee Escobar fills vacancies at leadoff and third base. Calhoun hit a career-high 26 homers last season, but his rising strikeout rate is a concern.

The biggest question is in left field, where Nava is battling Craig Gentry, minor leaguer Rafael Ortega and waiver pickup Todd Cunningham for at-bats after a proposed deal for the Toronto Blue Jays Michael Saunders fell through.

Oakland Athletics

CF Billy Burns

2B Jed Lowrie

RF Josh Reddick

LF Khris Davis

C Stephen Vogt

3B Danny Valencia

DH Billy Butler

1B Yonder Alonso

SS Marcus Semien

The As are the consensus choice to finish last in the AL West, but dont sell them short. Despite playing at a pitcher-friendly home park, they finished in the middle of the pack in offense last season.

AL East | Central | West

Burns is the catalyst after stealing 26 bases in 125 games. The additions of Lowrie, Davis and Alonso should make the lineup even better. Manager Bob Melvin will look to maximize platoon advantages and leverage the ability of Vogt, Valencia, 2B-OF Chris Coghlan and 1B-OF Mark Canha to play multiple positions. Vogt might not be ready to start the year because of arthroscopic elbow surgery in January.

Seattle Mariners

SS Ketel Marte

3B Kyle Seager

DH Nelson Cruz

2B Robinson Cano

1B Adam Lind

CF Leonys Martin

RF Seth Smith

C Chris Iannetta

LF Nori Aoki

The three major acquisitions on offense  Lind, Martin and Aoki  are left-handed hitters, so this lineup could have trouble when a southpaw is on the mound. Daily fantasy owners know how much Cruz loves to hit against lefties (.357/435/.673 last year), but hell need help from the platoon bats of Jesus Montero, Franklin Gutierrez and possibly Korean import Dae-ho Lee.

Except for a bit more power (21 homers), Canos numbers dropped from his first season in Seattle. After having sports hernia surgery, he should be 100% by opening day.

Texas Rangers

CF Delino DeShields

RF Shin-Soo Choo

1B Prince Fielder

3B Adrian Beltre

DH Mitch Moreland

LF Ian Desmond

2B Rougned Odor

SS Elvis Andrus

C Robinson Chirinos

DeShields was a terrific Rule 5 pickup last season who blossomed into a leadoff man, posting a .344 OBP and stealing 25 bases. Choo rebounded from a horrible start to become one of the majors most productive hitters after the All-Star break.

NL East | Central | West

Josh Hamiltons injury history spurred the Rangers to sign Desmond, who has made one start in the outfield in the majors. Moving from shortstop will help Desmonds value as long as he can rebound offensively.

If things dont work out, the Rangers have exciting outfield prospects Nomar Mazara and Lewis Brinson.",[]

Busts

OF Nelson Cruz, Seattle Mariners

With his 44-homer season, Cruz tries to convince us hell keep defying age. But hell turn 36 in July. And that .350 BABIP from last year doesnt jive, so .302 BA will drop. And hes a long shot for double-digit steals, so hes vulnerable if any of his major skills dip. #Downside.

OF Yoenis Cespedes, New York Mets

.287-17-44 in just 230 AB with Mets following trade. Scorching summer. But that pace wont sustain in a full year. Expect fewer runs and a big batting average drop. Maybe in the fifth round or so, but recency bias could squash any profit opportunity.

READ MORE: 2016 sleepers

1B Albert Pujols, Los Angeles Angels

Recovery from foot surgery jeopardizes the start of his season. Probably will take him time to work into game form. Power will come when he gets right, but when? Though first base is a spotty position, dont automatically reach for name recognition, because this one is for a 36-year-old with a possibly chronic issue.

SS Francisco Lindor, Cleveland Indians

The notion of position scarcity will convince many to believe in Lindors 12-homer run last year. Count on the speed and helpful batting average  though not the inflated .313, which was inflated. But the pop has been a recent upward trend, and last year was too much, too soon, considering more than half of his batted balls rolled on the ground. Top-10 shortstop, not top-five.

Overvalued

C Salvador Perez, Kansas City Royals

Much of his value comes from playing every day. 1. Tony Cruz could steal more of that work. 2. Its tough to trust catchers not to break down. He has a lot of mileage for a 26-year-old. Since last years 20 homers were probably the best well see out of him for the near future, he probably wont have much different numbers than Russell Martin or Travis d'Arnaud. Perez has much less upside than much later picks like Matt Wieters, Yan Gomes, and others.

1B Prince Fielder, Texas Rangers

The power drop is a big concern. Even with his favorable home park, he needs a lot of surprise fortune to climb back toward 30 homers. Though early mockers are saying otherwise, hes not a definite stronger pick than Freddie Freeman or Eric Hosmer.

SP Sonny Gray, Oakland Athletics

Look, his stuff can be suffocating, especially with his high rates of grounders induced. But Gray has struck out just 7.4 per nine in his two full seasons  way below those of other top-20 arms  and those 3.08 and 2.73 ERAs, respectively, look like mirages. If you want this shaky a profile, you could wait a few rounds and take Jordan Zimmermann.

SP Shelby Miller, Arizona Diamondbacks

The breakthrough of his cutter could help him find the ace potential he has flashed, but hell fall short if he cant increase his Ks and overcome his tough home park. That 3.02 ERA last year lacked a strong foundation. As a fourth fantasy starter, hell work. Anything higher? Youre pushing it.

3B Matt Duffy, San Francisco Giants

Hell be a useful player, but an expected 20-ish-points drop in batting average will remove much of his value. His reliance on mild power and speed isnt ideal for a corner infielder.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Focus on teams to boost diversity,"['Est March', 'Aubrey Blanche', 'P M']","Atlassian headquarters in Sydney, Australia (Photo: William West, AFP/Getty Images)

It's no secret there's a serious lack of diversity in the tech industry and the first step in solving a problem is acknowledging it. Many companies now release diversity figures in an effort to be more transparent about the degree to which certain groups are underrepresented. More progressive companies are trying to take that one step further by launching programs aimed at closing those gaps.

But there's a lot of criticism that very little has actually changed since these reports and programs launched. Corporate-level numbers haven't helped us move the needle. Why?

The answer is simple: We're only looking at a small slice of the data. The key to making real change requires us to go deeper. We need to focus on where diversity matters most: teams.

Increased representation isn't always increased diversity

Corporate-level data helps us understand where we are as an industry. It gives us a great sense of the make-up of the tech industry as it stands now, and allows us to compare how companies are doing relative to each other overall.

But it doesn't tell us how to move forward. Nor does it tell us anything about the specific gaps a particular company has. In fact, corporate-level numbers can distract from the fact that an increase in representation doesn't necessarily mean an increase in diversity. That's a critical distinction to make. For example, a company could increase its representation of women of color by two percentage points. But if all of those women are working on the same team, the company is unlikely to get any of the benefits associated with diversity.

And these are not minuscule benefits. Diversity provides companies with important competitive advantages. Research shows the introduction of people who are demographically different within a group drives greater innovation and individual and team performance. In fact, team performance has been shown to increase by 58% with the introduction of a diverse team member. That's why the only way for meaningful business impact to occur is ensuring diversity is represented at the team  not just corporate  level.

Teams are key to driving business benefit

Aubrey Blanche, Atlassian's global head of diversity and inclusion (Photo: Sam Rollier)

At Atlassian, we are all about teams. We know that behind every lone genius, every transformative innovation, is a team working tirelessly to make it happen. And it turns out, teams are key to improving the diversity of our company  even our entire industry. Diversity of thought happens when people with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are given the chance to collaborate. Drilling deeper into diversity data to look at the state of diversity within teams is the only way to discover if people from different backgrounds and identities actually interact. After all, it's this interaction that drives real business benefits.

Team-level diversity data is the only way to get at the meaningful gaps within a company. That, in turn, can help leaders develop actionable programs to address those gaps. If a company sees that most women are grouped together in only a few teams, programs that boost the recruitment of women should focus on teams with lower levels of representation. If people of color tend to be spread across teams, it becomes clear that programs are needed to encourage cross-team communities that foster a sense of belonging and inclusion. Creating specific strategies to improve representation and inclusion at the team level will drive change in corporate-level numbers, in a more transparent way with greater impact.

We need to change the diversity conversation

On Tuesday, we released the industry's first team diversity report to provide an understanding about what Atlassian teams look like. Driven by our deeper understanding, we've made important improvements that helped us hire and retain the most diverse groups of Atlassians yet. But we're not yet where we want to be ((75% male globally, and 73% white, 17% Asian, 5% Latino and 2% black in the United States).

We'll continue analyzing these numbers to design programs that address the specific needs of each of our teams, and sharing our successes and failures with the rest of the industry.

With baseballs spring training in full throttle, USA TODAY Sports examines the four keys to winning the National League pennant for each team. A look at the NL, in alphabetical order:

***

Arizona Diamondbacks

1. Beat the Dodgers: The Diamondbacks had their first winning record against the division since 2012 but finished 6-13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With a retooled pitching staff they need to be able to pull out games against the division front-runners. One advantage is the DBacks raided the Dodgers for Zack Greinke. He beat Arizona twice last season.

2.Use speed: The Dbacks had the second-most stolen bases in the league last season (132) and left the second-fewest runners in scoring position a game in the majors. They lost 21 stolen bases when Ender Inciarte was shipped to the Atlanta Braves, but Arizona retains exceptional speed at the top of their order with A.J. Pollack.

3. Starters eat innings: Greinke will need to be the workhorse as the bullpen had to pitch the most innings in baseball in 2015. Greinke pitched 222 2/3 innings last season for the Dodgers and has pitched more than 200 innings in six of the last eight seasons. Shelby Miller should help. Last season he threw 205 1/3 innings, a career high. Last season the Diamondbacks relied on their lineup to carry the team, but they focused on the starting rotation in this offseason. Bringing in Greinke and Miller should provide the bullpen with some rest and lock down the late-game situations, making Arizona dangerous in the National League West.

4.Tomas breakout year: Yasmany Tomas came from Cuba last year with great acclaim but struggled. He hit nine homers and drove in 48 runs in 118 games. He hit above .300 in April, May and June but fell off after the break. Tomas will start in the outfield and try to prove he was worth the August six-year deal he signed.

Atlanta Braves

1. Develop young talent: The Braves are in full rebuild mode, and the best-case scenario is that their young talent will show potential. Ender Inciarte, Matt Wisler and Arodys Vizcaino have a ton of developing to do this season. The Braves also have six top-100 prospects in their farm system, which will help solidify their future. Dansby Swanson came over from the Arizona Diamondbacks and is a top-10 prospect, but he wont be breaking into the majors anytime soon. Aaron Blair is most likely the next prospect to break through after going 13-5 in the minors last season. He struggles with control, averaging 2.4strikeouts per walk.

2. Veteran leadership: As with any rebuilding team, the success of the Braves depends on veteran leadership. Players such as Nick Markakis, Erick Aybar and A.J. Pierzynski will have the responsibility of not only being role models to the young core, but also carrying the team on the field. Markakis power numbers have slipped, but his batting average jumped by 20 points in 2015. Aybar has been consistent despite his slugging percentage falling for four consecutive seasons. Pierzynski hit .300 last season for the first time since 2009.

3. Pitching on the road: The Braves had a major league-low 25 wins on the road in 2015. Opponents hit .287 with a .476 slugging percentage away from Turner Field.

4. Freeman against lefties: Freddie Freeman will be the star of this team for years, but his inability to hit lefties has hampered his output. He hit .219 last season against southpaws with one home run, compared with 17 home runs and a .298 batting average against right-handers. Freeman always has had trouble against lefties, but 2015 was by far his worst season.

Chicago Cubs

1. Keep ace fresh: Including the postseason, Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta threw a career-high 248 2/3 innings in 2015, a nearly 100-inning jump from the career-high 156 2/3 he tossed in 2014, a staggering increase. You have to wonder if fatigue might play a role in Arrietas 2016 season. Fortunately, the Cubs have Travis Wood and Clayton Richard available for spot starts to give him rest.

2. Outfield defense: In left, Kyle Schwarber could improve with some more time under his belt, but he had a tough time in 2015, including some major gaffes in the National League Championship Series. Jorge Soler has a great arm, but his defensive metrics are poor, making him a liability in the field. The surprising return of Dexter Fowler helps what could have been a real mess in Chicago, as Fowler resumes his role in center, where he had four errors last season. New acquisition and three-time Gold Glover Jason Heyward can play right.

3. Cut down on strikeouts: The offense led the majors with 1,518 strikeouts in 2015, 126 more than the second-worst team. Kris Bryant whiffed 199 times, Addison Russell had 149 strikeouts in 475 at-bats and Soler went down 121 times in 101 games. The overall figure should improve with the addition of contact hitter Ben Zobrist (career 5.70 AB/K), but this is an organizational issue that needs to be addressed.

4. The kids cant regress: Bryant was NL rookie of the year in 2015, but the Cubs favorite status heading into the season is based on the assumption that Bryant, Schwarber, Russell and Soler will be able to improve upon last year. If any of the three struggle, the Cubs might find themselves in a precarious position as the season wears on.

Cincinnati Reds

1. Development of young pitchers: After dealing veterans Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake at the trade deadline, the Reds had a rookie pitcher start each of their final 64 games. That experience should help this years starting five, and Homer Bailey could return from elbow surgery in May. Anthony DeSclafani and Raisel Iglesias showed occasional flashes of brilliance. Iglesias improved as the season progressed. In 11 starts after the All-Star break, the Cuban struck out 10.4 batters per nine innings. Brandon Finnegan and John Lamb (back surgery) should be in the rotation as well.

2. Lineup protection for Joey Votto: The Reds offense struggled last season, but Votto hit. 314 with 29 homers and a .459 on-base percentage. His exceptional plate discipline could be tested even more in 2016 with power-hitting third baseman Todd Frazier no longer hitting behind him. If pitchers decide to throw Votto even fewer strikes, Brandon Phillips and Jay Bruce must make them pay.

3. Full seasons from Devin Mesoraco and Zack Cozart: Mesoraco, who led NL catchers in 2014 with 25 home runs, never fully recovered from a hip injury and had 45 at-bats. Cozart was having the best season of his career when he suffered a season-ending knee injury in June. Both expect to be ready for opening day.

4. Billy Hamilton becoming an effective leadoff man: Perhaps the fastest player in the majors, Hamilton struggled to get on base last season, posting an anemic .274 OBP. He had offseason shoulder surgery and was cleared to resume swinging a bat in December. Manager Bryan Price has indicated Hamilton will open the season in the leadoff spot, but hell need to be more of an asset than a liability to stay there.

Colorado Rockies

1. Find some pitching: The Rockies had the worst ERA, most walks allowed and fourth-fewest strikeouts in the majors last season. The Rockies are going to have to work with a below-average rotation that lacks a star and gave up an NL-high 533 runs. However, Colorado made a strong move to address their late-inning needs by signing veteran free agents Jason Motte and Chad Qualls and acquiring Jake McGee from the Tampa Bay Rays this offseason, all closers at times in their careers.

2. Hit away from Coors: At home their average was .302 and they hit 102 home runs. On the road they hit .228 with 84 round-trippers. Even in his breakout year, Nolan Arenado was mediocre on the road. He led the Rockies last year for the entire season, but when he left Denver he hit only .258. Coors Field is traditionally a hitters park, but if the Rockies can hit only in Denver, there is no way their pitching can carry them on the road.

3. Shortstop: Jose Reyes was arrested and charged and his wife sought medical treatment after an incident at a Maui resort Oct. 31. Commissioner Rob Manfred will wait until Reyes legal issues are resolved before making a ruling on a suspension, with criminal proceedings scheduled for April 4 in Hawaii. Top prospect Trevor Story, who played in Class AAA last season, is competing with Cristhian Adames and Daniel Descalso for time at shortstop to start the season.

4. Pray for prospects: Story is next up in the infield for the Rockies, but starter Jon Gray hasnt figured out how to pitch at Coors Field. Jeff Hoffman and Kyle Freeland are the next big pitching prospects and could arrive at some point in 2016.

New Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has to deal with concerns about the rotation. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)

Los Angeles Dodgers

1. Strength in rotation behind Kershaw: The Dodgers have a surefire ace in Clayton Kershaw, but behind him are a bunch of question marks. They brought in Scott Kazmir from the Houston Astros, but he is inconsistent. He also has only pitched 200 innings in a season once. They bought back Brett Anderson, but he is lost for 3-5 months to back surgery. The question now is who will replace him. Kershaw is the only guy who has proved he can go deep into games, so the Dodgers need to find a solid No. 2 starter.

2. How much does Kendrick have left? Howie Kendrick has been a stalwart at second base for the last six years, but at 32 you wonder how much he has in the tank. His backup is Chase Utley, who is most likely in the final year of his career. Kendrick played in 117 games last season, his lowest total since 2009, and missed significant time with injury. Kendrick just signed a two-year deal with the Dodgers, and as long as he can stay healthy, that price tag will pay off.

3. Win away from LA: The Dodgers were tied for the best home record in baseball last year at 55-26, but they struggled on the road, including 2-8 in San Francisco. The Arizona Diamondbacks strengthened their biggest weakness, pitching, so the NL West is now a three-team race. The Dodgers wont be able to ride their strong home performance as much this year.

4. How does Roberts handle spotlight? Dave Roberts has very little managerial experience and faces a high-pressure job in L.A. He will have to deal with some personalities, including Yasiel Puig, who has clashed with managers and teammates. Roberts must acclimate himself to the bright spotlight quickly.

Miami Marlins

1. Stantons health: Giancarlo Stanton is among the games best young sluggers but needs to stay healthy. Stanton has played 150 games only once in his career. Last year, he was limited to 74 games because of a wrist injury that required surgery. He hit 27home runs despite playing less than half of the season. He hit nine homers in May and 12 in June before going down. Through those 74 games he homered every 10 at-bats, best in the majors.

2. Strong start from their core: Christian Yelich was hitting .220 through May 31 last year, and Jose Fernandez hadnt begun pitching by the end of May. Fernandez came back from his injury with better control and didnt miss a step from before his surgery. By the time Yelich was hitting and Fernandez was dealing again, the Marlins had already lost more than two months of the season. This year the core of Yelich, Fernandez and Stanton will be healthy, and the Marlins need to use that to make a statement.

3. No. 2 pitcher: Fernandez is a clear ace, but they dont have an obvious No. 2. Wei-Yin Chen has the task of eating innings and proving the Marlins were right to bring him in from the Baltimore Orioles to be their No. 2 guy. The four-year starter threw 1911/3 innings last year but has never surpassed 200. Chen is known for his consistency, not big numbers.

4. Win road games: The Marlins were over .500 at home the last two seasons but have been terrible on the road. They havent had a winning road record since 2009, which is amazing because the Marlins dont have such a great home-field advantage in terms of fan base. They had the third-lowest attendance in the majors last season despite a 3-year-old ballpark.

USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale predicts some things you'd never expect. USA TODAY Sports

Milwaukee Brewers

1. A healthy Ryan Braun: The 2011 National League MVP has struggled with various ailments the last few seasons. Though productive (.285, 25 HRs, 84 RBI, 24 stolen bases in 2015), he hasnt been as dominant as in the past. Last offseason, Braun was returning from thumb surgery. This offseason, back surgery has him slightly behind schedule.

2. The youngsters grow up quickly: A few years ago, the Brewers had one of the worst farm systems in the majors. But solid drafting and several veterans-for-prospects trades have fortified the organization. Outfielder Domingo Santana, 23, acquired from Houston in the Carlos Gomez trade, is slated to be the opening-day right fielder. The pitching staff got a boost last season from rookie Taylor Jungmann (9-8, 3.77 ERA), who could be joined in the rotation by Zach Davies, Jorge Lopez or Josh Hader  all 23 or younger. And top prospect Orlando Arcia, 21, likely will start the season in the minors but could easily be starting at shortstop by midseason.

3. Jimmy Nelson becomes a true No. 1 starter: The right-hander led the team with 30 starts and 177 1/3 innings, posting a respectable 11-13 record and 4.11 ERA. His extreme ground-ball tendencies play well in homer-friendly Miller Park. An improved walk rate is his key to becoming the staff ace.

4. The relievers continue to shine: The bullpen was one of five to average more than a strikeout per inning. The big question is who will close. Lefty Will Smith (7-2, 2.70 ERA, 12.9 strikeouts per nine innings) is the most accomplished. Corey Knebel is the youngest at 24, and Jeremy Jeffress throws the hardest (95.4 mph average fastball velocity). Any could end up closing.

New York Mets

1. Health of rotation: Matt Harvey is a year removed from Tommy John elbow surgery, and Zack Wheeler is slowly making his way back from the same surgery. Bartolo Colon will be 43, and while he hasnt slowed much, age will eventually catch up to him. The Mets rode great young pitching to the playoffs last season, but if Harvey reinjures himself or Jacob deGrom is overworked early, it could spell big trouble.

2. Big shoes to fill: Daniel Murphy lit the fire late in the season that sent the Mets into the playoffs, and now Murphy is playing for the division rival Washington Nationals. Neil Walker comes in from the Pittsburgh Pirates with a huge spot to fill. On the surface Walker and Murphy look similar. Both second basemen can hit .270 and pack pop, but Walker has more power, having hit 69home runs since 2012 compared with Murphys 42. Walker also is a better fielder, but he struck out 110times last season; Murphy whiffed 38 times.

3. Lean on their bats: Last season the Mets won their division because of pitching, but their weakness was on display when they couldnt keep up with the Kansas City Royals in the World Series. They were tied for the second-worst batting average in the majors last season at .244. This year, while their rotation will be their strength, the Mets need Curtis Granderson, David Wright, Yoenis Cespedes and Lucas Duda to carry the lineup if they want to beat out the Nationals and Chicago Cubs in the NL.

4. Meet expectations: The Mets are finally back at the top of their division, but historically that has not guaranteed sustained success. If the Mets can break the cycle and finally meet and exceed expectations, maybe they can bring home a World Series ring.

Philadelphia Phillies

1. Continued youth improvement: Though the Phillies went 63-99 for the worst record in baseball last season, three players established themselves as potential foundation pieces for the rebuilding franchise. RH Aaron Nola does not have overpowering stuff but possesses the smarts and competitiveness to pitch at the top of the rotation. Maikel Franco flashed the kind of power that had some comparing him to Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt. CF Odubel Herrera showed flashes of brilliance after being selected from the Texas Rangers in the Rule 5 draft, then being converted from 2B.

2. A boost from more youngsters: RH Vincent Velasquez is 23 and impressed with his live arm early in spring training after being acquired in the trade that sent closer Ken Giles to the Houston Astros. 2B Cesar Hernandez, LF Aaron Altherr and RH Jerad Eickhoff are all 25, and the Phillies think each can be significant contributors. The organization has a number of top prospects at the upper levels of the farm system who could help later in the season.

3. Stability from veteran starters: The Phillies traded for a pair of right-handers in the offseason, acquiring Jeremy Hellickson from the Arizona Diamondbacks and Charlie Morton from the Pittsburgh Pirates. The hope is they can stabilize the rotation and take stress off the arms of the younger pitchers by eating a fair amount of innings.

4. No distractions: C Carlos Ruiz and 1B Ryan Howard are the lone holdovers from five NL East title teams. Ruiz, 37, and Howard, 36, dont fit on a roster in the middle of a youth movement, but no one is interested in trading for either. The Phillies hope neither becomes a distraction.

Pittsburgh Pirates

1. Complete recovery for Kang: IF Jung Ho Kangs transition as the first South Korean native position player to come to the majors from the Korean Baseball Organization couldnt have gone better last season as he finished third in the NL rookie of the year voting. However, he broke his left leg and tore knee ligaments in September during a collision and might not be ready to start the season. The Pirates are counting on him as the regular third baseman because Josh Harrison will shift to second base with the trade of Neil Walker to the Mets.

2. Jaso channels Hatteberg: One of the main themes in the book Moneyball was the Oakland As signing C Scott Hatteberg because of high on-base percentage and converting him into a first baseman. Its basically an updated version of the story with John Jaso, who was signed to a two-year, $8 million contract as a free agent despite having played five innings at first base in his seven-year career. The Pirates are hoping a platoon of left-handed hitting Jaso and Michael Morse will offset the loss of Pedro Alvarez, who was not tendered a contract.

3. Outfield of dreams: Many consider the Pirates outfield of LF Starling Marte, CF Andrew McCutchen and RF Gregory Polanco as the majors best. McCutchen is a superstar, Marte is on the brink and Polanco has the talent to reach that level.

4. A bullish bullpen: The Pirates have consistently had good-to-outstanding bullpens since Neal Huntington took over as GM late in the 2007 season. Closer Mark Melancon and LH set-up reliever Tony Watson are an outstanding late-inning duo and the Pirates have other appealing options in the middle innings.

John Perrotto

San Diego Padres

1.Bounce back: The team is riddled with stars who had down years in 2015. Matt Kemp still managed to drive in 100 runs, but his average dropped more than 20 points. Wil Myers missed a good chunk of the season after surgery to remove a bone spur and has not had a full season since his 2013 rookie of the year campaign. James Shields, typically a workhorse, threw 202 1/3 innings but struggled with his control much of the time. That inning total was his lowest since his rookie year in 2006. If Kemp, Myers and Shields can return to form this year, it will bode well for the Padres chances.

2.Farm system: The Padres need to make sure they preserve their farm system. Of their projected 25 active players, 22 were signed as a free agent or traded for. Their farm system has taken a hit in recent years, and if they want to be successful, they need to save their prospects. The Padres have three top-100 prospects, and their No. 1, Manuel Margot, could earn a late season call-up if he can produce in Class AA.

3. Get on base: The Padres biggest struggle last year was that they couldnt get base runners. They had the worst on-base percentage in the league at .300. Their 426 walks were fifth worst in the NL, and their 1,324 hits were the fewest in the majors. While a good portion of this lack of production could be attributed to down years from their veterans, the Padres must reverse this trend in 2016.

4. Rodney consistency: Fernando Rodney pitched 54 games for the Seattle Mariners last year but blew seven save chances and had a 5.68 ERA. Once he went to the Chicago Cubs, he only gave up four runs in 14 games. In 2014 he blew three saves, down from eight in 2013. At 39, Rodney must remain in top form in order to win.

St. Louis Cardinals

1. Good health: The Cardinals were slammed by injuries last year yet won 100 games and their third NL Central title in a row while ace RH Adam Wainwright, 1B Matt Adams, LF Matt Holliday and CF Randal Grichuk spent long stints on the disabled list. C Yadier Molina had two offseason surgeries for a torn left thumb ligament, but the seven-time All-Star is hopeful of being ready by opening day. Veteran C Brayan Pena was signed to a two-year, $5 million deal as insurance. But, it didn't take long for them to be hit with their first major injury of 2016. Shortstop Jhonny Peralta is expected to miss 2-3 months with an injured thumb.

2. Replacing Heyward and Lackey: RF Jason Heyward and RH John Lackey were lost to the Cubs in free agency, causing many analysts to predict Chicago will unseat the Cards as division champs. RH Mike Leake was signed to a five-year, $80 million free agent deal to take Lackeys spot and is familiar with the NL Central after spending his first 512 seasons with Cincinnati. The Cardinals will go with Stephen Piscotty, who impressed as a rookie last season, to replace Heyward.

3. Moss homer total grows fat: The Cards decided to bring Brandon Moss back on a one-year, $8.25 million contract. Moss, who was acquired from Cleveland last July, intrigues the Cardinals with his power, as he has averaged more than 23 HRs the last four seasons. They also think he will benefit from being another year removed from hip surgery. The Cardinals have plenty of depth at the position with Adams and Piscotty.

4. Gyorko super sub: IF Jedd Gyorko was acquired from San Diego in a trade, and the Cardinals hope he can provide right-handed pop off the bench. Gyorko hit 49 HRs in his first three seasons, including 23 as rookie in 2013. Manager Mike Matheny also plans to use Gyorko to give regular infielders rest.

San Francisco Giants

1. Get consistency behind the aces: You know what to expect from Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto, but there are a number of ifs behind them. Jeff Samardzija signed for $90 million but needs to bounce back from a 4.96 ERA in his contract year. Jake Peavy pitched well after missing the first half of the season, Matt Cain says hes healthy after two injury-ravaged years and Chris Heston had a respectable 2015 as an older rookie. If a couple of these starters have solid years, the rotation could be one of MLBs best. If not, they might be in trouble.

2. Pence must stay healthy: After seven years in a row playing at least 154 games, RF Hunter Pence had three stints on the disabled list in 2015, limiting him to 52 games. The Giants lack a big-time power hitter, but Pence changes the dynamic of the lineup, batting behind high-on-base percentage guys such as Joe Panik, Buster Posey and Brandon Belt.

3. Sort out center field: Gregor Blanco had a fine 2015, posting a .781 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 327 at-bats, but Angel Pagan, 34, is the incumbent, despite a shaky season in the field. New addition Denard Span is probably the best of the bunch and has the quickness required to man center in spacious AT&T Park. Pagan will likely end up in left, which should save plenty of runs.

4. Get a repeat performance from the bullpen: Five relievers  Santiago Casilla, George Kontos, Sergio Romo, Hunter Strickland and Javier Lopez  pitched at least 55 games with a sub-3.00 ERA in 2015. The bullpen held hitters to a .292 OBP and Lopez was MLBs best lefty specialist, holding left-handed hitters to a .112 average.

Washington Nationals

1. Back end of rotation: The Nationals lost two-fifths of their rotation to free agency. While Doug Fister (forearm injury) had a down year in 2015, he went 16-6 with a 2.41 ERA as the Nationals ran away with the NL East in 2014. Jordan Zimmermann was 46-24 with a 3.19 ERA over the last three seasons. Likely replacements Tanner Roark and Joe Ross have a combined 61 big-league starts. They have an ace pitching coach, Mike Maddux, to counsel them.

2. Lineup balance: The Nationals were 60-63 against right-handed starting pitchers last season. Adding some left-handed bats (Daniel Murphy, Ben Revere, reserve Stephen Drew) to a right-handed heavy lineup should ease the pressure on Bryce Harper to carry the team. Murphy and Revere had the second- and fourth-best contact rates, respectively, in the majors last season, and Murphy slugged .483 against right-handers.

3. New shortstop: The Nationals lost a productive bat when Ian Desmond left but might get a defensive upgrade if Trea Turner eventually wrests the job from Danny Espinosa. Espinosa should win it out of spring training, but 2014 first-rounder Turner could have it at some point in 2016. He offers more upside with the ability to hit for average, get on base and capitalize on his speed.

4. Different feel: The exits of Zimmermann, Fister, speedy center fielder-leadoff man Denard Span, Desmond, reliever Drew Storen and manager Matt Williams shake up the core. But Dusty Baker is a proven winner and players manager who can ease the pressure on a team thats in a rut come October (and September last year). Adding relievers Shawn Kelley, Trevor Gott and Oliver Perez could make them tougher late in games.

This year, Lufthansa is scheduled to roll out its touchless bag drop system at its hub airports in Germany and it has already enhanced its app to include a mobile lost and found, which would automatically alert passengers if their bags had been lost or flown to the wrong airport. Now, the Cologne-based carrier hopes to digitally simplify another aspect of air travel, by launching a site that will automatically check you in for a flight  even flights that aren't on Lufthansa.

Tnooz reports that Lufthansa Innovation Hub, the tech and digital development division of the airline, has designed AirlineCheckins.com, a free service that allows users to check in online for flights on more than 100 airlines around the world. Lufthansa has not specified which airlines are working with the site, although it says the participants are ""large and medium sized airlines.""

How does it work? When a traveler registers for the site and enters all of their flight confirmation and booking details, AirlineCheckins automatically checks them in for their flights as soon as the check-in period for that particular airline opens, usually between 24 and 72 hours before departure. ""In concrete terms, that means that as soon as the airline opens check-in for your upcoming flight, we'll check you in as soon as possible,"" AirlineCheckins explains on its lengthy FAQ page, ""Usually in the very first minute.""

In addition, frequent travelers can store their passport details on the site so that it can complete the check in process for international flights. Passengers can also designate seating preferences, so that the site's service team can snag, say, that left-side exit row aisle seat you love  or whatever available seat most closely matches your wish list.

That's a welcome service, especially if the check-in window for your flight opens in the middle of the night  or at stupid o'clock in the morning. It also means that travelers can spend their time thinking about more pleasant things, like that one time they had enough leg room.

But this is March, and the single-elimination tournaments for automatic bids often reduce four month of success to disappointment in 40 minutes.

Thats where Monmouth is right now, and come Sunday, the Monmouth Hawks wont be the loose bunch that we saw choreograph epic bench celebrations. Theyll be nervously sitting at the edge of their seats watching the selection show.

Bubble teams across American just a brand new dose of anxiety. Monmouth's situation will make earning an at-large bid that much harder.  Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) March 8, 2016

The Hawks are squarely on the bubble, and according to USA TODAYs bubble tracker, Monmouth is among the Last Four In with UConn, Wichita State and Tulsa.

But as conference tournaments roll on, Monmouth could find itself on the outside looking in if a Power 5 underdog steals an at-large bid from the tournaments.

Their tourney dreams are solely in the hands of the committee.

There still is hope for the Hawks. Yes, the bench mob got all of the attention because, well, theyre awesome, but Monmouth played a challenging non-conference schedule. Seventeen of Monmouths 27 wins came in true road games. According to kenpom.com, the Hawks played the 20th-ranked non-conference schedule, which included wins over UCLA, USC, Notre Dame and Georgetown.

The MAAC is a weak conference, but Monmouth did all that it could to make a case for an at-large bid.

The committee has to see what Monmouth did outside of its conference schedule and realize that this team isnt just show  its a team that deserves to be in the Dance. The committee often favors Power 5 programs in bubble situations, but its just tough to justify putting a Florida or Syracuse over a Monmouth team who did everything it could over a four-month span to deserve a spot.

Forty minutes shouldnt change that.

Dearest committee, know youre watching. Give me Monmouth, Wichita State, San Diego State, Valpo. etc., over Syracuse/Pitt in the field.  Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) March 9, 2016

Syracuse, for example, played two road games in its non-conference schedule (at Georgetown and St. Johns) and lost them both. The Orange lost to Pitt in the second round of the ACC Tournament on Wednesday. There just isnt a Power 5 bubble team that makes a better case than the Monmouth.

If the NCAA wants to give fans a March Madness to remember, it needs to give Monmouth a bid.

The team deserves it. Fans deserve it.",[]

While discussing Miesha Tates five-round submission victory over Holly Holm, White said he feels sorry for Holm and that her manager didnt know what he was doing when he booked the fight, according to ESPNs Brett Okamoto.

White said:

The sad part about that is, listen, hes an old boxing guy who thinks hes smart, and hes not, White said during an appearance on ESPNs Russillo & Kanell. Its one of those things. I feel bad about it. I feel bad for Holly. I dont know if Holly really knows what she lost. I think she has so much faith in the people that surround her, she feels like, Well, they got me this far. We had this meeting, and Holly wasnt even in it. Holly, thats your life. You should be in that meeting. Dont leave it to these people. Anyway, Holly made a lot of money. She accomplished great things, she beat Ronda Rousey. But it could have been so much bigger for her, and the sad part is, I dont think she even knows it.

""I feel bad for Holly because I don't know if (she) knows what she lost.""  @danawhite thinks she should have waited for a Rousey rematch  Russillo and Kanell (@RussilloKanell) March 8, 2016

Okamoto reported that ESPN then reached out to Holms manager, Lenny Fresquez, who said that Holm made the ultimate decision and acknowledged that Tate had a solid fight. Fresquez added that right now Holm wants to fight both Tate and Ronda Rousey as soon as possible, but he said that a Holm vs. Rousey matchup would have more glamour.

However, what Fresquez wants most likely will not happen. White already told SportsCenter who he believes will face-off in the next bantamweight championship fight, per MMA Junkie:

I think that Ronda now will fight Miesha Tate for the title, White told ESPNs SportsCenter after UFC 196. Thats whats going to happen. Thats what I said before this fight even happened.

Tate would enjoy it. Shes been waiting for her shot.",[]

(Photo: Royal Caribbean International)

KEY WEST, Fla. -- The Coast Guard on Sunday evening suspended the search for a Texas man who reportedly fell from a cruise ship 40 miles off the Florida coast.

Coast Guard officials said they halted their search for David Mossman, 46, following an ""exhaustive"" effort that covered 2,583 square nautical miles with helicopters, ships and airplanes.

Mossman fell approximately 100 feet to the water from Royal Caribbean's Navigator of the Seas about 11 p.m. Friday, 40 miles south of Key Largo's Carysfort Reef Light, the crew told the Coast Guard early Saturday. A Coast Guard Cutter Gannet, an Air Station Miami MH-65 helicopter and a HC-144 plane were employed to look for Mossman.

""We want to extend our condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Mossman as the decision to suspend a search is never an easy one to make and is done with great care and deliberation,"" said Chris Eddy, search-and-rescue technical specialist at the Coast Guard 7th District. ""Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and an exhaustive search, our crews were unable to locate him.""

Experts said the 100-foot fall likely would have stunned or killed Mossman; if he survived the drop, his chances of remaining alive in the 65-degree water for more than a few hours were slim.

Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the search.

The company has had other struggles recently. Its Anthem of the Seas ship was battered by a major Atlantic storm a month ago, forcing the captain to confine passengers to their cabins overnight in the face of extreme wind and sea conditions."" Last week, the Anthem was hit by a norovirus outbreak.

The Navigator of the Seas holds a maximum of more than 3,800 passengers and more than 1,200 crew members. Its website boasts that was the first ship to debut ""virtual balconies"" that provide the ""sights and sounds of the sea with expansive real-time views of the ocean and our exciting destinations ... from the comforts of your interior stateroom.""

But heres our best guess at how each American League Central team will line up from 1 to 9:

Chicago White Sox

RF Adam Eaton

2B Brett Lawrie

1B Jose Abreu

3B Todd Frazier

LF Melky Cabrera

DH Adam LaRoche

CF Austin Jackson

C Dioner Navarro

SS Jimmy Rollins

After finishing last in scoring and slugging percentage, the Sox added pop in the offseason with Lawrie and All-Star Home Run Derby champion Frazier. Dont be too concerned about Fraziers poor second half in 2015; he has a solid track record, and a more talented supporting cast should keep him from trying to do too much.

The surprise signing of Jackson relegates Avisail Garcia to a part-time role  or a full-time role in the minors.

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Eaton finished in the ALs top 10 in runs scored. Rollins, 37, was signed to a minor league deal but should be able to hold off Tyler Saladino for the majority of playing time. Both are keeping the spot warm until top prospect Tim Anderson is ready.

The White Sox revamped their catching duo this offseason. While Alex Avila might see more playing time, Navarro should give fantasy owners more bang for their buck.

Cleveland Indians

SS Francisco Lindor

DH Carlos Santana

2B Jason Kipnis

1B Mike Napoli

RF Lonnie Chisenhall

C Yan Gomes

LF Will Venable

3B Juan Uribe

CF Rajai Davis

The Indians will start the season at considerably less than full strength on offense. Left fielder Michael Brantley, a complete hitter, is recovering from shoulder surgery. He hopes to be ready by mid-April. Abraham Almonte, the projected starter in center, must serve an 80-game suspension.

Manager Terry Francona has mentioned Santana possibly leading off, but as the teams top home run hitter last season with 19, its more likely hell end up in the middle of the lineup when Brantley returns.

A lot seems to be riding on a bounce-back season from Napoli, 34, whos coming off career lows in batting average (.224) and slugging percentage (.410).

Detroit Tigers

2B Ian Kinsler

LF Justin Upton

1B Miguel Cabrera

DH Victor Martinez

RF J.D. Martinez

3B Nick Castellanos

C James McCann

SS Jose Iglesias

CF Anthony Gose

An excellent contact hitter, Kinsler continues to thrive in the leadoff spot, even at 33. Hell score plenty of runs atop this potent lineup. Upton lands in an almost perfect spot, hitting in front of Cabrera and the Martinezes. This could finally be the season he surpasses the high expectations fantasy owners have for him.

AL East | Central | West

Coming off an injury-plagued 2015, Victor Martinez had a hot start this spring with home runs in each of his first two games. It looks like his knee is much healthier.

On the down side, starting center fielder Cameron Maybin will miss at least a month with a small fracture in his wrist. Gose is a decent speed source but doesnt contribute much else on offense. John Mayberry and Tyler Collins are possibilities.

Kansas City Royals

SS Alcides Escobar

3B Mike Moustakas

CF Lorenzo Cain

1B Eric Hosmer

DH Kendrys Morales

LF Alex Gordon

C Salvador Perez

RF Paulo Orlando

2B Omar Infante

A contact-heavy lineup continues to defy advanced metrics, with Escobars sub-.300 on-base percentage at the top. The Royals were 14th in the league in home runs a year ago but sixth in runs scored.

Breakout seasons for Moustakas and Cain, plus a stunning rebound from Morales, were the keys to success. Fantasy owners would be thrilled if they could repeat their 2015 numbers.

Gordon returns after tepidly testing free agency. Despite missing more than 50 games with a groin injury, he posted a career-high .377 OBP. What if manager Ned Yost hit him leadoff?

Projected starter Jarrod Dyson will miss six weeks with a strained abdominal muscle. Orlando and possibly non-roster invitee Travis Snider will fill the void in right.

Minnesota Twins

2B Brian Dozier

LF Eddie Rosario

1B Joe Mauer

RF Miguel Sano

3B Trevor Plouffe

DH Byung Ho Park

SS Eduardo Escobar

C Kurt Suzuki

CF Byron Buxton

Just who is Brian Dozier? He had 19 home runs and 50 RBI by the All-Star break but hit .210 with nine homers and 27 RBI in the second half. Even worse, he had only three stolen bases after the break. Yet he managed to score more than 100 runs for the second consecutive season.

NL East | Central | West

Sano looked like a future home run champ, hitting 18 in 80 games. His average of one homer every 15.5 at-bats would have ranked him in the top 15 if he had enough plate appearances to qualify. However, theres no way he can duplicate his .401 average on balls in play. Speaking of power bats, Park topped 50 homers in each of the last two seasons in Korea.

The Twins would love to see rookie of the year candidate Buxton blossom to be their leadoff hitter for the next decade, but after he hit .209 in 129 at-bats last season, he still has to prove he belongs in the majors.",[]

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Sharapova guilty of 'willful negligence' in drug test,"['Est March', 'P M']","(Photo: The Associated Press)

LONDON (AP)  Maria Sharapova was guilty of ""willful negligence"" for using meldonium, and international tennis officials were aware that many players were taking the drug before it was banned this year, former World Anti-Doping Agency president Dick Pound said Wednesday.

Pound told The Associated Press that Sharapova could face a ban of up to four years unless she can prove mitigating circumstances to explain her positive test for meldonium at the Australian Open in January.

Meldonium, a Latvian-manufactured drug designed to treat heart conditions, was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list on Jan. 1 after authorities noticed widespread use of the substance among athletes.

In announcing her positive test at a news conference in Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been using the drug for 10 years for various medical issues. The five-time Grand Slam champion and world's highest-earning female athlete said she hadn't realized meldonium had been prohibited this year, taking full responsibility for her mistake.

""An athlete at that level has to know that there will be tests, has to know that whatever she or he is taking is not on the list, and it was willful negligence to miss that,"" Pound said. ""She was warned in advance I gather. The WADA publication is out there. She didn't pay any attention to it. The tennis association issued several warnings, none of which she apparently read.""

""I am sorry, if you are running a $30 million a year sole enterprise you better make sure the basis for that commercial success, if nothing else, remains unassailable,"" Pound added in the interview with the AP on the sidelines of the Tackling Doping in Sport conference at Twickenham Stadium.

Current WADA president Craig Reedie questioned why Sharapova was prescribed meldonium.

""If the reports are true and this was happening when she was a teenager, then you begin to wonder why a drug that is basically to help heart problems was administered,"" he said.

Pound disclosed that international tennis officials had flagged up the use of meldonium to the WADA committee that monitors the use of various drugs and recommends whether to put them on the banned list.

""Clearly, within the tennis circle at least, they were aware that a lot of the players were using it (meldonium) and said that there must be something to this, so they referred it to the WADA list committee,"" Pound said.

So far, Sharapova is the only tennis player with a known positive test for meldonium.

Meldonium, which is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was banned by WADA because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance. Several other athletes in various international sports have already been caught using it since it was banned Jan. 1.

A study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that up to 490 athletes may have been taking meldonium during last year's inaugural European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. The drug was not banned at that time.

The study found that 13 winners or medalists were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and the drug was detected in athletes in 15 of the 21 sports on the program. The research contributed to WADA's decision to add meldonium to the banned list.

Sharapova is being provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation, which will hold hearings on the case and decide on any long-term ban.

""She faces up to four years sanction for this,"" Pound said. ""There will have to be a review of whatever mitigating factors there may be, and not many leap to mind.""

Pound said he did not understand why Sharapova would have been taking the drug for so long.

The player said Monday that she had taken meldonium for a decade following various health problems including regular sicknesses, early signs of diabetes and ""irregular"" results from echocardiography exams.

""Looking at it from 10,000 feet and from outside, you say, 'I am sorry but that doesn't hold together,'"" Pound said. ""You're in the United States, this is a product that is not available in the United States, and so there has got to be more to this than meets the eye.""

Grindeks, the Latvian company that manufactures meldonium, said the normal course of treatment with meldonium is four to six weeks.

""One of the issues that will have to be dealt with is that the use of this product for therapeutic purposes is not a long term,"" Pound said. ""You use it for a single intervention for weeks or months maybe, but not for 10 years in a row.""

Sharapova's lawyer, John J. Haggerty, said Tuesday that he wanted ""to disabuse the concept that Maria took mildronate every day for 10 years because that's simply not the case.""

How do I know? Just look at what the Houston Texas did on Wednesday. They reportedly spent $72 million over four years  with $37 million of that guaranteed  on Brock Osweiler, the now-former Broncos quarterback with seven starts in a four-year career.

Im no general manager, but that seems like an awful lot of money to pour into a small sample size, one that the Broncos seemed just fine with letting go.

But thats the state of the NFL today. In the same month we watched Peyton Manning ride off into the sunset, weve talked about how the Eagles overpaid Sam Bradford, why the Broncos now need Colin Kaepernick and how the Jets would be nuts to let Ryan Fitzpatrick walk. Thats the same 33-year-old who may sign with his seventh NFL team this month. Thats right  a journeyman coming off his best year is now one of the leagues hottest commodities.

If you havent realized it already, theres just not enough talent to go around, so of course NFL franchises are more than happy to overpay for mediocrity.

Look ahead to next season and, suddenly, things seem grim under center. There are arguably only four big stars (Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers and Andrew Luck). Then theres the next tier filled with talented-but-rapidly-aging names (including Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees and Carson Palmer) and quarterbacks like Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Derek Carr and Blake Bortles who you hope will take the next step forward.

Then? It feels like its pretty much everybody else, a list too long to write, filled with flawed or inexperienced QBs.

What does that mean? It could be another year dominated by a talented defense (yes, we all know what Cam Newton did, but lets also remember what the Broncos D did to him in the Super Bowl) with a game manager under center.

In an ideal world, that sounds a lot like the possible route for ... the Texans? Maybe they do know what theyre doing after all.",[]

Ken Morgan, collection manager of reptiles at Phoenix Zoo, talks about how to be safe from scorpion stings. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic)

PHOENIX  It's not yet peak scorpion season, but already Arizonans are getting stung by the little critters. A wet January and a hot February mean the scorpions are out earlier than usual this year.

Of the 55 types of scorpions in Arizona, there's only one that's likely to cause severe medical problems. The problem child is the bark scorpion. It's one of the smallest varieties, but it packs the biggest punch.

The bad news? The bark scorpion is also the most common type and is frequently found in peoples homes. According to the National Park Service, the bark scorpion is also the most venomous in all of North America. The Poison and Drug Information Center at Banner-University Medical Center Phoenix has already dealt with 588 calls regarding scorpion stings. That's a 46% increase from last year's numbers.

By the time peak season rolls around in August, hospital officials say, they'll be dealing with thousands of calls every month. For reference, the bark scorpion is light brown in color (allowing it to blend in well with the desert), reaches 2 to 3 inches in length at maturity and has long and slender tail segments and pincers. It also glows green under UV light.

There are many ways to minimize your family's risk of getting stung, so consider taking these precautions:

1. Do not leave a babys crib unprotected.

The bark scorpion is the best climber of its species and can climb on anything but clean plastic and glass, because those surfaces are too smooth. It can be found on ceilings, cement walls and shower curtains, and in clothing closets and food storage areas.

To prevent a scorpion from climbing or falling into a babys crib, move the crib away from the wall, take off any crib skirts that touch the floor, and place the legs of the crib in glass jars. Also consider getting a crib netting or building a scorpion shield not just over a babys crib, but over all the beds in the house. A scorpion shield is a rectangular piece of foam that hangs over a crib or a bed, which is meant to catch any scorpions that fall from the ceiling.

2. Do not get into bed without looking.

Banner Poison and Drug Information Center conducted a study that found that 33% of scorpion sting victims were stung in the bedroom, 24% in the living room and 6% in the bathroom.

So before climbing into bed for the night, be sure to roll back the bed linens and check for any critters that might have climbed in.

The easiest way to spot a scorpion in a house is to use a black light after dark. Theyll have a color similar to a green glow stick.

3. Do not put on shoes or clothing without checking.

The study also showed that 60% of people were stung on the hand or the foot. The bark scorpion is small, usually only 1 to 1.5 inches in length, so it can hide in lots of tight spaces. Shake or examine all clothing and shoes before putting them on.

4. Do not go outside barefoot.

This is critical  especially if you live in an area prone to scorpions. Take that extra minute and throw on a pair of close-toed shoes. Scorpions are most active at night and like places that are dark and damp, so be especially careful around swimming pools.

Maureen Roland, a clinical educator and outreach coordinator at Banner Poison and Drug Information Center, said one eco-friendly way to combat scorpions is spreading diatomaceous earth in your backyard. This powder can be purchased at places like Walmart and Home Depot and is made of finely crushed fossilized algae. It is deadly to little critters who crawl in it but non-toxic to your family.

Fun facts about scorpions. Wochit

5. Make your home uninviting.

Scorpions are looking for three things: food, water and shelter. Pest control is important because scorpions will be attracted to bugs like crickets, ants and cockroaches. Be sure to fix leaky faucets, water pipes or roofs. Leave pet dishes empty at night and don't leave damp towels lying around. Pick up clutter like papers or magazines, as these are great hiding places for little scorpions.

What to do if youre stung:

Fortunately the majority of stings can be managed at home with basic first aid measures:

 DO clean the site with soap and water.

 DO use a cool compress.

 DO position the affected limb to a comfortable position.

 DO use over the counter medication as needed for minor discomfort.

 Do call the poison center at 1-800-222-1222 to have a poison expert help you determine if you need to go to the hospital.

Symptoms in children

Children younger than 10 are more likely to develop severe symptoms from a scorpion sting. You may notice uncontrollable crying, rapid or jittery eye movements and increased salivation. Kids may also constantly rub their nose and face to indicate facial numbness and tingling.

Adult reactions

For adults symptoms include immediate local pain or a burning sensation with no swelling or redness. Touching the site can cause great pain, numbness and tingling moving to parts of the body distant from the sting. Visual disturbances and/or uncoordinated eye movements. Difficulty swallowing, excessive drooling, slurred speech. Muscle twitching, restlessness, irritability, respiratory problems and possible respiratory arrest.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,12 Questions with Joey Logano,"['Est March', 'Jeff Gluck', 'A M']","As far as endurance races, Joey Logano believes he could drive 2,000 miles at Talladega Superspeedway with no problem. (Photo: Peter Casey, USA TODAY Sports)

Our series of weekly NASCAR driver interviews continues with Joey Logano. The Team Penske driver finished second to teammate Brad Keselowski last week at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Q: What is an errand or chore in your daily life people might be surprised to learn you do yourself?

A: Shoot, man. I dont think theres anything thats crazy. I wash my cars and clean the garage a lot. Thats kind of my thing. But thats a fun chore. I enjoy it.

Do you take out the trash?

Heck yeah I take out the trash! Thats not that crazy though. Everyone takes out the trash.

Q: If you could do any race over again, which race would you choose?

A: Atlanta, because its fresh on my mind. I hit the commitment cone there and killed our race (Logano finished 12th). Actually, Atlanta comes to mind on a lot of occasions. A few years ago (in 2013), we had the fastest car weve ever had. I think we had a loose wheel, and typical Atlanta  you have one mistake and it takes the whole race to make it up because there are never any cautions.

Q: The longest race of the year is 600 miles. How long of a race could you physically handle without a driver change?

A: Its different for everybody. You see some guys who get out of the car and theyre on their butt, and some guys can keep going. It depends how your car is handling that day. If its loose, youre not going to be able to go very far  your arms would fall off. (Laughs)

Six hundred miles seems like a long race, but do I feel like at the end of 600 miles I cant run any further? No, I feel like Ive got more in me. But what happens is you start to lose the focus you have. You need to be sharp the whole race, and eventually you start getting mentally tired and make little mistakes over and over.

But it depends on the track, too. There are certain racetracks where I feel like I could run 1,000 miles. At Talladega, you could run 2,000 miles and be fine. But 600 miles at Martinsville and youd want to put a bullet in your head. (Laughs) Thatd be awful!

Q: Lets say president of NASCAR was an elected position voted on by the drivers  and you decided to run. What would one of your campaign promises be?

A: Were not doing a bad job now, but theres always room for improvement. I think everyone is starting to work together more now, with the drivers council along with NASCAR. Thats a pretty big gain from what weve had. So what I would say has already been spoken through the council. Nothing huge stands out to me, although it would be nice for the (crew) guys to have a little less time in the garage and have a little easier schedule somehow.

But were making good progress on things. Were doing good, were moving forward, were getting there. There are always ideas everyone has. Even that clock they put in the Truck Series  that was something that came from the drivers council. So our opinions are being listened to and things are happening because of it.

PHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Joey Logano

Q: At the start of this year, exactly 2,900 drivers had ever raced in the Sprint Cup Series. Where do you rank among those 2,900?

A: I feel like Im near 100 right now. Maybe a little better than that. (Turns to public relations representative Jeremy Troiano, who tells Logano hes 53rd on the all-time wins list). Well, I feel like you measure yourself by wins, so if Im 53rd, then Im 53rd. Thats exactly how I feel about that. (Laughs)

Q: What do you think your reputation is  and is that reputation accurate?

A: Absolutely not, its not accurate. I know that. We talk about it all the time.

My reputation is different among different groups. You have your fans, your non-fans, your team, your crew, your family, your friends and then you have your peers. I think theyre all different and each of them have their separate opinions about you.

Obviously, the opinions that are most accurate are the ones that are closest to you  your crew, your friends, your family. Those people know who you are, and thats accurate.

The fans are a mixed bag. Some fans understand who I am and why I do things, and then there are some fans that have formed an opinion that I dont feel is who I am. And thats natural  if you dont really know someone, everyone forms an opinion. Thats part of life.

Some of the fans look at me as a villain or not a nice guy for some reason. I dont feel like thats the case, personally. So I disagree with that. But I dont let that affect me, either  because I know who I am. My friends and family and team know who I am, and they have my back. So I dont let someone who doesnt know me affect me.

Q: A famous chef wants you to invest in the new restaurant hes opening, but he wants you to pick the cuisine. What type of food would your restaurant serve?

A: Italian. Chicken parm. Duh! (Laughs)

Hey, have you ever had a fried peanut butter and jelly? I heard about this the other day.

No, I dont think so.

(Crew chief) Todd (Gordons) grandparents made them for him.

Like deep-fried?

No, theyd make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, butter it and make it like you make grilled cheese.

Wow, that sounds really good.

It kind of sounds awful to me.

But the peanut butter would be all melted, like when you put it on toast.

Yeah? I dunno. Ill have to give it a shot.

Q: What is the most daring thing youve done outside of racing?

A: The most daring? Im pretty conservative on a lot of things. I dont want to get hurt. Four-wheeling? Thats not very daring, unless youre jumping it. But I dont do that, I keep it on the ground.

Troiano: Have you ever watched him play sports? Thats pretty daring.

Logano: You know what? Just because Im not coordinated doesnt mean I cant kick your ass. (Laughs) Hey, I beat you in sports a lot.

Tire specialist Dave Mule Nichols (pretending to hold a video game controller): Yeah, A-B, A-B, L-R, L-R.

Logano: (Laughs hysterically.)

Q: In a move to generate more excitement, NASCAR decides in an upcoming race theyre going to require every driver to have a passenger in the car. You get to pick the passenger. Who do you choose?

A: Mule! (Logano and Mule both laugh)

Why would you pick him?

Itd be very entertaining. (Laughs) I think Mule would have plenty to say. Hes very witty. But the problem is, hed make me laugh the whole time and wed probably crash. But itd be fun.

Q: Last year, your question for the next interview was so good that I stole it to include in this years 12 Questions. So now Ill throw it back at you: How often do you talk inside the car without hitting the radio button?

A: Id say less than 5% of the words I say are without hitting the button. Its not much at all.

Q: Who will win the Sprint Cup in 2021?

A: Me? Me. (Smiles)

Youll still be here.

Shoot, man! Im only 25. Cmon, geez! Im still going to be here. You dont think Im going to be around anymore? (Laughs)

No, I was saying Youll still be here with a period, not a question mark.

Well yeah, then me. With an exclamation point.

Q: Ive been asking each driver to give me a question for the next interview. The last interview was with Johnny Sauter...

A: Oh man! Johnny is the man!

...and he wanted to know: If you could do anything to improve the racing, what would it be?

Well, its what were looking for already  more (tire) falloff, to be able to race around each other more. Its the direction were already moving to take downforce off. We can already tell a difference when were behind other cars, how we can stay close and pass guys and all that. Wed go further if we could  adding mechanical grip and taking away aero grip is what I think this whole garage has bought into.

And do you have a question for the next interview? Its with Martin Truex Jr.

What do you think has changed from when you were racing for top 10s to now racing for wins? And not what has changed in your team, but what has changed in you? Like mentally, in your psyche.

Six students at the University of California-Santa Cruz were arrested last week in what Santa Cruz police are calling an international drug scheme, according to the Santa Cruz Police Department.

The students  Mariah Dremel, Benny Liu, Cesar Casil, Nathan Tieu, Cecilia Le and Hoai Nguyen  all 21 years old, were found with 5,000 tablets of MDMA, or ecstasy, with a street value of over $100,000.

Multiple shipments of the drug were sent to the students at three different homes in Santa Cruz, the police say. The drugs were recovered by members of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Department of Homeland Security, Drug Enforcement Administration and Santa Cruz Police Department.

The students are members of the Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi sorority, which are affiliated, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The drug alters perception and awareness, as well as increasing emotions of trust and lowering inhibitions oftentimes resulting in sexual exploitation. This dangerous combination undermines the efforts of affirmative consent work undertaken by many college campuses, Santa Cruz Police Department spokeswoman Joyce Blaschke told the Times in a statement.

Each Greek organizations Santa Cruz chapter announced Tuesday they would temporarily suspend their activities and functions, also according to the Times. Calls to the chapters for comments made by USA TODAY College have not yet been returned.

Given the seriousness of the allegations, the university has placed these students on interim suspension pending the outcome of campus judicial proceedings overseen by student conduct officers. Disciplinary action, following appropriate due process, can include expulsion, provost Alison Galloway said in an email statement sent to the campus on Tuesday.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Dos Equis retiring its 'Most Interesting Man in the World',"['Est March', 'Hadley Malcolm', 'A M']","Dos Equis doesn't always retire their 'Most Interesting Man,' but when they do, they send him to Mars. Here's a look back at some of our favorite one-liners from the thirsty spokesman. USA TODAY

Jonathan Goldsmith waves goodbye in his last ad spot as Dos Equis' ""Most Interesting Man in the World."" Dos Equis is retiring Goldsmith's version of the character as it aims to revamp its image. (Photo: Dos Equis/Havas)

After roughly nine years, the brewer of Dos Equis beer has decided maybe the world's reigning ""Most Interesting Man"" isn't so interesting anymore.

As a result, the tan, suave, impressively bearded ""Most Interesting Man in the World"" is about to embark on his final journey over the next few months before fading into the pantheon of advertising icons.

But the man, who jaunts around the world on enviable adventures while often surrounded by beautiful women, certainly made life more interesting  and successful  for the previously under-the-radar Mexican beer brand.

Dos Equis, owned by Amsterdam-based brewer Heineken, nearly tripled its business since the campaign was introduced, says Andrew Katz, vice president of marketing for Dos Equis. In the past year alone, sales of Dos Equis Lager Especial grew 10.2% to $325.3 million in the 52 weeks ended Jan. 24, says market research firm IRIWorldwide. The number of cases Dos Equis shipped between 2007 and 2015 grew by 34.8%, according to the company. Heineken estimates that about 25% of its future growth will come from the Dos Equis brand, helped by its appeal to the growing population of Latino men.

Though the specific character played in TV ads by veteran actor Jonathan Goldsmith, 77, won't be back, another equally interesting and likely younger man will take his place, Katz says. Dos Equis plans to revamp the popular commercials in order to keep their edge for a new generation of customers.

""Culture has changed very dramatically"" since the commercials debuted, Katz says. ""Our Millennial drinker has changed quite dramatically, and the competition has only exploded with the advent of craft (beer). We just want to make sure that the (Most Interesting Man) story evolves.""

Besides catapulting a relatively small brand into the minds of beer drinkers, the Man developed a cult following. The campaign debuted regionally in 2007 and went national in 2009, quickly taking over the Internet and pop culture by inspiring Most Interesting Man Halloween costumes and endless memes riffing on The Man's tagline, ""I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I drink Dos Equis.""

Fans have co-opted the phrase to relate to even the most mundane life events: ""I don't always finish a bottle of shampoo, but when I do, I leave it in the shower for the next two months."" Numerous compilations have sprung up to chronicle the myriad one-liners that explain what makes the Most Interesting Man so interesting. Sample: ""Sharks have a week dedicated to him"" and ""Presidents take his birthday off.""

Goldsmith tells USA TODAY that the character has succeeded for a simple reason: He ""made millions of people smile over these many years,"" he says. ""There is a real connection with the fun and authenticity of the character, which I portray with the same joy and passion that is part of my own life.""

And he has sold millions of dollars worth of suds. The character was hatched as the craft-beer craze was emerging, helped later by the genre's appeal to Millennials. Sales by the case of craft brews increased 11.5% in the 52 weeks ended Jan. 24, while domestic beer case sales grew just 0.6% in the same period, according to IRIWorldwide.

Working in Dos Equis' favor, though, is that imported beers are also becoming more popular, with case sales up 9.7% in the past year. Within the category, Dos Equis sold 8.1% more cases of its Lager Especial than in the previous 52-week period and was the fourth most popular beer behind Heineken, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra.

Mexican beers are responsible for much of the growth in imported beer because ""they are oftentimes considered more premium and appeal to both the growing Hispanic-American population and consumers looking for a slice of paradise,"" according to a report out from Euromonitor last year. ""Mexican beers have an aura of vacation and relaxation that appeals to many U.S. consumers.""

What has made Dos Equis ads so successful is that they are both unexpected and aspirational, says Allen Adamson, a marketing expert and founder of Brand Simple Consulting. Dos Equis created a character ""every guy wants to grow up and be like,"" Adamson says. ""They went out and did something quirky. It has broken through and helped Dos Equis go from a regional brew to a big brand.""

Dos Equis is releasing almost no details about the new campaign, only that a different actor will take over as Most Interesting Man later this year. The ads will keep their core identity, though.

Dos Equis knows that change can be divisive, which is why the brand along with the creative agency behind the ads, Havas, have spent the last year and a half thinking about the campaign's next move, says Jim Hord, Havas' executive creative director. The first potential hazard: ""I think people see the character and Jonathan as the same person,"" he says. ""Hopefully as we evolve the campaign, theyll get over that.""

But first, Dos Equis will ride Goldsmith's departure for the next several months. The brand has plans for a social media campaign leading up to Cinco de Mayo using the hashtag #adiosamigo and will distribute life-size cardboard cutouts of Goldsmith to grocery stores and bars for fans to pose with. The brand will also give customers the chance to win some of the Most Interesting Man's possessions, like his mariachi suit, plus a grand prize trip to Mexico. Then, it will be time to move on.

""Were viewing this as an opportunity to bring new users along with us,"" Katz says. ""To bring younger drinkers into the franchise who can better relate to a different Most Interesting Man in the World.""

usatoday.com,2016-02-17 00:00:00,9 ways to sneak more vegetables into your diet,"['Spoon University', 'The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Im not saying I hate vegetables, but I do hate salads. Nothing tastes worse to me than gnawing on raw veggies for a meal. But because vegetables are so important to ones diet, here are some ways to add variety and color to your college diet.

Omelettes

Omelettes are the perfect way to add in those veggies that you know you despise alone. After a quick sautee, vegetables provide a unique blend of textures, spiciness, and a blast of color to your breakfast. Add mushrooms, spinach, peppers, or collard greens to your eggs and if that doesnt seem to taste any better, just add some bacon and cheese as well.

Bites or Boats

Whether you are a pizza addict or nacho lover, turn those carbs into veggies substituting zucchini as the perfect way to crush those cravings. Once you peel and carve the zucchini into a boat shape, your favorite toppings can be layered on and baked to make the perfect dinner.

Try nacho zucchini boats topped with ground beef, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and mounds of cheese. Or make spaghetti squash boats if zucchini isnt your thing.

Risotto

An authentic, Italian-style risotto can turn the tables. Risotto in itself is a pleasurable treat but with the addition of chicken and loaded with veggies, the risotto is transformed. With the help of chicken broth, garlic, and butter, vegetables such as peas, mushrooms, beets, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower will go down easily.

Soup

The easiest way to use just about any vegetable is in a hearty soup like minestrone or gazpacho. With the help of pan-fried bacon and garlic, literally any vegetable can be thrown into this simple soup. Some veggies to try include spinach, beans, carrots, tomatoes, collards, swiss chard, cabbage, celery, onion, zucchini, and potatoes. To make this soup even better, add pasta.

Noodles

Get rid of those carbs and use vegetables instead to make a lighter and healthier noodle. Though this may not sound too appealing to some individuals, adding sauce and other toppings such as meat or cheese can really turn the tables around. These noodles can be made out of sweet potato or zucchini and if youre really lazy, try spaghetti squash.

Chips

Want something to snack on? Try veggie chips. Not only are these snacks nutritious, but they also last long and can be spiced up with any kind of seasonings. The most common veggie chips are made out of kale, carrots, green bean, sweet potato, zucchini, and radish. With the help of olive oil, paprika, breadcrumbs, cheese, herbs or spices, the vegetables are transformed.

Bread

Take your banana bread game to the next level by adding zucchini. With the banana overload, you wont even taste the difference. Use other healthy ingredients like greek yogurt, honey, applesauce, and coconut oil to make the perfect treat. To make the bread even sweeter, add chocolate, coconut shavings, dried fruit, and chopped nuts.

Smoothies

For a sweet and healthy treat, add spinach or kale to a fruity smoothie to mix in some more vitamins and minerals. With the help of yogurt, orange juice, or milk, fruits and veggies can be blended perfectly so you dont even have to taste the leafy greens. Try mixing orange juice, chia seeds, frozen strawberries and blueberries, spinach and kale.

Muffins

Sweet chocolate and rich avocado make the perfect match for the ultimate muffin. Eating this treat fills you with good fats which are an important source of omega 3s and reduce total cholesterol in the body. Avocado helps this delicious chocolate muffin feel lighter, taste more intense, and makes it super smooth. Try avocado truffles, pudding, and brownies as well.

The Supreme Court is asked to hear a case about same-sex adoptions. (Photo: AP)

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously reversed an Alabama court's refusal to recognize a same-sex adoption.

The justices upheld a challenge brought by an Alabama woman after her state's highest court refused to recognize the adoption she and her former lesbian partner were granted in Georgia.

The couple never married and have since split up. But the case presented a test of an issue that crops up occasionally in state and federal courts since the Supreme Court struck down state bans on same-sex marriage: Can gays and lesbians be denied adoption rights?

The case was brought by ""V.L.,"" as she is identified in court papers, against her former partner ""E.L.,"" who gave birth to three children between 2002-04 while the couple was together. To win adoption rights for V.L., they established temporary residency in Georgia.

Now that they have split, E.L. agreed with the Alabama Supreme Court, which ruled in September that Georgia mistakenly granted V.L. joint custody. E.L.'s lawyers argued that ""the Georgia court had no authority under Georgia law to award such an adoption, which is therefore void and not entitled to full faith and credit.""

Not so, the Supreme Court ruled. ""A state may not disregard the judgment of a sister state because it disagrees with the reasoning underlying the judgment or deems it to be wrong on the merits,"" its reversal said. Rather, Alabama must give ""full faith and credit"" to the Georgia court's decision.

The high court previously had blocked the Alabama court's action while considering the case, temporarily restoring V.L.'s visitation rights.

Adoption rights for same-sex couples are among the issues remaining in the wake of the high court's June decision legalizing same-sex marriage. About 30 states grant ""second-parent adoptions"" to gay and lesbian couples by law or lower court rulings. Such adoptions benefit adults who do not share a biological connection, while ensuring that children have two legal parents  particularly in case one dies or is incapacitated.

Lawyers for V.L., including the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the case has broad implications for any gay or lesbian adoptive parents who travel or move to Alabama.

The Supreme Courts reversal of Alabamas unprecedented decision to void an adoption from another state is a victory not only for our client but for thousands of adopted families, Cathy Sakimura, the center's family law director, said. No adoptive parent or child should have to face the uncertainty and loss of being separated years after their adoption just because another states court disagrees with the law that was applied in their adoption.

The case could affect other states that challenge or deny same-sex adoptions, according to a brief submitted by adoption and child welfare agencies.

""While at least 30 states have permitted second-parent adoptions, almost all of them have done so under statutory frameworks that, like Georgias, do not expressly embrace the concept,"" the brief says. ""As a result, the number of children who could be adversely affected by the Alabama Supreme Courts decision is large.""

The lawyers told the justices in court papers that same-sex adoptions ""have been granted since at least the mid-1980s, long before same-sex couples could marry."" They estimated that hundreds of thousands of such adoptions now exist.

The most recent statistics from the Williams Institute at UCLA indicate an estimated 65,000 adopted children live with a lesbian or gay parent.

usatoday.com,2011-07-23 00:00:00,5 reasons why: TV gets college life wrong,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Cathryn Sloane', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Few things are more colorful than the world of college  thirsty Thursdays, coffee-driven all-nighters at the library, walks of shame, crazy professors  theres just so much going on. Thats why it absolutely baffles me that I have never been able to find a TV show that can correctly depict this crazy alternate reality we live in. If one show could just get it right, I guarantee it would be a huge hit that endless students would spend their time obsessing over. Granted, we have done this anyway with a number of shows  both about college and not about college  and they have sufficiently satisfied us. But we all know that most of the scenes of college life these shows present to us are simply exaggerated stereotypes  not the true campus craziness we all live and breathe. Lets examine a few details:

1. Dorm rooms

It really depends on the college, but we all know that no dorm room is a luxury. These small confinements typically give you just enough space to get out of your bed, pass your closet and make your way over to your desk  and lets not forget you are sharing this limited space with another person who has just as much if not more stuff than you do. Any dorm room Ive ever seen on TV looks at least twice the size of a normal one. And on top of all this, the characters still always have the nerve to complain about how tiny their residence is. Ill take the most extreme example from Gilmore Girls. Now, let me say that this brilliant show is an all-time favorite of mine, but when Rory packs up and moves on to the newly exciting and intimidating world of college, things arent kept completely realistic. She moves into a suite with three other girls that is basically a palace  I have yet to find even a college apartment that is this spacious and amazing. Rory and her suitemates not only get an enormous common room big enough for a full-blown couch and a TV equipped with an entertainment center, but also a pair of two-person bedrooms that are the size of the typical fictional dorm room Ive already mentioned. I guess I had the same layout when I lived in a dorm suite my sophomore year  only the bedrooms were half the size and our common rooms were the kitchen and the bathroom. And believe me, Im not complaining, that was a sweet deal for living in a residence hall. But thats typically as expansive as it gets.

2. The clothes

Has anyone else noticed that pretty much everybody in the TV college world is always dressed nicely? I was watching an episode of Greek the other day and noticed Casey and Evan wearing outfits that could be described as business casual as they made their way to class at 9 a.m. I dont think Ive ever shown up to a class that early wearing something other than sweatpants. You just dont see college students that well put together before noon  especially just to go to class, because odds are we got very little sleep the night before. Whether that was due to cramming for an exam or downing multiple tequila shots at a frat party, we are not waking up in the mood to spend more than five minutes brushing our hair or picking out what to wear.

3. The student union

During the college years of the beloved classic Boy Meets World, Cory, Topanga and the rest of the gang can almost always be found chilling at the student union. From my experience, the student union is where we go to study if the library is too packed, not to hang out. TV shows seem to think the student union is the happening place on campus, the cool spot to be, the place where youre guaranteed to run into all your friends and peers. Sure, its a good area to stop by once in awhile for a coffee or quick meal in between classes, but I dont think Ive ever received a text saying, were all at the student union! come over! That just makes no sense.

4. The parties

OK, now for the most part these are fairly accurate in the TV college world. Obviously many college students drink and party, and they tend to do just that on TV. But the difference is that the party-throwers on TV seem to have money, and lots of it. At least, thats what I would infer from the large amount of detail and work that goes into these TV college parties. For one thing, almost every house party I see on Greek includes a bartender, which I wouldnt say is out of the ordinary, but these bartenders are not mixing drinks with just anything  theyve got bottles and bottles of expensive and classy-looking vodka. In real life, if there even is someone bartending the party, hes usually using the cheapest bottles of vodka sold at the local liquor store. And hes pouring these drinks into plastic cups, not the nice glasses you see Rory and Logan drinking out of at parties on Gilmore Girls. Additionally, parties in both of these shows tend to be very well equipped with colorful hanging lights and huge, intense stereo systems. In reality, no one puts much more effort into a party than a keg of beer, an iPod connected to speakers and trays of jello shots if theyre feeling really ambitious.

5. Nobody goes to class

Seriously, all these kids seem to do is catch up at the student union, mention a homework assignment or two, walk around the quad in a nice outfit, get drunk at a party and do it all over again the next day. The fact that classes literally take over our lives Monday through Friday (or Thursday, to be exact) seems to totally escape the lives of these characters. Most of us rarely have the time or the energy to do something other than attend class, study or sleep during the week  hey, thats why we do let loose on the weekends!

Although their college worlds are a bit far off from ours in many ways, I still consider these shows (and many others) staples for us college students. Weve all experienced at least a couple of stereotypical college situations that would be portrayed in these shows, and I think watching them gives us a perfect reminder to not let the stress take us over and to remember these truly are some of the best years of our lives.

The name of the victim was not released, although Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld confirmed that the victim was an American citizen who was stabbed in a knife attack that left 10 other people wounded. The attacker, who was identified as a Palestinian, was shot and killed, Rosenfeld said.

The violence in Jaffa was part of a series of attacks Tuesday that included a shooting in Jerusalem where two police officers suffered serious gunshots wounds before the assailant wielding an automatic weapon was shot and killed by border police, Rosenfeld said. That incident occurred near the Damascus gate in Jerusalems Old City, the police spokesman said. There was also a separate knife attack in Jerusalem by a woman who was shot to death by police.

Bidens office issued a statement Tuesday that condemned the attacks in Jaffa. Biden expressed his sorrow at the tragic loss of American life and offered his condolences to the family of the American citizen murdered, the statement said.

The tourist was the second American killed in Israel in recent weeks. A 21-year-old off-duty Israeli soldier died in a knife attack on the West Bank in February. The soldier, Tuvya Weisman, held duel U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

An ongoing series of knife attacks, car rammings and shootings date back to September when they were believed to have been triggered by tensions over a sensitive holy site in the Old City. At least 28 Israelis and 176 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Associated Press.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why 'The People v. O.J. Simpson' still has everyone talking,"['Est March', 'Usa Today', 'Erin Jensen', 'A M']","The prosecution from ""The People v. O.J. Simpson"" mini-series. (Photo: Ray Mickshaw, FX)

FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson has been a huge success -- in terms of outspoken and addicted viewers, that is. Following the sixth episode, the what-is-real and who-did-what buzz is still going. We decided to take a closer look at the engaging series and why it's got everyone talking.

Though the depiction might not have been entirely accurate, Tuesday's episode, titled Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, gave us a feel for the type of hell that prosecutor Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson) faced during the 1995 trial.

Marcia was going through a messy divorce from her second husband, Gordon Clark, who was fighting for primary custody of her two young children because he believed that Marcia spent too much time at work.

She also faced criticism for her appearance. Even her boss, Los Angeles County District Attorney, Gil Garcetti, (Bruce Greenwood) offered to set Marcia up with media consultants, as one does.

Marcia fielded snarky remarks from Johnnie Cochran (Courtney B. Vance) who seemed to belittle her responsibilities as a parent, and dealt with her soon-to-be ex accusing her of lying to get out of the trial on television.

After weathering all of the criticism, we see Marcia in a salon chair asking for a ""softer"" look, which one man in the show said made her look like Rick James. As if that wasn't enough, the National Enquirer published photos of a topless Marcia on vacation with her first husband, Gabriel Horowitz.

This woman could not catch a break!

Toward the end of the episode, Detective Mark Fuhrman (Steven Pasquale), was asked repeatedly if he ever used a racial slur. Fuhrman denied it, though later in the actual trial, excerpts from recorded interviews were played in the court, and Fuhrman could be heard using the word.

Up to this point in the mini-series, we have seen the murder scene, a distraught Simpson contemplating suicide at friend Robert Kardashian's house and his subsequent car chase in Al Cowlings' white bronco.

We've also gotten a glimpse of what race relations were like after the Los Angeles Riots. We saw Cochran instruct his children not to say anything to the police after he was pulled over, and how race came into play for the defense and prosecution during jury selection. Cochran also made over Simpson's house in an effort to connect with black members of the jury.

Needless to say, it's been an emotional and consuming ride.

In a preview for episode 7, Marcia can be seen professing, ""The gloves are our conviction,"" a lead-in to the infamous defense line, ""If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.""

The People v. O.J. Simpson airs Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET on FX. Check back for more of our takes through the rest of the season.

Glennon would be a serviceable fallback option if the Broncos chose to go in that direction, but Colin Kaepernick and Robert Griffin III are better fits in head coach Gary Kubiak's offense. Regardless of which one winds up in Denver, none of them figure to be anything more than a QB2 for fantasy purposes.",[]

usatoday.com,2015-06-10 00:00:00,14 big stocks that should split next,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Investors love their stock splits. Hopes are high that video-streamer Netflix (NFLX) will soon announce a split  and make them cool again.

Companies have shied away from doing stock splits for so long  theres a long list of stocks that would be ripe for one, including biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Each of these stocks trade above nosebleed levels of $200 a share or more  but are also up 25% or more over the past year showing momentum is working in their favor, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.

Stock splits are maneuvers where a company increases the number of shares outstanding  as a way to lower the per-share stock price. Companies often conduct splits to make the shares appear more palatable to individual investors who might wince at a $200 or higher per-share price.

Here are the S&P 500 stocks that should seriously consider a split (notice Netflix is on there):

S&P 500 STOCKS TRADING FOR $200 A SHARE OR MORE THAT ARE UP 25% OR MORE OVER THE PAST YEAR

Company Symbol 6/10/2015 price 1-year % ch. Humana HUM $212.40 67.9% Regeneron Pharm. REGN $508.15 64.2% Netflix NFLX $682.61 59.4% OReilly Auto ORLY $225.58 48.6% Actavis ACT $300.12 44.7% Sherwin-Williams SHW $280.86 37.4% Intuitive Surgical ISRG $505.43 33.9% CF Industries CF $319.64 31.6% Amazon.com AMZN $431.64 29.9% Equinix EQIX $261.50 29.5% Goldman Sachs GS $213.15 28.1% AutoZone AZO $679.79 27.7% McKesson MCK $235.58 26.9% Intercontinental Exchange ICE $239.05 25.7%

The economic effect on investors from splits is a net zero  since the dollar value of the shares are cut by the same proportion that shares outstanding are increased. Your position in 100 shares of a stock trading for $200 a share is exactly the same value as a position in 200 shares trading for $100 a share.

Mathematically, splits may be a wash. But there appears to be a psychological reason investors like them so much. Shares of the seven companies in the Standard & Poors 500 that have split their shares over the past year are up an average of 7% since their splits. That edges out the 5% gain by the S&P 500 during the same time periods. And five of the seven stocks that split beat the S&P 500. Now you can see why investors like them so much.

But while investors love stock splits  and the stocks tend to outperform  companies have been shying away from them since the late 2000s. Splits fell out of favor during the period as there was instead a sort of prestige having a high share price, says Jon Johnson of StockSplits.net. The anti-split era reached a peak as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) raced to have the highest per-share prices.

But since then  both companies have split their shares. Johnson expects Netflix to be next. Once that happens, expect more companies to follow. Now that the ice has been broken, more companies will split, he says.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,AP source: Texans agree to multi-year deal with QB Osweiler,"['Est March', 'P M']","(Photo: The Associated Press)

HOUSTON (AP)  The Houston Texans have filled their biggest need, starting free agency with a splash by snagging Brock Osweiler from Denver.

A person familiar with the negotiations said the free agent quarterback agreed to multiyear contract with the team on Wednesday.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal hadn't been announced by the team.

The Broncos hoped to keep Osweiler in the wake of Peyton Manning's retirement on Monday.

Instead he's heading to Houston where the Texans were looking to upgrade the position after Brian Hoyer's struggles last season, particularly his turnover-filled performance in their wild-card playoff loss to Kansas City.

Osweiler appeared in eight games with seven starts last season for the Super Bowl champion Broncos. He started the last seven games of the regular season, but was benched in favor of Manning for the postseason. The 6-foot-7, 240-pound player spent the first four years of his career with the Broncos after being drafted in the second round in 2012 out of Arizona State.

He threw for a career-high 1,967 yards and 10 touchdowns with six interceptions last season. Osweiler only played sparingly in his first three seasons in Denver and never threw for 100 yards in a season until last year.

Hoyer remains on Houston's roster after signing a two-year contract before last season, but his five-turnover fiasco in the loss to the Chiefs made it clear that Houston needed a change at the position.

Adding Osweiler comes after a season where Houston was forced to use four different quarterbacks. Struggles by Hoyer got him benched in the season opener and the Texans started Ryan Mallett for four games.

But he won just one of those games and soon Hoyer was starting again and Mallett was released after missing a team flight. The Texans started both T.J. Yates and Brandon Weeden late in the season when Hoyer missed three games because of two concussions in less than a month.

Osweiler's decision leaves the Broncos with Trevor Siemian as the only quarterback on their roster. The seventh-round pick took just one snap as a rookie last season.

Some of the art of making great pancakes is simple common sense: measure your ingredients carefully, sift your flour to reduce the lumps, don't over-mix the batter. And for heaven's sake, only flip each pancake once! Once you've mastered the most basic techniques, however, there's room to bring your craft to the next level. Take this advice from five celebrity chefs who have a thing or two to say about the perfect pancake. Related 10 Great Holiday Cookie Recipes From Celebrity Chefs

Alton Brown: Two Kinds of Flour While virtually every pancake recipe out there calls for all-purpose flour, celebrity chef Alton Brown suggests using a mixture of all-purpose flour and cake flour. His version involves a rough 2:1 ratio of all-purpose flour to cake flour. The best thing about Alton's method is that you can easily make this adjustment to your current pancake recipe without changing your technique. This tiny alteration will improve the consistency of your batter and make for light, fluffy pancakes. Note: Alton Brown isn't the only one using cake flour in his pancakes.

Gordon Ramsay: Separate Yolks & Whites Your favorite cranky Scot wants to make your pancake recipe more difficult. But don't be so quick to dismiss this pro tip from Gordon Ramsay; it's no kitchen nightmare and it'll make your pancakes unbelievably fluffy. The technique? Separate your egg whites from your egg yolks. Whisk the yolks in with the rest of your wet ingredients. Then combine the wet and the dry as you normally would. (Don't over-mix!) In ""an extremely clean bowl, free of fat,"" whisk your egg whites to stiff peakslike you would for a meringue or souffle. Then gently fold the egg whites into your batter. Credit: Flickr user ""indiamos"" Gordon Ramsay's pro tip: Separate your egg whites, beat them into medium-stiff peaks, then gently fold them into your batter.

Mario Batali: Brown Sugar For famed chef and restauranteur Mario Batali, pancakes literally have a secret ingredient: brown sugar. He gives all credit to his sons, whose Sunday morning pancakes make for instant family joy. You can't just throw the brown sugar in, though. Mario says that to get it right, you have to have a little more technique than that: ""When you are done whisking the batter, crumble two tablespoons of brown sugar on top and barely mix it in."" It's all in the wrist. Credit: Flickr user ""las - initially"" The Batali family secret pancake ingredient: brown sugar.

Jamie Oliver: The Right Temperature This may seem like common sense, but too many pancakes suffer a common fate: burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. To help you find that perfect temperature for your pan or griddle, Jamie Oliver recommends a simple trick of the trade: water. In his ""Top Tips"" for all-American pancakes, Oliver writes: To tell if the griddle is hot enough, add in a few drops of water and if it bounces across it for a second or two before evaporating the pan is at the right temperature. Credit: Flickr user ""jenwaller"" Make sure your griddle is at the perfect temperature or your pancakes will burn.

Paula Deen: Oil & Butter Paula Deen has gotten a lot of grief for her lavish use of butter and her generally unhealthy (but admittedly delicious) recipes. So, it might surprise you to learn that Paula's recommendation for greasing the griddle is actually healthier than most. Think you can just use a mixture of oil and butter and throw it down? Think again. Paula tells you to use a clean paper towel to wipe the griddle or pan with a ""neutral oil"" like canola. Then, lightly brush a small amount of melted butter on top of that. Between batches, repeat your oil-wiping, butter-brushing process. Credit: Flickr user ""jypsygen"" Paula Deen describes the perfect method for getting the right mixture of butter and oil.",[]

The biggest moves of the open market elicit these early evaluations.

QB Brock Osweiler, Houston Texans

4-year, $72 million contract

Perhaps a shocker to some, but the writing was on the wall when Denver switched back to Peyton Manning late last season, thus allowing Osweiler to have all the leverage.

The Texans have a primo wideout in DeAndre Hopkins and a competent game plan. Osweilers early success depends on assimilation and talent  he has some, for sure, but seven career starts make it difficult to gauge where he fits in.

Its likely as a glorified game manager with that strong defense  and newcomer Lamar Miller at running back  taking off some pressure. Osweiler is a modest QB2 target who figures to be overvalued in casual leagues.

RB Doug Martin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

5-year, $35.7 million contract

The NFLs second leading rusher finished with 1,402 yards and six scores in 2015s resurgent season, and his once-questionable return to the Buccaneers is now an afterthought.

Mileage and injury history are major sticking points for assessing his 2016 worth, but based on his merits, Martin warrants second-round RB1 consideration. Hes a higher pick in standard scoring than non-PPR.

RB Matt Forte, New York Jets

Contract details undisclosed

Age (30) and a yeomans workload diminish Fortes fantasy prospects. If third-down back Bilal Powell doesnt return to the Jets, we can safely say Forte at least has that role pinned down. The Jets are an older team, and should the team re-sign Ryan Fitzpatrick, New York appears to be in a win-now mode.

Forte is a reasonable No. 2 running back in point-per-reception leagues and a weaker version of that in standard setups.

RB Lamar Miller, Houston Texans

4-year, $26 million contract

Miamis coaching staff never seemed to know how to properly utilize the explosive back, so he opted to take his talents away from South Beach.

In Houston, Miller will probably see the majority of the touches. He profiles as a home run hitter, rather than a workhorse, goal line threat or third-down back. Some combination of Alfred Blue, Akeem Hunt and/or Jonathan Grimes will contend for spell duties. Miller is a high-ceiling second fantasy back with RB1 offerings in the right scenario.

WR Marvin Jones, Detroit Lions

5-year, $40 million contract

The retirement of Calvin Johnson meant the Lions desperately needed to address the position, so the consensus top wide receiver available was a good place to start.

Jones has the potential to do great things in Detroit, but the reality is he hasnt been exposed to a high level of pressure in the NFL. He has been shielded by A.J. Green and a run-first offensive system.

Take a chance on Jones as a third fantasy receiver, provided the hype doesnt lead to him being grossly overdrafted.

TE Coby Fleener, New Orleans Saints

5-year, $36 million contract

After Dwayne Allen re-upped with the Indianapolis Colts, the writing was on the wall for Fleeners departure.

Drew Brees now has his best tight end since, well, Jimmy Graham in 2014, but the leap from last years crop of line extensions to Fleener cannot be understated. Hes a midrange No. 1 fantasy tight end and could provide the best value at the position in 2016 drafts.

TE Ladarius Green, Pittsburgh Steelers

Contract details undisclosed

Speaking of likely to be overvalued, Green could be the poster boy in 2016 fantasy draft season. Flashes of sheer brilliance have been sprinkled in with long stretches of mediocrity and injury woes.

Some owners will remember Greens raw talent and forget his lack of consistency. Green will be one of many mouths to feed in a crowded offense. Some weeks hell shine, others hell lay goose eggs as a TE2 draft target.

TE Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers

2-year, $12 million contract

Green was once hyped as the next Antonio Gates in San Diego, but the soon-to-be 36-year-old gets the last laugh.

A Philip Rivers favorite, the elder statesman of NFL tight ends is a fringe starter and should be selected as such in traditional fantasy drafts.",[]

Mike Provost, a resident on Windsors Hillcrest Boulevard, has kept records of the hums heard throughout his neighborhood, he told the newspaper. He noted a particular blast on Saturday, Feb. 27, that shook everything ... like a pounding on the wall.""

Some people complain about dishes rattling, windows rattling, Provost told the Star. It can get real disturbing.

Concerns about the hum first arose several years ago on the western and southern ends of Windsor, which lies just south of Detroit across the Detroit River. One night in 2012, more than 22,000 residents phoned government officials about the hum during a call-in event.

A 2013 report in On Earth magazine described how the incessant sound disturbed thousands of residents in that time, vibrating their beds, wrecking their concentration, making their toddlers cranky. Some even blamed it for killing their goldfish.

The hum jolted resident Gary Grosse out of sleep at 2 a.m. one night, the magazine reported, driving him to try to hunt down the source in his car. Another resident, Sherry Kelly, heard the hum, too, but feared people would think she was crazy if she mentioned it.

The crew of a SyFy channel show even visited Windsor in 2013 and floated the idea that the hum was connected to HAARP, a U.S. communications program that conspiracy theorists said could control minds or the weather, depending on whom you ask. The show found no conclusions.

After myriad complaints, a 2014 report by the Canadian government linked the noise pollution to the work of U.S. Steel, based on Zug Island  a mass of land in the Detroit River just over the U.S.-Canadian border, the Star reported.

Experts think the hum could be the traveling sound of distant blasts from industrial furnaces releasing pressure on the American island, but jurisdictional complications have hamstrung Canadian officials in investigating operations there.

U.S. Steel, for its part, has cast doubt on the notion that it causes the hum.

An attorney of River Rouge, Mich., the municipality that oversees Zug Island, told the Star in 2012 that it didnt have resources to look into the problem.

We are not going to pay for something that is for somebody elses benefit because this is not a problem affecting us, David Bower said.

According to Provost, the Windsor resident tracking the hums return, the jolting noises have been worse around 8 p.m.

Come on, give me a break, he said. Let us get some sleep. Let us get some peace and quiet.

Sustainable tourism is thriving in Costa Rica. And none are more authentic than the day-long tour of the indigenous Kekoldi territory.

This adventure through the Talamanca region will show you a self-sufficient traditional society thriving in the modern age: maintaining ancient traditions through sustainable, organic agriculture.

The Bribri, Cabecar and Kekoldi people believe that God - Sibo - created them from two kernels of corn, divided geographically by a great river, but united at heart. According to tradition, Sibo gave them knowledge, a scientific and spiritual wisdom called Siwa.

Conveyed from generation to generation by way of stories, legends, and traditional practices, Siwa is based on the core belief that all Bribri are guardians and protectors of the Talamanca and all its natural diversity.

This deep commitment to the conservation of their native rainforests has urged the the Bribri, Cabecar and Kekoldi communities to activism.

In the face of environmental damage from development and drilling, they're doing everything they can to educate others about the importance of protecting all of Sibo's gifts.

Through eco-tourism initiatives, the indigenous people of Costa Rica offer opportunities to walk into their secluded enclaves and come away with a greater understanding of la pura vida.

Bribri shamans, Awa, draw upon the multitude of medicinal plants and flowers in this fertile rainforest. For healing and improving health, they invoke Siwa to apply nature's most potent medicinal powers.

Alongside the staples of cacao, corn, and bananas, pejibaye (peach palm), yucca, noni, guanabana (sour sop) and many organically cultivated superfruits are grown and harvested here.

When they saw the population of green iguanas dwindling towards extinction, the Kekoldi community created a program to protect and breed these majestic reptiles in the wild.

Today, the iguana verde population is thriving and they're no longer considered endangered.

Together, the Bribri, Cabecar and Kekoldi communities make up the Talamanca Indigenous Reserve, which was officially recognized by the Costa Rican government in 1977.

Recent DNA research suggests that modern-day Bribri, Cabecar and Kekoldi are related to some of the first people to populate the Americas, along with other tribes of the Chibchan language group that lie along the Isthmus of Panama.

These communities lie within La Amistad Talamanca Biological Corridor, a UNESCO World Heritage site, in the southeastern most corner of the Limon province.

Walking up to the highest waterfall in the Talamanca, you'll follow your guide into the primary and secondary forests and encounter a special birdwatching tower.

The Kekoldi community encompasses one of four million-raptor migration observation sites in the world. Thousands of migrating raptors fly overhead every autumn as they head south.

To Kekoldi, the migrating raptors are dancing gods, carriers who scatter the seeds of trees and to whom they attribute their thriving forests.

usatoday.com,2014-09-12 00:00:00,Buy and hold investors: Youre doing it wrong,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Talk about a perfect buy-and-hold stock market. Investors who just buy stocks  and do nothing  have ridden a pretty much straight line to riches.

But dont let the comfort of buying and holding lull you into making a number of serious mistakes that injure returns. Even long-term investors who arent daytrading need to pay attention to some strategic blunders that can cost them in the long run.

Theres no question buying and holding has been a winning strategy in this bull market. Just look at the Standard & Poors 500 over the past five years. It has been almost a perfect escalator ride higher. Sure, there were a few bumps in 2011 and 2012, but it was best to just ignore all that.

But with success breeds complacency. Eventually, the market will run into turbulence. And when it does, even if youre a long-term buy-and-hold investor, dont make the mistakes of:

* Treating individual stocks the same as indexes. If youre buying-and-holding individual stocks, you face special risks. Unlike buy-and-hold investors who buy diversified baskets of stocks  like index funds  youre subjected to the risk of individual companies. And you need to treat the situation much different.

Investors who bought accessory maker Coach (COH)  are a great example of this reality. Yes, the stock had been a monster winner between 2009 and early 2012. But once the stock started to crack, even buy-and-hold investors needed to be ready to bail out. Buy-and-hold investors who didnt get out of Coach have seen their 130% gains dwindle to just 11% over the past five years. They would have been better off holding a broad index fund.

Professional investors tell investors who buy individual stocks to be ready to get out once the stock falls 10% or more from the price paid. If thats too much drama for you, you should join other buy-and-hold investors who instead invest in diversified baskets of stocks. This charts shows you why:

* Failing to rebalance. Just the word rebalance sounds like a gymnastics maneuver. And to other buy-and-hold investors, rebalancing seems too much like meddling or trading. But just the opposite is the case, according to research from Vanguard. Rebalancing is the process of scaling back portions of your buy-and-hold portfolio that do relatively better than other parts. Its just like trimming back the green beans in your garden if they flourish so they dont overcrowd the strawberries.

A diversified investor should own key asset classes like large U.S. stocks, emerging markets, real-estate investment trusts and value stocks. When REITs do great, like they are now, its prudent to cut them back to the proper percentage of your portfolio. The power of rebalancing is powerful over time. Vanguard estimates that keeping a portfolio on target adds up to 0.35% a portfolio annually. That adds up to real money over time, as the chart below shows:

* Keeping your out-of-date portfolio. There are lots of things you did when you were in your 20s, that you probably shouldnt be doing in your 40s, 50s or 60s. Well let you fill in the blanks. The same goes for your portfolio. If you first put together your portfolio 20 years ago  to fit your needs and risk appetite then  you might need to adjust now.

Its not just theory. Lets say you crafted your portfolio when you were young and risk tolerant, like IFA.coms most aggressive portfolio. The most aggressive portfolio going might be one that has 24% U.S. company stock, 40% small U.S. company stock, 5% real estate, 18% international, 11% emerging markets and 0% bonds.

Sure, youd be happy with the long-term average returns of 11.2%. And the risk would be fine, too, when you didnt have much to gamble. But now that youre 40, 50 or 60, do you really want to have a portfolio that has an outstanding chance at falling 11% in any year and a very good chance of falling 34%?

Buy-and-hold investors, too, need to know enough to tweak their portfolios over time. Can you really handle the kind of volatility this aggressive portfolio can serve up  as shown in the chart below:

* Failing to have three to six-months of cash for emergencies. Its easy to buy-and-hold if you dont need the dough now. But its when cash demands come up, even buy-and-hold investors hands get forced. The trouble, too, is that investors often can see cash needs increase at the same time the market is depressed. During a recession, for instance, an investors income might be disrupted or reduced while stocks are in a bear market. Not having enough cash might force even a buy-and-hold investor to sell. That would be regrettable as it could undo years of discipline.

Professionals suggest having at least three months of living expenses on hand in cash  but preferably six months or more. Having this cash is critical for buy and hold investors so they can afford to buy and hold.

* Ignoring taxes. Buy and hold investors know they need mind fees. Avoiding commissions from rapid-fire trading stocks or incurring capital gains is a big justification for buy and hold. But that doesnt mean investors can assume thats the only leakage to be worried about.

One of the biggest hidden fees investors can deal with are taxes. Domestic stock fund lose 2 percentage points from annual returns due to taxes, Vanguard says, which cuts investors share of the markets long-term average returns by 20%.

Since buy-and-hold investors are likely to accumulate income from dividends paid, theres a good reason to mind taxes. One suggestion for buy-and-hold investors still working is to stuff bond holdings in tax-deferred accounts. That would keep the income of the high yielding instruments out of their annual income during their high earnings years, where it might be taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate. And buy-and-hold investors who buy funds  keep an eye on how much of a bite is going to pay the tax man.

Vanguard research has shown that, of all the expenses investors pay, taxes can potentially take the biggest bite out of total returns, according to a Vanguard research document titled Tax-efficient equity investing: Solutions for Maximizing After-Tax Returns.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,FBI and reveals what keeps him up at night,"['Est March', 'Marco Della Cava', 'P M']","Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, likens the situation between Apple and the FBI to the police getting records from a phone company. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP)

SAN FRANCISCO Bill Gates has weighed in again on the FBI vs. Apple case  plus his thoughts on Michael Bloomberg and the presidential race, virtual reality, and more ominously, on the rapid ascent of intelligent robots and the threat of nuclear terrorism.

Microsoft co-founder Gates, in his fourth ""Ask Me Anything"" chat on Reddit Tuesday, suggested Apple and the U.S. government could strike a balance ""between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases.""

Gates created a minor furor a few weeks ago after the Financial Times quoted him as downplaying Apple's concerns over the FBI's request it create software to override encryption on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers. He later said his remarks were mischaracterized.

Almost every major tech company has been party to a variety of amicus brief filings on Apple's behalf, including Microsoft. Industry lawyers have argued creation of an unlock software could put in jeopardy data of millions of consumers.

In the online forum's Q&A, Gates, 60, again showed some sympathy with the government's viewpoint. ""What if we had never had wiretapping?"" he asked, but at the same time added that ""very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense.

Gates covered a range of topics in his online AMA discussion, including mundane personal topics such as his love of sushi and how an obsession with reading often keeps him up too late. Among the other topics:

- Biggest fear

Asked what keeps him up at night, Gates was darkly blunt: ""The problem of how we prevent a small group of terrorists using nuclear or biological means to kill millions is something I worry about. If Government does their best work they have a good chance of detecting it and stopping it but I don't think it is getting enough attention and I know I can't solve it.""

- Robots

Gates clearly was not concerned that the coming age of robots would bode ill for humans  although admittedly his conclusion had spooky overtones.

Wrote Gates: ""I think robots that have vision and manipulation as good as humans is a huge milestone that will happen in the next decade and is being underestimated.""

- Virtual Reality

Gates cast his support for Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's decision to pursue an augmented reality device, HoloLens, which unlike virtual reality allows the user to see the real world as well as overlaid images.

""VR is the extreme case of AR when nothing from the real world gets mixed in,"" Gates wrote. ""It can be tricky if you are walking around that you might run into things. Systems that allow you to see the real world ""seem better than pure VR. ""

- Politics

Gates also obliquely shed light on his political views. While rejecting an offer to run for president, noting that his job helping guide the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation keeps him plenty busy, he did applaud Michael Bloomberg's recent decision not to run for office as an Independent out of concern that such a bid might split the Republican vote and guarantee a Donald Trump party nomination.

""I like my current job at the Foundation better than I would being President,"" Gates wrote. ""Also I wouldn't be good at doing what you need to do to get elected. I thought Michael Bloomberg was thoughtful about why it didn't make sense for him to try and run even though he is a great executive.""

usatoday.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,The best Caribbean beaches youve never heard of,"['Est March', 'Special For Usa Today', 'P M', 'Melanie Reffes']","They are the Caribbeans star attractions, but many of the best beaches have been eclipsed by throngs of sun-seeking tourists. Fear not, though: No matter which island you choose, we can help you find your own secret hiding place in the sand.

Anguilla

The official beach counter (yes, there is such a dream job) clocks the number of beaches on the pancake-flat isle at thirty-three. With plenty to choose from, the hands-down winner for the softest and sandiest goes to Barnes Bay, sandwiched between Meads Bay and West End Bay. It's not the easiest beach to find, but it's well worth the hunt for the shallow clear sea pools that are prime for swimming and snorkeling. On every beach baggers bucket list, the beach is a popular pit stop for the chic crowd that play and stay at the nearby Viceroy, the largest resort on the island.

Curacao

A bonanza for swimmers, snorkelers and aficionados of icy cold fruity daiquiris, Cas Abao hits the beach bullseye. Surrounded by cliffs and twenty miles northwest of the pastel-painted capital city of Willemstad, the sunny playground is coveted by beach junkies who come for the white-crested surf and casual vibe. Sea turtles and spotted eagle rays cavort below the waves while beach hoppers take five under thatched palapas and at the open-air Beach Bar built into the porch of an eighteenth century plantation house. Upping the ante, gazebos by the waterline are the go-to spot for a massage. With advance planning, the beach is a welcoming host for seaside family reunions and sunset weddings. Popular (but not crowded) with locals and tourists who do their beach research, the neighborhood strip near the town Fontein is accessible only by car and open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Entrance fees  USD $5.80 per person on weekdays, USD $7.20 on weekends  are well worth it.

Nevis

With honey-tinted sand that covers the distance between the capital city of Charlestown and the Sea Bridge Ferry Dock, Pinneys is a beach for the books. Poetry for seashell collectors and sand castle builders, the three-mile long beach is big enough not to feel crowded. A magnet for privacy-seekers like Beyonce, Mick Jagger and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who vacations on the island with his handsome brood, the main attraction after the clear water is Sunshines Beach Lounge, a seashell away from the swanky Four Seasons Resort where the A-list hang their hat. A colorful shack on the sand, the bar rocks for barbecue seafood, jerk chicken and nonstop pours of rummy Killer Bee Cocktails that sting even when downed in small sips.

Antigua

Look for Dennis Cocktail Bar and youll find Ffryes Beach  yes, with 2 fs  near the busier Jolly Harbour Beach and before Darkwood Beach. Family-friendly without toe-snagging rocks or reefs, the footprint-ready sandy blanket comes without hordes of tourists that clog up the other beaches. On the west coast, the flat beach is without amenities (bring your own umbrella, towels and snorkel gear) but is the real deal for swimming in the soothing surf, lolling on the sand or liming at the bar on the hill that Dennis owns where the curried conch is delectable and the Sunday afternoon steel pan players a delight.

Barbuda

This beach is so remote, the 15-mile stretch between Cedar Tree Point and Bill Point doesnt have a name. Fronting the eco-rustic Belle Barbuda, the out-of-the-way rose-tinted beach is perfectly deserted. Within the Codrington Lagoon Park on the small sister isle across the pond from Antigua, the no-name beach is Paradise Found for intrepid travelers lucky enough to find it and locals who already know where it is.

Barbados

On the west coast in the parish of St. Peter, Mullins Beach comes with beachy must-haves like sun beds, shady palms and gentle sand shelves that keep beginners in the shallow water all day. Less crowded than many of the sixty beaches that span the seventy square mile island, the beach sports the bright and breezy Mullins Beach Bar where spirited bartenders keep thirst at bay with rummy Mount Gay cocktails and frosty mugs of beer. A new parking area across the road is convenient for those with cars, while a bus stop in front of the beach is convenient for everyone else.

St. Maarten

Before Hurricane Luis took down the nearby hotel in 1995, Mullet Bay was the busiest beach on the island. Fast forward to today and the beach is far from busy except on Sundays when the locals come to fire up their grills, play a game of volleyball and boogie to local reggae bands rocking the sand. West of the Princess Juliana International Airport, close to the hotels in Maho and the condos in Cupecoy, and next to the golf course (the only one on the island), the bone-white beach sits in a moon-shaped bay with slow rolling waves that are nirvana for surfers. Rocks line the east and west sides which are favored by snorkelers, while for those up for something above the waves, catamarans take the sun happy on party sails. No-frills stands sell liquid refreshments and theres plenty of parking for those exploring the island in a rental car. On cloudless days, vistas of neighboring Saba and the sunset are awesome.

St. Martin

On the north side of the dual-nation island, Petite Plage or Little Beach in French might be better named the I want to be alone beach. A bastion of sunny secluded splendor, the skinny beach is next to the Grand Case Beach Club and a pleasant stroll to Grand Case Village at the northern end. The ocean is so clear you can wade in waist deep and see your own feet, while the sand is so soft youll be tempted to forgo the sun lounger in favor of a towel spread out by the waters edge. Leisurely mornings morph into afternoon siestas with nary a distraction apart from a resident pelican taking five on the offshore Creole Rock and the breeze rustling through the sea grape trees.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,French soccer HQ raided in Swiss case against Sepp Blatter,"['Est March', 'A M']","Swiss authorities say that have seized evidence that will be used against former FIFA president Sepp Blatter. USA TODAY Sports

GENEVA (AP)  Swiss authorities say evidence has been seized in a search at the French soccer federation headquarters for their criminal case against former FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

The office of Switzerland's attorney general on Wednesday said the governing body for French soccer consented to the search carried out Tuesday with the cooperation of the French Financial Prosecution Office.

Criminal proceedings were opened against Blatter last September for suspected financial mismanagement over a $2 million payment he approved from FIFA funds for Michel Platini in 2011.

""Documents were seized in connection with the suspected payment,"" the Swiss federal prosecution office said in a statement, which detailed a formal request for help from French authorities on Jan. 14.

Blatter and Platini were both banned from soccer for six years after an investigation by FIFA's ethics committee. They are appealing against their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Both men have constantly denied wrongdoing and claimed they had a verbal deal for additional salary that former France great Platini would receive for working as Blatter's presidential adviser from 1999-2002.

Before the payment was revealed in September, Platini had been the leading candidate to succeed Blatter as president in FIFA's emergency election on Feb. 26

The payment emerged during a wider investigation led by Switzerland's attorney general, Michael Lauber, of FIFA business. The investigation includes suspected money laundering in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests.

Platini's status in the Swiss investigation is ""between a witness and an accused person,"" Lauber has said.

The case against Blatter also involves alleged misappropriation of FIFA funds during his more than 17 years as FIFA president, which formally ended two weeks ago.

He allegedly arranged an undervalued deal for 2010-2014 World Cup broadcast rights for the Caribbean with former FIFA vice president Jack Warner.

Platini has previously said he asked Blatter for a salary of 1 million Swiss francs when approached in 1998 to work for the newly-elected president.

Blatter said there was a contract for 300,000 Swiss francs, the same as FIFA's then secretary general in line with its salary structure, plus a ""gentleman's agreement"" to get the rest later.

Swiss law obliged FIFA only to pay the deferred money within five years. It was not until 2010 that Platini, by then president of the governing body for European football and a FIFA vice president, reportedly asked for the balance, and was paid in February 2011.

That timing has raised suspicion as the payment came during a FIFA presidential election campaign. UEFA later urged its members to support Blatter  who promised them it would be his final term  against Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar.

Blatter won that 2011 election unopposed after Bin Hammam was implicated in bribing Caribbean voters. From then on, Platini was the likely successor to lead FIFA.

Instead, Platini's long-time right-hand man at UEFA, general secretary Gianni Infantino, won the FIFA presidential election last month.

Airport passeners. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

Recently, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure considered the AIRR Act, legislation with a controversial provision that would spin off the nations air traffic control (ATC) system to a private corporation, run by a 13-person, industry-dominated board. I led the opposition to this controversial proposal.

When considering changes to the most complex ATC system in the world, safety must be our No. 1 priority. Unfortunately, the AIRR Act would jeopardize safety by splitting the FAA in two and leaving safety programs and more than 7,400 FAA safety employees vulnerable to congressional budget cuts and shutdowns. It also would sever ties between the Department of Defense and the ATC system, which have protected the American public during national emergencies.

Not only would the AIRR Act jeopardize funding for aviation safety, its a terrible deal for the traveling public. The corporation could pick winners and losers by setting ATC standards without public oversight. The AIRR Act would give the corporation the ability to tax American consumers to pay for the ATC system. The corporation would decide flight routes and could disregard aircraft noise issues. It could also jeopardize access to the aviation system in smaller cities and rural communities. Finally, the AIRR Act would give valuable publicly owned ATC assets to the corporation for free, while leaving taxpayers to bail out the corporation if it cant pay to operate the system.

There is bipartisan agreement that the FAA needs real reform. I offered an amendment that struck the ATC privatization plan and protected our annual $16 billion investment in our aviation system from congressional dysfunction by moving it off the budget. The amendment also mandated reforms of the FAAs personnel and procurement systems. Unfortunately, this amendment was rejected.

The AIRR Act would not fix the real problems plaguing the FAA. Congress should pass targeted solutions  not a risky privatization scheme that puts industry in charge of our aviation system and leaves consumers unprotected.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,5 coolest travel products currently on Kickstarter,"['Special For Usa Today', 'Est March', 'Jelisa Castrodale', 'P M']","There was a time in the not-so-distant past when, if you were shopping for the newest travel gadgets you'd thumb through the latest Sharper Image catalog or see what kind of must-have tech was on display at Brookstone. But now, some of the best and most innovative travel products are found (and funded) on Kickstarter, Indiegogo or other crowdfunding sites. Bluesmart, a ridiculously intelligent suitcase that has built in GPS tracking, a digital lock and a phone charger raised $2.2 million through Indiegogo. Baubax, a feature-heavy travel jacket billed as ""The World's Best"" pulled in a jaw-dropping $9.2 million on Kickstarter.

So what's the next Kickstarter must-have? It could be one of these five products, which are either still looking for backers or are taking pre-orders through the site. There are travel jeans, pocket-sized power strips and hard-case luggage that flattens out and hangs in your hotel closet  the kind of thing that you didn't know you needed, but may not be able to travel without.

1.Lifepack, a solar-powered backpack, launched on Kickstarter on Monday with a modest $20,000 funding goal. It hit that number within eight hours and, as of this writing, has pulled in more than $66,000 from backers. The Lifepack has a solar-powered USB charger, an integrated locking cable (that doubles as a bottle opener) and a portable Bluetooth speaker. There are also four hidden pockets, including a passport-sized pocket in the strap that would allow you to safely conceal your travel documents.

""I tried to put in every kind of feature that fits the digital nomad who is constantly on-the-go,"" Lifepack founder Adrian Solgaard told Road Warrior Voices. ""Really, it's best-suited for people who travel a lot or work remotely.""

Solgaard said that the idea for the Lifepack began with the integrated lock, and features were added from there. ""My friend's backpack was stolen with his laptop and everything inside last year, which is when I really started digging into [the design],"" he said.

Solgaard seems to have designed the Lifepack for people like himself. He said that, as a frequent traveler (""I go wherever the action is,"" he said) he's splitting his time between seven countries on three different continents, living out of one Lifepack and a carry-on suitcase. The Lifepack is available through Kickstarter for $125; it will later retail for $249.

2.The Best Travel Jeans in the World could be a clever name, or it could be the truth. We like that the jeans have a hidden zipper back pocket, which will make a would-be pickpocket's job that much harder, and a fifth pocket that is large enough to accommodate an iPhone 6. There is also a zippered front pocket, which is passport-sized and would be handy as you're shuffling through an airport security line in your sock feet. The jeans  which the designers say are ""as comfy as sweatpants""  are made in Los Angeles and are available in three styles for men and women. You can pick up a pair for a pledge of $98 or more.

3.Neit is a wheeled, waterproof hard-case suitcase (made of durable Polycarbonate and a strong-but-light aluminum frame) that collapses to a slimmer-than-slim three inches when it is empty and not in use. Its carabiner-style handle lets you hang it in the closet of your hotel or on the back of your door, allowing you to maximize every available inch of your tiny European hotel room. Neit also has its own iPhone and Android app, which stores trip information, boarding passes and allows you to track the luggage through its built-in GPS transmitter. Neit is currently available for a pledge of $212 (plus $40 for GPS) and will eventually retail for $450.

Yoga is phenomenal for strength, flexibility and mental clarity - and for easing tight muscles.

Sound good, skiers? You're not alone.

Ski resort yoga classes are the latest trend for winter 2016. Top resorts across the country are offering unique and creative ways to get your Namaste on.

1. Washington School House in Park City, Utah

The Washington School House offers yoga like you've never done it before: on a stand-up paddleboard deep inside a 10,000-year-old crater at The Homestead.

The instructor demonstrates poses from the dock, while you float and bend on a paddleboard bobbing on the 90-degree natural therapeutic pool. (Try a nighttime class - pure heaven).

The ""Oscars so white"" controversy dominated the Academy Awards ceremony last week. But its not just an Oscars problem.

As an African-American tech entrepreneur, I can tell you that racism doesn't just pervade Hollywood. There is a definite parallel between minorities struggling for recognition in entertainment and the struggles of my peers of color in the tech industry. I have experienced it firsthand.

I remember walking into that room. Following weeks of phone conversations, I had finally scored an in-person meeting with the investors that could make it all happen. They had been thoroughly briefed on my idea and their interest in meeting with me held promise.

I was prepared. My suit was perfectly tailored. I had my pitch down and, after years of experience building and launching 10 successful mobile apps, including my latest venture FITBOX, I was fluent in the language of money.

Standing in front of a small group of established businessmen, I took my seat and confidently began my presentation. But one thing dominated the investors' attention and influenced their perception of me: the color of my skin.

Comparisons made throughout the meeting referencing black athletes and entertainers indicated that I was being stereotyped into a specifically black model of success.

I am an African-American male in technology and, despite my success, there is implicit bias that, still today in 2016, I and my peers of similar complexion cannot escape. Perhaps it is due to the lack of iconic African American entrepreneurs, but there is a lack of trust among investors in the entrepreneurial spirit of minorities  even when their companies are clearly investment worthy.

That day I got the typical ""Let's stay in touch and see how it goes."" And then silence. This was the same response I got from investors for my app Songbooth  8 million downloads later, there was still silence.

Barriers to entry

There is a barrier to entry for every tech entrepreneur trying to get funding in todays market. But there are additional walls for African Americans and other minority groups to overcome that too often make it feel impossible to find success in the space. The numbers bear that out. Fewer than 1% of venture capital-backed Internet companies have African American founder, according to a 2010 report by CB Insights.

Equal opportunity is still our dream, but it is not our reality, and bias is perhaps our greatest obstacle along the way. My confidence in my ideas is often perceived as arrogance. Tailored suits and nice clothing draw comparisons to what society defines as typical ""black"" models of success  hip-hop moguls and professional athletes  rather than defining success on individual terms.

More often than not, stereotyping is silent, but this doesnt make it any less real or any less palpable for underrepresented minorities in tech.

Success isnt black or white, its an individual accomplishment that comes in many shades of grey  so why in an age where the free world has an African-American leader, do institutions still perpetuate different versions of success based on race? Why is ""black"" success associated with creativity and athleticism, but not with intellect, innovation and business savvy?

From my vantage point, perception is the key driving factor that separates the well funded from the under funded. While white male confidence is perceived as an essential ingredient for success, African Americans with a high confidence level are met with distrust, particularly when it comes to money.

I was eventually able to secure debt-funding and angel funding for Lowekey and FITBOX from Caucasian and African-American investors. I'm still looking to secure venture capital to support FITBOX's growth as a global lifestyle brand.

500 Startups

We are taking steps to move in the right direction. Today, there are multiple programs in place teaching minority youth how to code  giving youth a skill they can use to foster success in the industry. But what does it mean to have these skills if we dont have investors confident enough in these individuals to fund their creative vision?

Big things are beginning to happen. 500 Startups, an investment firm and start-up accelerator, recently announced Monique Woodard as its first African-American venture partner as the firm looks to increase investment in black and Latino founders. This is huge and certainly a step in the right direction, but we need to make this the norm, not the exception, when it comes to venture firms.

Genius is not bound by race, gender, ethnicity or income bracket. So I ask the world this: When will the industry start recognizing African-Americans as the innovators we are?

SAN FRANCISCO  Videos and selfies on Facebook will never be the same.

Facebook is heating up competition with Snapchat with the purchase of Masquerade, which makes imaging software that jazzes up videos and selfies with fun filters, masks and other special effects.

Masquerade is part of Facebook's ongoing push to capture the youth vote by giving users the ability to add filters, text, emojis and stickers to photos and videos. Last year Snapchat rolled out ""lenses,"" animated effects for selfies, through the purchase of Looksery, which made facial modification software. Among the effects: graphics that let you vomit rainbows or turn into a monster.

Masquerade's app MSQRD lets you record video selfie animations that change the way you look to send to friends on messaging apps and social networks. One of Masquerade's popular features is ""face swap,"" which lets people trade faces with one another in photos. The app also lets you take selfies in celebrity masks.

Facebook's purchase underscores the hunt for flashy new features that appeal to younger users amid growing competition for eyeballs among messaging and social apps such as Snapchat and Facebook-owned Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram.

Video promises to be a major revenue driver for Facebook, which is eager to tap into television advertising budgets. Facebook users watch 100 million hours of video on the giant social network every day, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter financial results with analysts in January.

Facebook, whose $3 billion buyout offer was famously spurned by Snapchat in 2013, did not say how much it paid for Masquerade. The technology will be incorporated into Facebook, but the MSQRD app will continue to run independently, according to Masquerade CEO Eugene Nevgen.

""Masquerade has built a fantastic app, MSQRD, with world-class imaging technology for video,"" the Menlo Park, Calif., company said in an emailed statement. ""We're excited to welcome Masquerade to our team and continue enhancing the Facebook video experience.""

Masquerade's key employees including founders Nevgen, Sergey Gonchar and Eugene Zatepyakin will join Facebook's London office.

""Video communication is exploding. At Masquerade, weve worked hard to make video more fun and engaging by creating filters that enhance and alter your appearance. Now, were excited to join forces with Facebook and bring the technology to even more people."" Nevgen wrote in a blog post.

The chain does not currently have a property in Las Vegas.

The food scene in Las Vegas is unrivaled, and the city is justifiably famous for its Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, over the top buffets and expense account indulgences. But it is also one of the best spots to easily try many of Americas trademark regional culinary specialties, a one-stop shop for everything from authentic Maine lobster rolls to New York Citys most famous Jewish deli sandwiches.

Virtually every regionally beloved fast food chain has a Las Vegas outpost. It is the only place in the country where you can choose between cult rivals In-N-Out Burger from the West Coast and Eastern legend White Castle. Californias Fatburger and even Cheeseburger at the Oasis, the mainlands only offshoot of Hawaiis popular Cheeseburger In Paradise group, can be found here, along with newer chains Smashburger, Umami Burger, and most recently, California-born, grass-fed natural patty specialist Burger Lounge, which just opened at Aria.

Its similar for pizza; ever since Wolfgang Puck brought his unique California-style version here with Spago, which kicked off the whole Vegas celebrity chef and imported restaurant brand concept in 1992. You can still try the original smoked salmon version that put California-style pizza on the map, but Spago has been joined by the most authentic New York-style pizza at Di Fara, and real hard to find Detroit-style pizza at Pizza Rock.

The city is so popular with Hawaiian visitors that it is nicknamed The Ninth Island, and there is a surprising amount of authentic Hawaiian cuisine here, hard to find in most other major cities. One of the worlds best known cocktails, the margarita, is synonymous with Mexico, where it was invented at Hussongs Cantina in Ensenada. Hussongs only other locations in the world? In Mandalay Bay and at Boca Park in Summerlin.

Americas best regional foods are still worth trying at their source, and there is something more special about having a lobster roll at a picnic table on the rocky and rugged Maine coast than at the food court in Planet Hollywoods Miracle Mile Shops, but if you cannot get to Maine or Hawaii this is the next best thing. And there is no other place in the world where you can have a slider from the folks who invented it and a margarita from the folks who invented it in the same day.

Protesters hold a pinata of Donald Trump in Chicago in 2015. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)

Businessman Donald Trump has made calls for deporting the roughly 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the USA a staple of his campaign. And recently Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is emerging as Trump's leading rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has jumped on board the deportation train, saying he too would remove them all.

Mass deportation is a popular position among many voters in the GOP primaries and caucuses. But the concept is so unworkable that it's a wonder anyone takes the idea very seriously. Because Trump and Cruz have said so little about how they'd accomplish this pledge, a case can be made that it's little more than a way to court people unhappy with America's changing demographics.

Any president who tried to deport 11 million people, the equivalent of emptying out the state of Ohio, would face immediate practical and political problems. Some 60% of todays undocumented workers have been in the USA for 10 years or more. They have been integrated into their communities.

What's more, 3.5 million of the undocumented immigrants who have been here at least six years (and could therefore receive leniency under an Obama administration executive order being disputed in court) have children who are U.S. citizens. Removing them would involve splitting up families or sending kids to what  to them  are foreign countries.

Locating millions of immigrants for deportation would take a very dramatic increase in domestic surveillance and enforcement, including door-to-door roundups. Mistakes would inevitably be made, with legal immigrants and citizens swept up in the process. Courts that handle immigration cases would be overwhelmed.

Mass deportations would also harm the economy. Most undocumented workers are in relatively low-skilled jobs, but about a quarter are in white-collar jobs. Of those, about half are in management, finance or professional careers. Removing large numbers would have a very significant impact on the businesses that employ them. Undocumented workers make up about 5.1% of the American workforce at a time when a 4.9% unemployment rate shows that labor markets are growing tight.

Although mass deportation might play well in Republican primaries, the idea would be a much tougher sell in a general election. Roughly two-thirds of respondents to a Gallup poll said they favored giving undocumented workers a chance to normalize their status. In the 2012 election, GOP candidate Mitt Romney, who had merely suggested that illegal immigrants ""self deport,"" received just 27% of the Hispanic vote, effectively dooming his chances.

Yes, the law should have meaning, and tough border enforcement should be coupled with an arduous path to legality for anyone already here. In fact, the Obama administration has deported not insignificant numbers, mostly of people apprehended along the border.

In 2013, the most recent year for which there are data, 438,000 were sent home. President Obama has received some blowback for these deportations. The opposition would grow considerably if his successor tried to greatly increase that number, and to draw from the ranks of those firmly rooted in American communities.

For these reasons, campaign talk of deporting 11 million should be taken with extreme skepticism. Trump, in fact, has hinted about flexibility on his immigration positions, raising the possibility that his extreme position represents an opening bid. If that's the case, he should come out and say so.

One reason Trump and Cruz are doing so well is that voters are tired of establishment politicians who don't keep their promises. On deportation, the front-runners are making a promise they know they won't be able to deliver on.

Mitt Romney huffed, and John McCain puffed, and for one surreal Thursday night it seemed as if Donald Trump might self-immolate before an aroused GOP establishment could unleash its full fury on his insurrectionist campaign. By the weekend, when he beat Ted Cruz only narrowly in Kentucky and Louisiana and lost outright in Kansas and Maine, it looked as if the counterrevolution might be coming to life.

False alarm.

The establishment's roar turned out to be more of a whine. The jokes about the front-runner's you-know-what grew stale. And when the votes in Michigan and Mississippi had been tallied, the Trump campaign staggered on, moving that much closer to a convention coronation that seemed unthinkable just six months ago.

It wasn't supposed to be this way. Michigan was supposed to be the state where grown-ups drew their line in the sand, the place where Republicans who sent Jerry Ford to Washington and Rick Snyder to Lansing told the bloviating charlatan from New York to sit down and shut up before he ruined the Party of Lincoln for everyone.

But it was the establishment's bluster, not Trump's, that proved hollow. Trump parried Romney's frontal assault with a four-year-old video in which the party's 2012 nominee heaped fulsome praise on Trump's judgment and financial acumen. Marco Rubio, an early favorite to carry the Anyone-But-Trump banner into the second half of the primaries, was sinking like a stone, struggling to stay in double digits.

On Tuesday, the bad news for Trump's rivals began early and accumulated steadily as the polls closed from east to west. In Mississippi, where more than two thirds of Republican primary voters identify themselves as evangelicals, Ted Cruz never came within hailing interest of the Manhattan billionaire who made Two Corinthians famous.

In Michigan, not even an open primary that gave Democrats the opportunity to kibbitz on the Republicans' choice could blunt Trump's momentum. He led by comfortable margins in the populist southeastern counties as well as the conservative hinterland.

Tuesday night's victory put Trump only incrementally closer to sewing up the nomination. If Rubio and John Kasich manage to rescue wins in their native states next week, the GOP race could remain muddled until June 7 and beyond.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

But the pattern that was perpetuated Tuesday  Trump in first place, an ever-shifting flavor of the week in second  makes it increasingly unlikely that any of Trump's rivals will be able to block Trump's path, much less overtake him. In the states beyond Michigan, the ""race within the race"" is increasingly a bore.

For two months now, Trump has consistently claimed that rumors of his demise were premature. After Tuesday's wins in Michigan and Mississippi, it may be time to concede that there was never any substance to them in the first place.

Lets see whos hot, and whos not.

Whos hot

Is anyone filling up a box score better than Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo? In his last five games, The Greek Freak is averaging 21 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 2.8 steals and 2.0 blocks per contest. Hes one of the games only legitimate five-category contributors.

Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker is so hot the only thing missing from his game is NBA Jam-style flame trails. In four games this month, Walker is posting 30.8 points, 6.8 assists and 5.5 rebounds, all while shooting a robust 54.1% from the field and 51.7% from three-point range. Boomshakalaka.

He has flashed talent before, but Phoenix Suns center Alex Len is finally getting a steady run and producing big-time numbers, particularly on the glass. In his last five games, Len is putting up 20.4 points, 14.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. Unlike the first two guys on this list he could still be available in your league. If he is, get him.

Since joining the Miami Heat, forward Joe Johnson is posting 14 points per night on a judicious 60.4% shooting  that includes 8-for-12 (66.7%) from downtown. Johnsons accuracy and scoring offers some sneaky value in larger leagues.

Whos not

Maybe Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love was the subject of LBJs latest round of cryptic tweets. The former All-Star is shooting a woeful 30.3% (15% from three) over his last six games, accounting for just 12.8 points and 6.5 boards per in that span.

It has been a rough start to March for Detroit Pistons forward Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who is hitting on just 25.8% of his shots and 11.1% of his three pointers thus far. After looking like a player on the rise in January, Caldwell-Pope isnt doing fantasy teams any favors right now.

Indiana Pacers forward Myles Turner appeared on the hot side not that long ago, but the rookie looks like he may be hitting the wall. In 28 minutes of action, Turner is managing a paltry 7.5 points and 5.3 rebounds while shooting just 31.5% over his last six. Keep him sidelined.

I know San Antonio is saving some bullets for the playoffs, but Spurs guard Tony Parker is taking it a little too far right now: 5.0 PPG, 5.3 APG, 2.3 RPG in March. Add to that 33.3% shooting and zero made threes and only those in deep leagues should consider riding this out.",[]
usatoday.com,2012-03-25 00:00:00,"Should class attendance be mandatory? Students, professors say no","['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Rachel Osman', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Mandatory attendance in college has always been a highly debated subject.

Professors want students to attend all of their classes so they can teach them directly, but many students want to be given the freedom to decide which classes to attend. Due to the difficulty of regulating a school-wide attendance policy, most colleges and universities give professors the authority to set their own attendance rules.

Sam Artley, a senior studying social relations and policy at Michigan State University, said she does not agree with mandatory attendance policies except in the case of lab work because it is usually completed in class with very little work outside of the classroom.

Artley noted that many professors say regular attendance is necessary to do well in a course and agrees that attendance and course performance are positively correlated.

That being said, there would be no need for mandatory attendance as students seeking high grades will quickly learn that they need to attend the course regularly, she said. Inflating grades with 10-20 percent of your score coming from attendance is a poor judgment of an individuals competency in the course.

Professor Kelli Marshall teaches media and film classes at DePaul University and does not implement a mandatory attendance policy. Instead, she gives her students the opportunity to earn participation points via weekly quizzes and discussion questions.

Since most students want to earn their participation points, they generally come to class, even though attendance is not mandatory, Marshall said.

This policy works well for Marshall and saves her a lot of time and hassle.

Its beneficial to me because I dont have to worry about marking whos there, whos not, whos late, who leaves early, she said. Additionally, I dont have to haggle with students over any grades associated with excused and unexcused absences.

While Marshalls non-mandatory attendance policy makes her job easier, shes not sure if it is beneficial to her students.

I would hope it is since it suggests Im treating them as adults, she said.

A common argument brought up by students regarding mandatory attendance is that, as tuition payers, they shouldnt be punished for missing something they are paying for anyway.

As students paying to enroll in these courses, the attendance should be up to us and not roped into course grading in any way shape or form, Artley said.

An additional aspect of mandatory attendance that must be taken into consideration is the possible distraction caused by students who show up to class only to earn points yet distract other students as they do everything under the sun except listen to the professor. For instance, it is not uncommon to go into a college lecture and see many students doing one of the following: sleeping, Facebook chatting, online shopping, watching funny animal videos on YouTube, streaming live sporting events (boys) and pinning wedding dresses on Pinterest (girls).

Sarah Griffin, a sophomore at Indiana University, does not believe professors should allow students to get away with missing a large number of classes. However, she also thinks a policy that requires attendance to every class is too limiting. Instead, Griffin thinks professors should have mandatory attendance with a few absences allowed.

I dont think attendance should be mandatory unless a few free days are provided, because I think by the university level, students have the right and responsibility to prioritize their own time, Griffin said. I think it would be unfair for a student to be penalized if they, for instance, chose to forgo a lecture in favor of working on a semester project.

Griffin said most of her professors either dont have an attendance policy or, if one is in place, students are allowed to miss a certain number of days in the semester without being penalized.

I think this is preferable to a more strict attendance policy, as it allows students appropriate control of their own schedules, she said.

While Griffin does not mind professors who have attendance requirements, she recognizes that not all of her peers share her opinion. She said she tries to regularly attend her classes to learn from the lectures, but she knows there are many students who do not share her learning style and would prefer to learn the material on their own.

For them, a strict attendance policy seems detrimental, she said.

In the end, Griffin believes attendance policies must balance both sides and find a happy medium.

Were adults, but still college students at the same time, Griffin said. Universities should have some regulation, but we should be primarily responsible for our own education and I think attendance policies should reflect that.",[]

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,5 movies to watch when staying home for spring break,"['Natasha Jones', 'The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Spring break at home can seem like a bummer, but it doesnt have to mean you cant get away. With this list of movies  filmed or set in vacation destinations  youll get feel like youve traveled far without the hassle of airports but with the very delicious homemade meals youve been missing out on. All in all, a pretty good deal. Here, five films to watch this break:

1. 50 First Dates

This 2004, Hawaii-based rom-com tells the story of Henry (Adam Sandler), a man who romances tourists because it it keeps him from making a commitment.

That changes when he meets a local girl named Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a cafe; the two have a strong connection from the get-go. The only problem? The next day, Henry realizes Lucy has absolutely no memory of meeting him. So when the cafe owner tells Henry an accident has resulted in her having no short-term memory, Henry makes it his mission to make Lucy fall in love with him again every single day.

Mush together this hilarious duo, a great soundtrack from artists like the Beach Boys and the gorgeous Hawaii scenery and youll feel like youve been airlifted to an island where nothing matters but the love.

2. Why Did I get Married?

Four married couples who have been friends since college take a yearly retreat to ask, Why did I get married? in this 2007 Tyler Perry movie. The group travels to the snowy mountains of Colorado where a number of issues  think infidelity, deception and anger  cause chaos among the eight friends.

Theres two things going for this one: The dramas so scandalous youll either be relieved youre single, or that you have a break from your significant other. Plus itll seem like youve gotten in the last gasp of ski season thanks to the spectacular snowy sites.

3. Were the Millers

When a drug dealer gets robbed of his stash  some of which he owed his drug lord  he finds himself in a dangerous situation. Naturally, he travels to Mexico in this 2013 movie to smuggle marijuana over the border to repay what is owed. (Wouldnt you?) But he has to make the trip look normal.

So, the dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis), cons a stripper (Jennifer Aniston, because she seems like the stripper type) to pose as his wife, as well as a petty thief and his teenager neighbor to pose as their children. Together, theyre just a happy family on vacation.

If you wanted a road trip, you get a road trip  and this one has comedy.

4. The Holiday

Split between California and England, this 2006 movie is about two women, played by Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet, who, on separate sides of the pond, discover their significant others cheated on them. To recuperate, they seek an escape for the holidays, and a desire for a change of scenery leads them to a website that allows the two of them to swap homes for two weeks.

Both women end up meeting people from the others life who give them new perspectives and challenges  plus, they a few new friends  along the way. The star-studded cast also includes Jack Black and Jude Law, so theres that, but the rom-com will also open your eyes to the possibilities around you, vacation or not.

5. Leap Year

This 2010 film follows Anna (the awesome Amy Adams), who grows tired of waiting for her boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott, so, so far, so good), to take the next step in their relationship and propose. She decides to take part in the Irish tradition of a female proposing to a man on Leap Day and so travels from Boston to Dublin, where her boyfriend is staying for a conference.

When bad weather derails her travel plans, she crosses paths with Decla (Matthew Goode). From the outset, the two clash and bicker, but end up traveling together to Dublin. Despite a tumultuous journey, romance stirs between them  leaving Anna with a very confusing decision after her boyfriend proposes to her.

Grassy cliffs, shorelines and witty banter are just a few of the things this film has to offer. Youll get the feel of a vacation, alongside a cute love story, too.

The former tight end who now appears on the Redskins Radio Broadcast and co-hosts a show on ESPN 980 said that Griffin hated Cousins from the moment he was drafted  something that never got better through their years in Washington together.

Via the Washington Post:

Robert was never willing to be friends with Kirk Cousins, Cooley said. They never hung out together, they never spent time together, their families didnt hang out together. ... It was never a great relationship. I dont think Robert ever wanted it to be a great relationship. And I think it became really contentious over the last two years, to where Rex Grossman, a guy who Im close with, said This is weird in here. This is a bad situation in here. These guys dont like each other.

He added that other members of the offense didnt like Griffin, from receivers to the offensive line.

Again, via the Washington Post:

The offensive line did not like Robert Griffin, Cooley said. A lot of the receivers did not like Robert Griffin. The offensive line had a problem with Robert, because they were considered for a year-and-a-half or two years a terrible offensive line that couldnt protect a quarterback. A lot of that isnt true. A lot of that was Robert. A lot of the sacks were put on Robert. Want to believe it or not, they were, okay? Football-wise, they were: it was Robert.

Whether that was true or not  a few Redskins players took to Twitter to express what appears to be their thoughts on Cooleys claims.

Brian Orakpo, an outside linebacker who was on the Redskins for 6 seasons until heading to the Titans in 2015:

And Niles Paul, Redskins tight end:

On ESPN, Ryan Clark, who played his last season in the NFL on the Redskins in 2014 dismissed Cooleys claims. First of all, like that dude, anything he says I dont necessarily pay attention to, he said, before adding later that Griffin and his teammates dont need to be friends.

Good for you, Ben. May all top recruits follow in your path. The arrangement between the NCAA and NBA that forces you to spend one year in college is unethical and disgraceful. You were right to make a mockery of it.

Simmons wont be up for The Wooden Award because he failed to maintain a 2.0 GPA. So, despite being eligible to continue playing NCAA basketball hes no longer up for an award given to The Player of the Year. Because the Wooden Award, named for former UCLA coach John Wooden, is more than that, you see. Head to the website and youll be greeted by one of the many sanctimonious quotes that has been used to burnish Woodens image:

What you are as a person is far more important than what you are as a basketball player.

As a person, Wooden was, in addition to being the wise mentor everyone says he was, a cheater and a liar who allowed a booster to break rules so that UCLA could recruit and keep players (something that you could say about so many top college coaches through the years). As a basketball coach, he has few peers.

Simmons is 19-years-old, stands 6-foot-10 and has shocking athleticism. He has the chance to be an All-Star in the NBA  a league in which 77 players will make at least $10 million this year  for the next decade and a half. The only thing Ben Simmons needs to care about right now is playing basketball. If he does it well hell make enough money to keep his family secure for generations.

But because the NCAA needs its revenue-driving basketball tournament to include the top young talent in the world and because NBA owners are loathe to pay out big contracts to young players who may not work out or could take years to develop, Simmons was forced onto campus for a year. Heres how he described his time to USA TODAY:

I was just trying to be a college student, but its not easy for me just because who I am, he said. So I just tried to enjoy little things. Enjoyed it really, learning new things with people. Simmons, who started with summer courses, said one of his favorites was a Communications course. I loved my Communications class, he said. The toughest one I had was Oceanography only because I didnt have too much interest in the oceans. But I love it here. I went to summer school. I definitely love walking around the campus. I love LSU.

This is perfect. This is real. Walking around campus ... pretty great. Little things ... we should all stop to appreciate them. Pretending to care about Oceanography ... waste of time. Youre right Ben. Youre so right.

I feel bad for any professors, tutors or advisors who were forced to participate in this charade. But lets be clear: this is entirely held up by the NBA. Simmons is not at fault. Hes just navigating a system, and deftly so. The Wooden Award is meaningless; an ode to a bygone era and a system built to restrict the opportunities of the top basketball players at the behest of behemoth business interests.

Simmons did the right thing  as a person  by focusing on becoming a better player and teammate. Which is probably what Wooden the coach would have wanted anyway.",[]

A total eclipse of the sun will turn day into night over portions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

Indonesia will get the best view Wednesday, especially in central portions of Borneo and Sumatra. Most of the solar eclipse will be over the open ocean of the Pacific.

A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets in the way of the sun, casting its shadow on the Earth's surface.

A partial solar eclipse, when only some of the sun is covered up, will be visible in many other areas, including China, the Koreas, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and portions of Hawaii.

In Honolulu, 63% of the sun will be covered, according to Sky and Telescope, but because of the International Date Line, Hawaiians will see the event Tuesday afternoon. The maximum eclipse will occur about an hour before sunset at 5:37 p.m. local time Tuesday.

This is the first of two solar eclipses this year, according to NASA. The other will be an ""annular"" solar eclipse over Africa on Sept. 1. An annular eclipse is one in which the edge of the sun is still visible as a bright ring around the moon.

Folks in the U.S. will have to wait until Aug. 21, 2017, to see the next total solar eclipse. That one will be seen in the Southeast, the Central Plains and the Northwest.

There will be two lunar eclipses this year, on March 23 and Sept. 16, NASA reports. Only the March 23 eclipse will be visible in North America.

Both will be less-spectacular ""penumbral"" lunar eclipses, when the moon is in Earths faint outer (penumbral) shadow. These types of lunar eclipses can almost pass unnoticed.

The last Broncos quarterback to start a game not named Peyton Manning or Brock Osweiler (17)? Tim Tebow. (Photo: Justin Edmonds, Getty Images)

The Super Bowl champions are suddenly starving for a quarterback.

With Brock Osweiler agreeing to a contract with the Houston Texans on Wednesday, two days after Peyton Manning announced his retirement, Denver Broncos general manager John Elway finds himself having to replace not just one but two quarterbacks.

The Broncos had made re-signing Osweiler a top priority, though that became more difficult after the team placed the franchise tag on outside linebacker and Super Bowl MVP Von Miller earlier this month. Negotiations between the team and Osweilers representatives were quiet until Wednesday morning, a person with knowledge of the talks told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke under condition of anonymity because the Texans have not announced Osweilers deal.

By Wednesday afternoon, it had become clear to the Broncos that Osweilers preference was to leave, especially given the financial consideration. Osweilers four-year deal in Houston is worth $72 million, according to multiple reports.

The Broncos were never willing to pay Osweiler that much.

Weve stayed true to our philosophy of building a team with players who want to be Denver Broncos and want to be here. Thats been a successful approach for us,"" Elway said in a statement.

""While we did offer a very competitive and fair long-term contract to Brock, we ultimately had to remain disciplined while continuing to assemble a roster that can compete for championships.""

This is a rare time in his five years as general manager that Elway hasnt been able to close the deal on a player he truly wanted. In the past, hes landed top free agents like pass rusher DeMarcus Ware, wide receiver Wes Welker and cornerback Aqib Talib. But Elway also has proven in some cases  think Elvis Dumervil in 2013, or left tackle Joe Thomas, whom the Cleveland Browns were willing to trade last year  that he will walk away when the cost becomes too high.

Still, this situation had the highest of stakes. Now the Broncos will begin their Super Bowl defense with a new quarterback. Elway surely has been considering backup plans in recent days, and now hell have to quickly put one into action.

One option is San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has reportedly requested a trade. Elway has worked with Niners general manager Trent Baalke before, including a draft-day trade in 2011 went Elway sent San Francisco the pick the 49ers used to select Kaepnerick in the second round.

Ryan Fitzpatrick and Robert Griffin III are the most prominent quarterbacks available in the free agent market.

Winning Super Bowl 50 means the Broncos will pick last (31st) in the first round of April's draft.

Coach Gary Kubiaks offense is designed to rely on the running game, with a heavy emphasis on play-action in the passing game. Kubiak prefers his quarterback take most of snaps from under center and wants him to be mobile enough to move the pocket and execute bootleg plays. Elway typically looks for quarterbacks with prototypical size and big arms.

One player on the roster has volunteered to fill the void, with kicker Brandon McManus tweeting Wednesday: ""I know it is free agency and I KICK footballs for a living but I can definitely THROW the pigskin pretty far #justsaying.""

But whichver passer eventually lands in Denver, he will join a team that should continue to have one of the NFLs best defenses  despite the free agent departures of defensive end Malik Jackson and linebacker Danny Trevathan  and Elway said multiple times during the Broncos postseason run that he believed by building around his defense, he could set Denver up for long-term success, regardless of who is under center.

Hes about to put that philosophy to the ultimate test, as the Broncos become the first team since the 2000 Baltimore Ravens to lose their top two quarterbacks after winning a Super Bowl.

Former first lady Nancy Reagan, the former actress who played a pivotal role in the political rise and presidency of husband Ronald Reagan, died Sunday of congestive heart failure at the age of 94, the Reagan library announced.

She will be buried next to her husband, former President Ronald Reagan, at his presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif.

""Prior to the funeral service, there will be an opportunity for members of the public to pay their respects at the Library,"" its statement said. ""Details will be announced shortly.""

Tributes to Mrs. Reagan poured in from across the political spectrum.

""Our former first lady redefined the role in her time here,"" President Obama said in a statement. ""Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimers, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.""

Obama noted that Mrs. Reagan once wrote, correctly, that nothing can prepare you for living in the White House  but he and current first lady Michelle Obama ""had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice.""

Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that, ""with the passing of Nancy Reagan, we say a final goodbye to the days of Ronald Reagan. With charm, grace, and a passion for America, this couple reminded us of the greatness and the endurance of the American experiment.""

Barbara Bush, Mrs. Reagan's successor as first lady, said she ""was totally devoted to President Reagan, and we take comfort that they will be reunited once more.""

Former President George W. Bush said that, during her eight years in the White House, Mrs. Reagan ""raised awareness about drug abuse and breast cancer."" Bush added that when he and wife Laura moved into the White House in 2001, ""we benefited from her work to make those historic rooms beautiful.""

The former first lady died of congestive heart failure.

Ex-President Bill Clinton, who issued a statement along with wife and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, described Mrs. Reagan's strength of character as ""legendary, particularly when tested by the attempted assassination of the President, and throughout his battle with Alzheimer's.""

Jimmy Carter, the former president who lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan, said that Mrs. Reagan's ""Just Say No"" program ""prevented many young people from falling prey to the allure of drug use.""

The 2016 Republican presidential candidates also praised the former first lady.

Donald Trump called Mrs. Reagan ""the wife of a truly great President"" and ""an amazing woman"" who will be missed, while Ted Cruz said she will be ""remembered for her deep passion for this nation and love for her husband.."" John Kasich described the Reagans' marriage as ""one of our nation's great love stories and a model of shared devotion to our country,"" while Marco Rubio called the former first lady ""a true example of integrity and grace.""

A Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, said that ""you didn't have to be a Reagan Republican to admire and respect Nancy Reagan."" He called her a tower of strength who had strong beliefs and ""was not afraid to chart her own course politically,"" including support for the Brady gun control law.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., citing President Reagan's late-in-life battle with Alzheimer's, praised Nancy Reagan for her support of stem-called research, ""channeling her family's private struggle into public advocacy on behalf of the millions of Americans fighting this disease.""

Long-time aide Michael Deaver, who died in 2007, once said that, without Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan.""

The former president died in 2004.

""Hands intertwined, Nancy and Ron rose to the pinnacle of political power, weathered cancer and personal heartbreak, and braved the depths of Alzheimer's cold embrace -- always together,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Ky.

Born Anne Frances Robbins on July 6, 1921  and given the name Nancy by her mother  Mrs. Reagan's father left the family when she was young. Her mother, Edith Luckett Robbins, toured the country as an actress. She later married Dr. Loyal Davis, and the family settled in Chicago.

Having caught the acting bug from her mother, young Nancy pursued the profession in New York and Hollywood, where she met with fellow actor Ronald Reagan.

The two married on March 4, 1952.

The former Nancy Davis made 11 films in all, her last one coming in 1956: Hellcats of the Navy, co-starring her husband.

After her husband's election as governor of California in 1966, Mrs. Reagan began projects to assist wounded Vietnam veterans, prisoners of war, and service members missing in action. As first lady of the United States, Mrs. Reagan made drug abuse a central focus for her ""Just Say No"" program.

The library said that Mrs. Reagan is survived by her brother, Dr. Richard Davis; her two children with Ronald Reagan  Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan  and her stepson, Michael Reagan, as well numerous nieces and nephews.

In lieu of flowers, Mrs. Reagan had requested that memorial contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation, the announcement said.

The crumbling of a long-dominant political order in the face of a populist assault can be a riveting spectacle. And as savvy television executives have learned, it can also make for excellent ratings, whether that class conflict occurs on cable networks covering the 2016 presidential campaign  or on public television, chronicling a fading British aristocracy on weekly episodes of the just-concluded series Downton Abbey.

There are striking parallels between the dramatic technological, economic and cultural changes that have upended our election season and the similarly wrenching upheaval that the Crawley family and their servants confront in early 20th century England. Think of Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, the scions of this countrys two most recent political dynasties, as a modern-day version of Lord and Lady Grantham, attempting to come to terms with a disorientingly different era than the one in which they came to power.

When we met Lord Grantham, he was a proud and unchallenged heir of a family that had ruled the surrounding communities for generations. Over the years, he struggled to understand and adapt to the rapidly shifting rules of his society, reacting first with dismissal and then defiance. When he realized that the challenges to his birthright could not be prevented, he became petulant and resentful, before arriving at a grudging and ultimately graceful acceptance. It can be argued that such was the arc of Jebs presidential campaign.

Lady Grantham was not altogether comfortable in this new world, either. But like Hillary Clinton in a reconfigured Democratic Party, she gamely made the effort to adjust to the new reality, and both women have arguably been more successful in making that transition than the male leaders of their respective households. Other, less adaptive guardians of the old order have been reduced to a Greek chorus, alternately warning of the dangers of dramatic change and trying to fathom what those changes represent. When an aging political commentator attempts to make sense of the impact of social media on the campaign debate, it recalls nothing less than Violet, the dowager countess, asking whether a newly installed telephone is ""an instrument of communication or torture.

Lady Mary and Lady Edith are the Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz of Downton, generational colleagues whose mutual distaste for each other masks the similarities of their ambitions to succeed in their rapidly changing world. Mary and Marco are the favorites of their elders, so both are more willing to work within the system to make it function more effectively. Edith and Ted are outcasts and therefore aspire to force more radical change from the outside. (John Kasich, like the dearly departed Lady Sybil, might be simply too nice a person for the scheming and maneuvering that are required to succeed in this landscape.)

Daisy, the estates kitchen maid, convincingly channels Bernie Sanders platform on income inequality and social injustice. She strongly resents the advantages that have been given to others by virtue of their birth station, but she has also learned that direct attacks on the establishment dont lead to her desired outcomes. More experienced and calmer colleagues have helped her understand that all wealthy people are not inherently evil, and that cooperation rather than class-based confrontation can often produce better results. Its yet to be seen whether Sanders will learn these lessons before his own show is canceled.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Finally, there is Donald Trump, for whom there might be lessons in the path of the once nefarious footman Mr. Barrow. For most of his career, Barrow saw success as a zero-sum game, assuming that he could move forward only if others failed. He devoted great time and effort to disparaging and sabotaging the accomplishments of others, often in a particularly mean-spirited and venal way. (Just as we were first introduced to Barrow when he conspires to knock away the cane of a handicapped colleague in order to publicly humiliate him, an equally distasteful moment on the campaign trail was Trumps mocking of a journalists physical disability last fall.)

As a result, Barrow advanced professionally in his chosen field, but he ultimately realized that the price he paid for his bullying and cruelty was a life of anger, unhappiness and resentment. It took strenuous effort for him to overcome the contempt that many of his contemporaries felt for him. It's unlikely that Trump will make a similar adjustment in his behavior. But thats why many of us turn our attention away from the campaign trail for a weekly dose of immersive fiction  so we can at least occasionally watch a happy ending.

Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and a former communications strategist for John McCain and other Republicans, will miss Downton Abbey.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)  As testimony in Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media grew extremely explicit Tuesday, an attorney offered evidence that Hogan has publicly discussed sex and other intimate details about his life over the course of many years.

The testimony included detailed references to Hogan's sex life and sexual parts. In one audio clip from the Bubba The Love Sponge Show, the DJ and Hogan discussed the length of Hogan's penis.

Hogan, whose given name is Terry Bollea, said that he did these interviews and media spots in the persona of his Hulk Hogan character, and not as he is in real life.

The morning testimony elicited Hogan's take on his famous public image versus his private life  at times, a discourse on celebrity culture and identity.

Attorney Michael Sullivan asked Hogan if he was embarrassed by some of the media appearances, pointing to a clip on the Hogan Knows Best reality show. In that snippet shown for the jury, Hogan sat on the toilet, his pants around his ankles, talking to his then-wife on the phone.

Hogan said no, he wasn't embarrassed.

""It's part of the show, it's part of the good and bad of being an entertainer.""

Hogan also said he didn't have a problem with news outlets discussing or even writing about the sex tape.

It was only when Gawker broadcast an edited clip of the actual video that he said he began to suffer.

""I never had a problem with the article. My problem is the videotape. It's on the Internet. It lives forever,""Hogan said.

He also acknowledged he has little privacy as Hulk Hogan, with people taking photos of him everywhere, including once in a urinal at a baseball game.

Hogan and his attorneys are suing Gawker for $100 million, saying that his privacy was violated, that he suffered emotional distress and that the video was not something of legitimate public interest.

Although the trial has been chock-full of salacious details  an interview on Tuesday mentioned Hogan's""thong-shaped tan line"" that was visible in the video  it's also a serious First Amendment case. The core issue: Did Gawker have the right to post one minute and 41 seconds of the sex tape, approximately nine seconds of it actual sexual content?

Gawker says the publication was a legitimate scoop because Hogan had talked openly about his sex life before, in forums such as Howard Stern's radio show. The jury may have to grapple with questions about how celebrity affects expectations of privacy.

Hogan attained pro wrestling stardom in the 1980s and 1990s, winning multiple championships. He also became a celebrity outside his ""Hulkamania"" fan base, appearing in movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, ""Hogan Knows Best.""

As Hogan's testified, he schooled the jury on wrestling history, telling them of being poor, sleeping in his car while performing in small-town matches across the South and finally getting his break when he was asked to appear in the Rocky III movie.

Hogan said that when he had sex with his then-best friend's wife  with his friend's blessing  he didn't know the encounter was being taped.",[]

Thats something that cant be taken away from him.

Conor McGregor is not a great UFC fighter, though, nor has he ever been. Thats something that cant be disputed. Not after what happened Saturday night. He was rushed to prominence thanks to his gift for gab and larger-than-life personality, but as the fight showed, he hasnt become a complete fighter yet.

Listen to Nate Diaz, fresh off his impressive second-round submission win over McGregor at UFC 196, sitting with the Fox Sports 1 crew talking about his career journey while also preaching truth about McGregors meteoric rise.

Ive been fighting 12 years as a martial artist, Diaz said. Like, just knowing ... seeing (the UFC) push this guy. That guys a good fighter and everything, but hes where hes at because of the push hes getting, you know what Im saying? Ive put in a lot of work, and there aint no push. So Im gonna take that (expletive) and make it mine, you know what Im saying? I know Im a better fighter than him. They werent gonna give me no full camp for this guy. Theyre gonna try to do whatever they can to bring him back to the top. I knew I was better than him. ...

Ive been in this UFC since I was 21 years old. I think that was my 25th fight, or 26th fight. Theres no experience like that. That guy, I think this mightve been his sixth, seventh, eighth fight. But well see where hes at in 26 fights from now.

Notice that Diaz called McGregor a good fighter? Thats as far as he could go, because thats all McGregor has been in the UFC: good.

Not great. Not the next big thing worthy of all the hype. Hes a good fighter who basically talked his way to a title shot. From there, it was right place at the right time just like Diaz said.

Consider:

1. McGregor didnt have a signature win in his first five UFC fights before being granted his original featherweight title shot against Jose Aldo. Maybe Dustin Poirier counted as a quality win? Maybe.

2. As McGregor kept winning, the hype train eventually reached full speed because of his trash talk and self-promotion. With his popularity on the rise, the UFC decided to give him a title shot instead of putting him against a top-five fighter first.

3. McGregor did defeat Chad Mendes  ranked ahead of McGregor  by TKO for the interim featherweight title after Aldo pulled out last July. That was hardly a signature win, though, when you consider Mendes took the fight on two weeks notice and how the fight unfolded. Mendes tagged McGregor a bunch and took him down at will in the first round, but it was clear he had no cardio. Mendes gassed out in the second before McGregor finished him. Makes you wonder about the outcome if Mendes had a full camp.

4. McGregor finally did beat Aldo last December at UFC 194  but on a one-punch, 13-second knockout. That was the one-time-out-of-100 ending. Fair or not, the win felt like a case of a lucky punch or Aldo simply getting caught.

The point is that McGregors resume prior to fighting Diaz wasnt all that much to brag about. Now add Saturday nights stunning  or maybe not so stunning  loss and what is McGregor?

Not a great fighter. And certainly not a fighter who had any business declaring himself a god or thinking about taking on Floyd Mayweather. Thats just nonsense.

To his credit, McGregor appeared chastened after the loss and mostly said all the right things. He expressed a desire to defend his 145-pound championship  against Frankie Edgar or in a rematch with Aldo  which is what his priority should be.

He needs to prove that hes better than just good and that hes a champion worth remembering. He rushed there this time, and until he gets there, he can quiet down a little.",[]

No bull lives forever, but thats not to say the bull cant make new highs and climb further in the Wall Street record books. Adam Shell for USA TODAY

It's often said that bull markets dont die of old age. Thats a good thing. Why? Because the current stock market bull, which was born on March 9, 2009, three months before the official end of the Great Recession, celebrates its 7th birthday Wednesday, a long life only two other bulls have enjoyed.

Still, despite the fact the bull sported a 215% gain back in May when the Standard & Poor's 500 index posted its last closing high  which ranks 5th best of all-time, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices -- and has lived a full 84-month life so far -- about two years longer than the average bull market and the third-longest in history -- the aging bull is showing signs of its age.

Time to buy the bull an AARP membership, quips Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

What do you think of 27 companies in S&P 500 reporting no income tax expense last year? #tellusatoday. We may publish replies.  USA TODAY Opinion (@USATOpinion) March 8, 2016

Year seven hasnt been a healthy one for the bull, as the S&P 500 has dipped 4.8% since its 6th birthday and after Tuesday's close of 1979.26 is still hovering below the 2000 level, despite closing above that milestone for the first time in August 2014. And while the large-company U.S. stock index has yet to eclipse the 20% drop required to mark an official end to the bull market and usher in a bear market, it did tumble more than 15% at its intraday low back on Feb. 11 and a large number of companies in the index  212 to be exact  are still down more than 20% from their highs hit since the start of 2015, which means a good chunk of stocks in the index are in bear market territory.

In its prime, the bull racked up some big gains, including a nearly 69% surge in its first year.

The gains, first powered by investors looking to profit from the mega-bounce off the lows after the S&P 500 cratered nearly 57%, were fueled later by the Federal Reserves easy-money policies. The U.S. central bank, starting in 2007, pushed down interest rates and borrowing costs to artificially low levels, giving the economy a much-needed boost and lifting it out of recession. The rock-bottom rates also made stocks a more attractive investment compared to other assets, such as low-yielding government bonds.

A seven-year period of zero interest rates, which the Fed ended back in December with its first rate hike in nearly a decade, led to a feeling on Wall Street that stocks were the best place to park cash for investors looking for a decent return. That viewpoint launched the acronym T.I.N.A. , shorthand for There Is No Alternative to stocks. The bull run was also fueled by corporate Americas massive purchases of its own stock, a buyback boom that created a major source of fresh demand for stocks and made corporate earnings growth look better as profits were spread around fewer outstanding shares.

So where does the aging bull, which is either mature or old, depending on which Wall Street pro you talk to, go from here? Can it make another new all-time closing high and avoid a 20% top-to-bottom decline by the end of May and surpass the second longest-running bull that ended back in August 1956, which lasted 85 and half months?

(One caveat: For this bull market to officially show seven years in the record books, it would have to make a new closing high. If not, and it drops 20% or more into a bear market, the official end of the bull market will be the current peak of May 21, 2015  or just 6 years and two months old, notes Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Should a 20% stumble occur first, this birthday crown will be revoked like Jim Thorpes Olympic medals, Stovall noted in a report. After Tuesday's 1.1% drop, the S&P 500 is currently 7.1% below its record high.)

The current bull, like NHL hockey legend Jaromir Jagr, who is still scoring goals at age 44, could continue to defy skeptics despite graying around its horns, argues Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

This is a stealth bull (that) no one (on Main Street) believes in, Belski says. Why is the bull market not over? Because stocks are slightly lower this year and were flat last year. This is the reset and respite that all bull markets have.

U.S. companies, he adds, are flush with cash and cash flow drives earnings. Whats more, Belski says, the economy is improving despite the fact that many Main Street investors believe a recession is around the corner due to negative stories in the media. The presidential election, he adds, is a bump in the road for stocks.

The bears, of course, keep warning that the end of the bull market is near and that stocks will suffer a steep swoon amid a global economic downturn and the inability of the worlds central bankers to jumpstart growth around the world.

Prominent bears, who were right in 2007, continue to pound the table against this bull, despite being wrong all these years,"" Stovall says.

Sure, price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation metric used by Wall Street, are high relative to long-term averages. But when low inflation and still-low interest rates are factored in, valuations dont seem so inflated, he adds.

The risk, of course, is if the U.S. economy gets dragged into recession, a slip-up that will likely sound the death-knell for the bull market, Stovall warns.

Yes, the bull's best days are probably behind us, Stovall says. However, even though this bull might not be able to sprint toward the setting sun, we think it has the strength to walk toward it.

The deal maxes out at $39 million if Irvin hits Pro Bowl incentives each year.

Irvin, 28, also was believed to have strong interest from the Arizona Cardinals, who faced him twice a year in the NFC West with the Seattle Seahawks since he entered the league in 2012. He has 22 sacks in four seasons.

Abrams calls ""a blood relative"" of the 2008 found-footage monster movie. (Paramount Pictures/Bad Robot)

John Gallagher Jr. received a text message in January from his sister, who was a little mystified.

She asked me, Why didnt you tell me you were part of the Cloverfield movie anthology?'  the actor recalls. I had to tell her, I didnt know. ""

That's surprising, considering that Gallagher stars in the J.J. Abrams-produced 10 Cloverfield Lane, along with John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

But more than a year after shooting the doomsday suspense thriller, none of the actors knew the film's true title until just before the trailer was released in January  a mere two months ahead of the movie's arrival in theaters Friday.

The name instantly forged a direct link to the Abrams-produced 2008 apocalyptic hit Cloverfield.

This kind of intrigue is good for moviegoers accustomed to having too much information about upcoming films, says Abrams.

""Theres fun in discovery,"" Abrams says. ""It's a very rare thing to have the title announced two months before release. It's a strategy we thought wed try. We didnt even bring the cast in on it until the last minute.""

Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman in '10 Cloverfield Lane.' (Photo: Paramount)

Abrams, with his production company Bad Robot, had been looking for a way to revisit Cloverfield, which burst out of nowhere to a devoted following ($80 million in box office) as its Godzilla visibly crushed Manhattan in found footage. He had been unsuccessful in finding a direct successor.

""We have talked about this for years, but never found something exciting enough,"" says Abrams

It was clear to him that the new project, shot under the code name Valencia on an underground bunker set in New Orleans, had ""the same DNA as the first Cloverfield,"" says Abrams. The film, which isn't a direct sequel, purposely wasn't called Cloverfield 2. But it became part of a budding anthology. ""It's the rare major studio release that is an entirely original idea that, at the same time, is connected to a universe that is a larger idea,"" says Abrams.

The parameters of this larger universe haven't been explained to the public. No found footage or giant aliens are visible in 10 Cloverfield Lane's viral trailer. Instead, it shows Winstead and Gallagher's characters living, for unknown reasons, in a bunker with Goodman's increasingly menacing survivalist. The maddening question of what disaster took place is never explained.

""The big question in the movie is 'Whats worse  whats outside or whats inside?' "" says director Dan Trachtenberg. ""I love a story that suggests theres no wall you can build thats high enough, no bunker you can build thats low enough. Bad stuff is going to come. And you just have to be ready for it as a person when it does.""

Will good stuff come to 10 Cloverfield Lane?

Fandango.com managing editor Erik Davis says it was a ""gutsy call"" to invoke the Cloverfield name late in the process. But with a strong social media push and positive word-of-mouth, he predicts Cloverfield Lane will have a solid box-office performance (even if it faces an uphill battle against last week's champ, the animated Zootopia).

Abrams plans more films for this expanding Cloverfield universe.

""This story works entirely as a standalone,"" Abrams says. ""But theres a larger thing were working on that hopefully we get to explore if this connects with people.""

usatoday.com,2016-01-29 00:00:00,The 10 best Carnivals in the Caribbean,"['Mark Rogers', 'Special For Usa Today']","Planning a Caribbean vacation to coincide with one of the regions many Carnivals provides a ton of added value. When Carnival is being celebrated at a Caribbean destination, the whole island hums with energy and good vibes. During a Carnival week, a traveler can still enjoy the gorgeous beaches and tropical scenery  but if they choose, they can take the party levels up to maximum by immersing themselves in Carnival celebrations that are a feast for the senses.

The dates for Carnival shift slightly from year to year, since its keyed to the Lenten Season; Carnival is officially the Monday and Tuesday (called Fat Tuesday) preceding Ash Wednesday. The Big Daddy of all Carnivals is the one in Trinidad, which really blows off the top of the roof. Instead of going head to head in competition with Trinidad, some islands have scheduled their Carnival celebrations at various times of the year. Some of these events can be saucy, while others strive to be more family-friendly.

Trinidad & Tobago

Trinidad rivals Rio and New Orleans Mardis Gras for high-octane Carnival merriment. One of the best things about Trinidad is the option for visitors to join in the fun, don costumes, and dance through the streets of the islands capital, Port-of-Spain. It does take some advance planning, so travelers shouldnt expect to touch down and immediately join a band  which can number in the thousands  and play mas. Similar, but lower key Carnival celebrations, are celebrated on Trinidads sister island, Tobago. When Carnival is done, its cool down time, and weary revelers kick back on Trinidads Maracas Beach and Tobagos Pigeon Point Beach.

Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico celebrates a family-friendly Carnival in the historic city of Ponce, on the islands south coast. The week-long festival culminates on Fat Tuesday. The biggest day is Sunday, when a Grand Parade of costumed dancers wends its way through the city. A highlight is the Vejiantes, colorfully dressed devils with horned paper mache masks and bat wing sleeves. On Tuesday, theres a mock funeral called Entierro de la Sardina, or the Burial of the Sardine.

Aruba

The Dutch island of Aruba kicks off their Carnival in the days after New Year with a torch parade and continues the festivities up to Ash Wednesday. Throughout this period there are festive jump ups (parties), steel band music, and road marches winding their way through the streets of Oranjestad, the islands capital. One of the highlights is the nighttime Lighting Parade, which features costumes illuminated with tiny lights.

Dominica

For most of the year, laidback Dominica is a natural paradise of rainforests, mountains and waterfalls. During Carnival season, the island ramps up the festivities with street jump ups, calypso contests, and steel band concerts. The fun comes to a head with the crowning of the Carnival Queen.

Jamaica

Jamaicas version of Carnival is called Bacchanal, which typically kicks off in February and keeps kicking until May. Tourists are welcome to join in, but these parties are powered by local energy. Most of the action takes place in Kingston, the islands urban capital, and Montego Bay, the center of the islands tourism on the north coast. Events include road marches, concerts, and costumed theme parties.

St. Kitts

In St. Kitts, they play Sugar Mas, and schedule their Carnival in the Christmas season leading up to Jan. 2, with a festive Last Lap Jam. The St. Kitts Carnival is a blend of holiday good times and Afro-Caribbean traditions, with Masquerades, Mummies and Mock Jumbies on stilts. For the ultimate fun, consider joining one of the costumed Carnival troupes; three of the most popular are Red Devils, The Sky is the Limit, and Birds of a Feather.

Bonaire

Bonaires Carnival season follows the Lenten Calendar, and is a distinctly family-friendly affair, with such events as a childrens parade, and a kids festival. Things get dramatic with a crowning event, in which everyone parades down to the Kralendijk Stadium parking lot, where they burn an effigy of King Momito the Carnival King.

Saint Lucia

Saint Lucia wisely moved their Carnival to July, where they can reign supreme during the summer. Three weeks of festivities include steel band performances, soca concerts, a Carnival Queen Pageant, and a two-day parade of the bands in the islands capital city, Castries.

Dominican Republic

Carnival in the Dominican Republic has an impressive pedigree, dating back to the 16th century. Carnival is celebrated during the three day lead up to Ash Wednesday, and features some of the most frightening costumed dancers in the Caribbean, El Diablo Cojuelo, masked creatures adorned with mirrors, rattles and horns. While Carnival is celebrated throughout the country, Santo Domingo hosts the Grand National Carnival Parade, which marches along the capital citys seaside promenade, or malecon.

The Bahamas

In the Bahamas, they celebrate Junkanoo, a Carnival-like celebration that kicks off December 26 and carries on like a house on fire until New Years Day, with costumed street parades along Nassaus streets. As visual as Junkanoo is, its the sounds that carry it over the top  a riotous clang and bong of cowbells, brass horns and goatskin drums.

Seager, the top prospect in the National League, has all the tools to be a fantasy stud. Long term, his 6-4, 215-pound frame is better suited for third base, but fantasy owners should be able to get several years of elite shortstop production before that happens.

2. OF Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins

The Twins are expected to field a young lineup, particularly in the outfield, and Buxton, 22, is poised to win the center-field job. Despite minor injuries the last two seasons, he has ascended to the majors, where hes among the fastest players.

3. SP Steven Matz, New York Mets

Matzs emergence adds to the best young rotation in baseball. Injuries slowed his early development and Tommy John elbow surgery in 2009 kept him out of action until 2012, but he has been lights-out since. His makeup puts him on the path of a solid No. 2 starter.

FANTASY BASEBALL DRAFT GUIDE: Rankings, sleepers and more

4. 3B-OF Joey Gallo, Texas Rangers

The 22-year-old can generate massive power from the left side. But can he make enough contact to make the power worthwhile in the majors? There also is a question about where hell end up defensively, but he can play third base and left field, giving him versatility.

5. SS Trea Turner, Washington Nationals

Turner, 22, had an excellent full-season debut, hitting .322/.370/.458 to earn a September call-up. He uses a quick bat to make consistent contact and has surprising pop for his size. Once on base, he has plus speed and should be able to steal 30-plus bases on a regular basis.

6. SP Blake Snell, Tampa Bay Rays

He dominated the minors on three levels in 2015 and appears ready to take the next step. The 23-year-old did not yield an earned run in any of his first eight starts and has the deep repertoire and shrewd sequencing to keep hitters guessing. He profiles as a No. 1 or 2 starter in the not-too-distant future.

7. SS J.P. Crawford, Philadelphia Phillies

Crawford profiles as a top-of-the-order hitter. He makes consistent contact, has a mature approach at the plate, and last year had more walks (63) than strikeouts (54). He doesnt have a ton of power, but he should steal 20-plus bases and provide Gold Glove defense.

8. SP Julio Urias, Los Angeles Dodgers

Urias is arguably the most intriguing prospect in baseball. At 5-11, 160 pounds, hes built more like a middle infielder than a flamethrowing future ace. Urias blows hitters away with a fastball that tops out around 97 mph. At 19, he has established himself as one of the top pitching prospects in the National League and should be ready to make his major league debut by this summer.

TOP 200 RANKINGS: Whos No. 1?

9. SP Jose Berrios, Minniesota Twins

Berrios might not crack the opening day roster, but he is fully expected to play a prominent role in 2016. He possesses three average-to-plus pitches and has a mature feel for his craft.

10. 2B-3B-OF Hector Olivera, Atlanta Braves

Olivera was rusty after a year layoff relating to his defection from Cuba but held his own in a brief stint in Atlanta late last summer. Olivera is slated to start the season in left field, but he needs to show he has the tools that made him a highly coveted international free agent.

11. SS Orlando Arcia, Milwaukee Brewers

The great defender improved his stock as much as any prospect in baseball last year with a career-best .307/.347/.453 as a 20-year-old at Class AA. Arcia has a quick bat and makes excellent contact, but he can be overly aggressive and drew only 30 walks in 512 at-bats. With Milwaukees shortstop position in flux, look for Arcia to be up by early June.

12. OF Nomar Mazara, Texas Rangers

After making tremendous strides in his all-around game in 2015, the 20-year-old left-handed hitter is on the cusp of the majors. He might not make the team out of spring training, but hes a viable call-up option given his placement on the 40-man roster. He can hit for average and power.

13. SP Alex Reyes, St. Louis Cardinals

Reyes overpowers hitters with a plus mid-90s fastball that can reach triple digits. He backs that up with a plus hard curve and an improved changeup. Reyes will miss the first 50 games of 2016 as a result of his second failed drug test (marijuana), but that could make him a bargain on draft day. Reyes could crack the weak back end of the Cardinals rotation.

14. 1B Byung Ho Park, Minnesota Twins

The 29-year-old hit 50-plus home runs in back-to-back seasons in the Korean Baseball Organization. With Joe Mauer entrenched at first base, Park should get plenty of opportunities to continue his power-hitting ways as a designated hitter.

15. OF Hyun-soo Kim, Baltimore Orioles

The 28-year-old is expected to win the left-field job in spring training after he signed a two-year, $7 million deal out of South Korea. Because he makes such easy contact, he could hit for a productive batting average.",[]

Hillary Clinton talks about jobs in Detroit, March 4, 2016. (Photo: Jeff Kowalsky, epa)

Its an axiom of the TV news business that if it bleeds, it leads, so its no surprise that the bloodletting within the Republican Party is at the top of the charts these days. Its also true that good news is hardly considered news at all, even when it affects millions of people and undermines a core argument in a presidential race.

That is the case with the new Bureau of Labor Statistics report on February employment: 242,000 new jobs, 555,000 more people joining the labor force, upward revisions in previous job statistics, and an unemployment rate steady at 4.9%. Investors Business Daily called those blowout numbers. Other news outlets used words like hefty, surprisingly strong, and a sign of the nations economic durability.

It may not always be apparent given the outsized role of size  of hands and other body parts  in the presidential campaign, but the Republican candidates routinely claim that President Obamas job-killing policies are destroying the country.

The Friday jobs report is the latest data to cast doubt on this premise, at least from an economic standpoint. But except for financial publications, it was not featured on print front pages and by Saturday morning had disappeared from home pages online. Even more significant, there were no celebratory tweets about the jobs numbers from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Clintons theme of the day, while glancingly acknowledging progress, was the need for more jobs and higher wages. Sanders similarly said that despite gains, the American middle class has been declining for 40 years and railed against ""disastrous trade agreements.""

In other words, the glass is half-empty. Thats not all that far from Ted Cruzs declaration in Thursdays debate that people are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.

There is no question that wage stagnation and income inequality remain major problems and major drivers of support for the Sanders and Trump candidacies. The new jobs report reminded us of that with data that showed a 3-cent-per-hour drop in hourly wages. Still, that drop came after several months of increases and may be a blip rather than a trend.

Obama, making his own case into what turned out to be a vacuum, said the U.S. economy is the envy of the world and offered Democrats the talking points they should be using: There seems to be an alternative reality out there from some of the political folks that America is down in the dumps. Its not. America is pretty darn great right now, and making strides right now.

Republicans are running on the notion that America is on the ropes and its Obamas fault. They blame him and his policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, for a range of domestic ills including flat wages, high student debt, small businesses unable to survive and people forced into part-time work. Much of this has been debunked, but thats been the GOP narrative for years and it is unshakeable.

The evidence to fight these arguments is right in front of Democrats, but they seem loath to engage. In the case of the latest jobs report, the problem may be timing, with primaries coming up in Michigan and other states afflicted by the long-term manufacturing downturn (even as the new report showed an uptick). But the larger pattern is one we saw in 2012 and 2014.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

In 2012, right before their convention began, Democrats could not bring themselves to say the country was better off than it had been four years earlier when Obama took office  even though he was sworn in when America was in the grip of the Great Recession, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and headed to 10% unemployment, and the auto industry was in free fall. Democratic strategists had decided it was best to play down progress so as not to offend what veteran operative Chris Lehane called angry-bird voters upset over the direction of their lives and the country.

Economic conditions continued to improve, but Democratic candidates in 2014 moved even further from the president. Handed a blank canvas, Republicans painted a bleak picture of a nation on the brink.

Then, like now, that was largely at odds with objective reality. But it didnt matter  when the returns came in, Republicans had picked up eight Senate seats and control of the Senate, and added another 13 seats to their already comfortable House majority. They also added two more governors for a total of 31, nearly twice the Democrats 17.

Republicans have had control of the discourse for months now, suggesting Democrats have not fully absorbed the lessons of the past. If they dont want a repeat performance of 2014 in a year when the presidency is at stake, its long past time to start offering their own sweeping narrative of pride, patriotism and success.

OAG, of course, is a top airline data provider, but they also specialize in airline schedules. To help us answer the question, OAG provided Today in the Sky with the worlds 25 longest regularly scheduled flights on the books as of March 1, 2016.

You can see the list in the above gallery, starting at the bottom  a tie for No. 24 between Newark-Mumbai and New York JFK-Taipei  and going the whole way through to No. 1: Dubai-Auckland.

If that No. 1 flight looks unfamiliar, its for good reason. It just launched Tuesday (March 1), bumping the previous title holder  Qantas Dallas/Fort Worth-Sydney flight  to No. 2.

Our latest list was compiled with flights operating as of the first week of March 2016. The list of ""longest"" flights is based on the mileage of the flights flown.

And more shake-ups on the list are coming. Emirates Panama City-Dubai route  scheduled to launch March 31  will move up to No. 2. And this summer, United Airlines will start flying nonstop between San Francisco and Singapore. That 8,446-mile route also would jump into the top five based on current schedules. Qatar Airways has hinted that it might add new ultra-long-haul routes, but nothing firm has been revealed.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,"At Amazon's bookstores, books are just window dressing","['Est March', 'P M', 'Elizabeth Weise']","Amazon's Fire HD 8"" (Photo: Amazon)

SAN FRANCISCO  Since Amazon opened its first brick and mortar bookstore in November, rumors have swirled about the Seattle online retailer's plans for more bookstores across the nation, with numbers between 10 and 400 outlets bandied about.

Over the weekend Amazon confirmed it plans to open a second bookstore in San Diego sometime this summer, making its march into the physical world of bookselling seem more real.

But is Amazon actually building bookstores?

""No,"" says Rob Enderle, a tech industry analyst with the Enderle Group in Bend, Ore.

""The books are just window dressing,"" he said.

Amazon's using them to create a comfortable space for people to come in and get acquainted with its electronics offerings, he said.

At this point that includes the Kindle Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV and Echo, its popular voice-activated personal digital assistant, music player and all-around shopping aide, which now also comes in two smaller sizes, the Tap and the Dot.

""A lot of people are intimidated by electronics, but they feel comfortable hanging out in a bookstore,"" Enderle said. If they go into a Best Buy they worry they'll be set upon by salespeople, but in a bookstore they feel safe.

That fits with John Mutter's impression's of Amazon's Seattle store. Mutter is editor-in-chief of Shelf Awareness, a bookstore industry newsletter.

He found it striking that while there are bookshelves around the perimeter of the Seattle store, the middle was taken up with large tables displaying Amazon's various electronics for people to touch and interact with.

""It definitely felt like the centerpiece of the store was the devices,"" he said.

During the 45 minutes he spent observing the store, Mutter said he didn't see anyone carrying any printed books and no one actually buying anything.

The Seattle store is about 5,500 square feet but carries only about 5,000 to 6,000 books, a 10th of the up to 50,000 to 60,000 volumes a normal bookstore that size would stock, Mutter said.

And unlike in a normal bookstore where the books are shelved spine out, as in a library, at the Amazon store the books are shelved face out, with lots of space between them.

""If you see a bookstore with the books face out, you think, 'Oh no, their cash flow is horrible, they can't afford to buy inventory,'"" he said.

Instead, Amazon is announcing it will open a second store, although it's been mum on the proposition otherwise except to say, ""stay tuned for additional details down the road.""

Mutter says ""good sources"" in the book world put the number of projected Amazon brick and mortar stores at between 12 and 18.

That makes more sense than the close to 400 stores the CEO of mall operator General Growth Properties Inc. Sandeep Mathrani had suggested Amazon might open. Mathrani dropped the number in an offhand comment during an earnings call in February but later backtracked.

What the stores offer Amazon is much more valuable than sales from a few thousand books  a way to build its brand directly with customers in face-to-face circumstances, said Charles King, principal analyst for Pund-IT, a tech analysis firm based in Hayward, Calif.

In that, Amazon is following a template that's been extraordinarily successful for Apple despite early predictions of failure.

With its targeted mostly urban outlets, Apple is able to showcase not only its devices but its brand to people who are its biggest fans. Thats built a level of customer loyalty thats pretty hard to surpass, he said.

The stores also give Amazon insight into how people actually feel about its devices and how they use them, something of enormous worth to retailers.

Amazons one of the smartest companies out there in relation to tracking user behavior and building future strategies around that, he said.

But most of all Amazon is pragmatic, said King. This really smells like a pilot program that Amazon will continue and expand on if it succeeds, but it they fail, the company wont suffer greatly from closing a handful of stores.

President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on March 6, 2016. (Photo: Abedin Taherkenareh, epa)

Dont buy the hype about a win in the recent Iranian elections by moderate President Hassan Rouhani. As former undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman, who negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement on behalf of the Obama administration, recently put it: Rouhani is not a moderate, he is a hard-liner. Real moderates were barred from running.

Last summer, Rouhani and other hard-liners negotiated a nuclear deal that gives them a patient pathway to nuclear weapons. They guaranteed the regime more time and money to perfect advanced centrifuges, warheads and missiles. The deal they cut will make their drive for a nuclear weapons program unstoppable.

This dangerous agreement, however, shouldnt be shredded on Day 1 of the next presidency. A unilateral move like that, without enlisting the Europeans, would give Iran a political victory and isolate the United States. Instead, the next president should demand that Iran cease its rogue behavior on a range of other fronts, or pay a price for its violations.

Heres how: The nuclear deal permits sanctions on Tehran for non-nuclear activities such as missile tests, terrorism and human rights abuses. Irans regime shows no sign of moderating its behavior in these areas. Nor has it stopped taking American hostages, backing Bashar Assads slaughter in Syria, fomenting sectarian unrest in Iraq and Yemen, or persecuting dissenters at home.

The next president should target the sectors of Irans economy that support these activities. This means new sanctions on Irans missile program; designating Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps for terrorism; and squeezing the economic nodes that fund the regimes vast system of domestic repression. A good place to start would be the estimated $95 billion in investments controlled by Irans supreme leader.

The regime will likely threaten to walk away from the nuclear deal. Good. Let it. At that point, Washington will be positioned to impose new crippling economic sanctions and to take other coercive steps with more international support. If doing so prompts Iran to unravel the deal, we can pin the blame on the mullahs  where it belongs.

WASHINGTON  The Senate is poised to pass a bipartisan bill this week that would provide federal grants to states and local governments to combat the national epidemic of heroin addiction and prescription painkiller abuse.

Senators voted 86-3 on Monday to advance the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which would allow the attorney general to give money to programs that strengthen prescription drug monitoring, improve treatment for addicts, and expand prevention and education initiatives. A vote on final passage of the bill is expected later this week.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, has not yet been taken up by the House. An identical bill has been offered in that chamber by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.

Drug overdose has surpassed car crashes as the the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Opioid addiction is driving the epidemic, with nearly 19,000 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers and nearly 10,600 overdose deaths related to heroin in 2014. The rate of heroin overdose deaths nearly quadrupled from 2000 to 2013 as many prescription drug abusers turned to heroin as a cheaper alternative that is easier to obtain, the society said.

The bill does not actually fund the $725 million in programs that it authorizes, which has been a source of complaint by Democratic senators and the White House. Senate Republicans last week blocked an effort by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to add $600 million in emergency funding to the bill.

""There is simply no excuse for Congress providing emergency funding for the Ebola and swine flu epidemics, while ignoring an opioid crisis thats killing a person a day in the Granite State,"" Shaheen said.

GOP leaders said that Congress, in a massive spending bill passed in December, already appropriated more than $400 million in funds that are available now for programs to combat opioid abuse. There will be opportunities to approve more funding through the passage of 2017 spending bills, said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

""But it's important we act on this legislation now,"" McConnell said. ""(The bill) will bring us closer to ending a national epidemic...It will help save lives.""

President Obama in early February announced that he was seeking an extra $1.1 billion in his 2017 budget request to Congress to pay for drug treatment for people addicted to prescription painkillers and heroin.

The Senate bill includes a provision to authorize the expansion of prescription drug monitoring programs, which are state-run databases that track the prescribing and dispensing of controlled prescription drugs to patients. The databases monitor information for evidence that patients are filling multiple prescriptions for painkillers from multiple doctors.

Non-profit groups that help prevent and treat opioid abuse would be eligible for federal grants along with states and local governments. Grant money could be used to help development drug treatment programs as alternatives to putting opioid addicts in jail.

Grants also could be used to help hospitals, clinics and pharmacies safely dispose of unwanted prescription medication. Special programs to help military veterans overcome their addiction to painkillers also would be eligible for federal funds.

The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to convene an inter-agency task force to develop best practices for prescribing pain medication.

Before Adrian Peterson was trucking opposing defenses and racking up 2,097 yards in a single season for the Minnesota Vikings he was shining bright under the Friday night lights at Palestine High (Palestine, Texas), averaging 12 yards a carry and scoring 32 touchdowns.

Before any athlete can become legendary they have to lay their foundation in the high school ranks.

Each week Ill chat with a high-profile athletes former coach, mentor, family member, etc., and reminisce about their high school playing days; everything from the greatest moment to the wackiest story.

As part of Girls Sports Month, I caught up with two-time Olympic gold medalist and FIFA Womens World Cup champion Abby Wambachs high school coach at Mercy (Rochester, N.Y.) Kathleen Boughton, who is now retired from coaching.

RELATED: Carli Lloyd becomes international role model

Jason Jordan: Whats your best memory of Abby on the field back in high school?

Kathleen Boughton: Probably as a sophomore; she scored twice then went in to play goalie with 1:23 left and stopped a penalty kick to preserve our 3-2 win in the Section 5 Class A championship. The goalie that was in there wasnt comfortable with penalty kicks, she was more than happy for me to put Abby in and when you have the best athlete in Rochester youre gonna put her in there!

JJ: Whats your best memory of Abby off the field back then?

KB: When she was named National Player of the Year and we got to go to Ohio and met Pele. That was just mind-boggling to me.

RELATED: Full Girls Sports Month coverage

JJ: Word is she was a pretty good hooper too?

KB: Yeah she played for me in soccer and basketball since the eighth grade and she definitely couldve gone to a D-I school for basketball too. It just wasnt her passion. She scored over 1,000 points in high school. She was good.

JJ: What were some of her other talents away from the field?

KB: She plays the guitar and she used to love video games. Shes really into music; she loved Dave Matthews Band. She was silly. She was probably considered the class clown; very fun to be around.

JJ: Whats the craziest story you can remember from her recruitment?

KB: One of the schools that offered her was North Carolina. Anson Dorrance was the coach and he wasnt gonna offer her a full ride and he wanted her to play defense. Obviously, she made a great choice by going to Florida.

JJ: Did you always know shed be this good?

KB: People dont believe me when I say this, but yes. I was interviewed by one of the TV stations back then and I still have it recorded where I said, Shes gonna be an Olympian.

JJ: Is it a forgone conclusion that Abby is a Hall of Famer?

KB: Absolutely. Shes the worlds No. 1 player, where else can you go? Shes an ambassador for the game; so that and all of the things that she does off the field for the game, I feel, will definitely get her in.

Donald Trump has made no secret his love of George Patton, the World War II general famed for his victories in North Africa and Europe.

We need Gen. Patton, Trump said in January. We need great people. These were people who won.

Turns out Patton's grandson doesn't think Trump is so great, though. George Patton Waters endorsed Republican Marco Rubio for president Wednesday, issuing a scathing critique that distanced Trump from his storied grandfather.

""Donald Trump says we need to 'bring back Patton,' but I can say with certainty: Mr. Trump, you are no Patton,"" Waters, himself a Navy veteran, said in a statement.

""It's true that my grandfather was known for his controversial statements and aggressive leadership, but he was also known for his honor and toil for a righteous cause.""

The endorsement for Rubio comes in the final days before the March 15 primary in his home state of Florida, a contest analysts say could make or break the senator's campaign.

Rubio trails Trump there significantly in polls but has openly promised a win in the Sunshine State and organized his campaign around a ""Stop Trump"" theme.

Win or lose, Waters said his famed forefather would have approved of Rubio's battle with the GOP front-runner.

""My grandfather was a fighter, and he would have been proud of Marco Rubios fight against Donald Trump,"" Waters said.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,5 ways to successfully tackle a Skype interview,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Imagine this: you are going about your normal routine of going to class, packing in some hours of studying, and drowning your bloodstream in caffeine, when all of a sudden you get an email from a job you recently applied to, asking you for an interview.

Only, they dont want you to come into the office for the interview: they want to Skype you.

A Skype interview? How is that supposed to go down? Here are some tips to help you knock it out of the park.

1. Surround yourself with powerful Internet

Skype can be spotty at times, so you want to do everything in your power to make sure that you will have a strong connection. It would really be a bummer if you cant hear the questions being asked, or if the person interviewing you cant understand your full response because you keep cutting out.

You can do a Skype test call to see how strong the connection is in your house. Test the connection with the service they provide for free, and then see how accurate it is by calling a friend and having a conversation. If it cuts out, the video keeps freezing, or you just keep dropping the call because the Internet wont hold it, you are going to need to scout out somewhere else to have your interview. You want to figure all of this out before your interview, so youll have one less thing to worry about, and will actually be able to focus on the interview itself.

2. Dress to impress

Though you arent actually seeing the interviewer in person, you still want to dress the part. If they see you in ratty pajamas with stains on them, chances are they arent going to call you back. You want to show that even though you are having an interview over the Internet, you are still extremely serious about it.

That being said, as long as you look nice from head to torso, you could not be wearing pants for all they know, but just in case you need to stand up and get something, Id recommend dressing as though you were actually going to see them in person. It will give you a confidence boost, and will prove that you mean business.

This also goes for the place you are sitting in; you want to make sure it looks the part! If your room looks like a tornado just hit it and that is in the background of your interview, they may be wondering how that will play into your work habits. Make sure to be in a clean area for the interview, and make it look professional.

3. Sit somewhere private

If you decide your place has good enough Internet, make sure to tell your housemates not to disturb you for the duration of the interview. It would look very unprofessional if other people are making noise or walking around in the background of your cam, and even worse if they popped in to ask you things while you are supposed to be paying attention to the person interviewing you.

You want to make sure you find a private, quiet space to have your interview, and that potential people that could burst in know what is going on beforehand, so awkward moments can be avoided.

4. Dont be late

Just like an interview that takes place in person, you really want to make sure you are on time for your call. If they tell you the call is at 3, try and log on and be ready by 2:45, so you can make sure everything is working properly and youll be ready to receive their call. If you arent logged in by the time of the call, who knows if they will even wait a minute for you, so you want to be all ready to go.

If some unforeseen circumstance is happening with your computer at that very moment, give your interviewer a call by phone to explain the situation. Hopefully you will have logged in with enough time to spare to fix the problem, but letting them know whats going on is good as well.

5. Focus on body language

Think about it, if they just wanted to hear your answers, they would have simply called you on the phone, but if your interviewer asks for a Skype interview, they also want to survey your body language and how you react to their questions. Are you all smiles or do you have a death glare? Keep this in mind as you practice for your interview.

Skyping a friend and seeing what you look like in front of the camera will be great practice, and they can give you feedback on your body language, and what you should change before your interview. You also want to key into the interviewers body language and try and vibe off of them as if you were sitting next to them in person. Vibing can be a bit harder over the Internet, since you might not know when to interject, but this is where the practice will come in handy.

Overall, try not to sweat it! This method of interviews will soon be more mainstream, so the sooner you become comfortable with them, the better. Remember, practice makes perfect. Now, go kill that Skype interview!

usatoday.com,2015-01-09 00:00:00,TurboTax has bad news for investors,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","TurboTax is making a big change that will cost most investors 50% more money. And investors arent happy about it.

For the first time, Intuits (INTU) TurboTax is forcing investors using the companys desktop software to buy the most expensive version: Premier. Premier lists for $90, which is 50% more than the price of Deluxe.

This tax years version of the desktop version of TurboTax Deluxe is stripping out the feature that allows investors to enter securities that were sold and calculate the capital gains. There is a way for consumers to enter the data manually into the product, but its not recommended by the company since its complicated and prevents consumers from filing their return electronically.

This will be a surprise, says Bob Meighan, spokesman for TurboTax. It has changed.

Surprise is an understatement. It would appear that plenty of customers are outraged. Some claim the change is enough to move them to different tax-preparation software.

TurboTax Deluxe gets a rock-bottom 1.5 star rating on Amazon.com. Scores of users are complaining about the removal of capital gains features in the Deluxe edition. Id give 0 stars if I could. Deluxe does not include schedule D. I confirmed with my brokerage firm that Id need to buy the Premium version to include my few stock trades. Instead, I purchased H&R blocks deluxe version for $35 less than TurboTax Premium, said one reviewer, identified as M. Zuraw on Amazon.com.

Meighan says the change was made to make the desktop version of TurboTax work the same as the online version. The online version of TurboTax Deluxe doesnt allow consumers to enter stock transactions. Users of the Web-based version of TurboTax had to buy the Premier version of that software, which costs $91.98 including the feature to process a state stock return.

TurboTax says the change wont affect many people, since just 20% of customers use the desktop software and of those, only a portion sold stocks. All customers are important to us, but the numbers are small, Meighan says. He also says taking the capital gains feature out of the desktop version of the software makes is consistent with the online version. Customers who are investors have long been urged to buy the Premier version, Meighan says. Long-time TurboTax Deluxe customers surprised by the change are urged to call Intuit, he says.

Nonetheless, it also means the days of investors being able to do their taxes with TurboTax and spending just $60 are over.",[]

On your cheat sheet, highlight these undervalued players who should be getting more love, but arent.

OF Justin Upton, Detroit Tigers

Four 26-plus-homer seasons in five years. Five with 18-plus steals in the last seven. Just 28 years old. Joins one of baseballs best lineups. Time to stop letting him slide on your board.

OF Carlos Gomez, Houston Astros

A first-rounder before 2015 with elite power and speed. Injuries and a bad Milwaukee team hurt his production. Houstons contending squad and great park should revive him.

DRAFT GUIDE: Rankings, more

1B Adrian Gonzalez, Los Angeles Dodgers

The softest landing spot in a treacherous middle-upper tier of first basemen. Mid- to high 20s in homers, 80-plus RBI in each of his 10 full seasons.

RP Zach Britton, Baltimore Orioles

Highest grounder percentage of any qualified reliever (79.1%). Best K/9 (10.8) in his career. Both thanks to lethal two-seamer/sinker. 73 saves over the last two years.

RP David Robertson, Chicago White Sox

Homers may bug him sometimes, but K/9 (12.0 career), control (1.85 last year) are elite. 73 saves over the last two years. Flukishly low left-on-base percentage (65.7) will correct itself and his ERA.

SS Brandon Crawford, San Francisco Giants

Sure, he wont be better than last year. But why is everyone writing off a virtual repeat of him finally paying off a natural growth path? He had the ninth-longest average homer and fly-ball distance among all major leaguers last year. Still think that power is a fluke?

3B Mike Moustakas, Kansas City Royals

Another 2015 breakout bat facing skepticism. His all-fields approach revolutionized his game. And he combined to smash 12 homers in August and September. 30 over a full year  the type of power scouts said he had in his prospect days  remains on the table.

C Matt Wieters, Baltimore Orioles

Even position players need time to recover from Tommy John surgery. Though recent obstacles hide it, remember: He hit 22 or 23 homers from 2011-2013 and still boasts his first-round pedigree. Yoooooge profit potential.

1B/OF Mark Trumbo, Baltimore Orioles

Hes had 30-homer seasons for Anaheim and mustered eight in 173 at-bats in Safeco Field last year. Now, hell enjoy residing in Camden Yards with a likely 30-bomb year and RBI/run boosts in this lineup.

FANTASY PREVIEW: Order now

OF Dexter Fowler, Chicago Cubs

Now that hes returned to the North Side, his ADP should climb back toward the top 150 players. If your competitors dont notice, snatch up his 20-20 potential. Hes one of the best candidates to lead the majors in runs scored.

SP Yordano Ventura, Kansas City Royals

Bad first half was corrected by his great second half. Ks, first-pitch strikes jumped after the break. Grounder rate on the year jumped. Great stuff, great park. If he  and you  can navigate around his on-and-off wildness, he could be another Francisco Liriano, if not a fantasy ace.

SP Julio Teheran, Atlanta Braves

Teheran doesnt have as much K upside as Ventura, but he also enjoyed a second-half rebound in velocity and whiffs. At 25, he has plenty more to show. Hes not 2014 good, but he can be 2013 good again (3.20 ERA, 8.24 K/9).

OF Gerardo Parra, Colorado Rockies

Corey Dickersons replacement had a mini-breakthrough (.291, 14 HR, 14 SB), but no one seems to care. That BA jump could stick thanks to Coors Field, which will aid his power, maybe toward 20 dingers.

OF Josh Reddick, Oakland Athletics

In another 20-homer season, he made strides with stolen bases, plate discipline and matchups against lefty hurlers. Hes three years removed from a 32-homer effort.

SP Mike Fiers, Houston Astros

Few late-rounders have as established a strikeout profile as the rightys (9.2 K/9 career as a starter). Homer problems and Minute Maid Park scare off fantasy drafters. For the price of a sixth mixed arm, they shouldnt.

SP Jason Hammel, Chicago Cubs

2014: 8.1 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, 3.47 ERA in 176 1/3 innings.

2015: 9.1 K/9, 2.1 BB/9, 3.74 ERA in 170 2/3 innings.

Are we really letting 27 ERA points make us forget about his believable breakout two seasons ago that was secretly backed up last year?

usatoday.com,2014-04-11 00:00:00,Downgrade! Only 3 U.S. companies now rated AAA,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Blue-chip company Automatic Data Processing was stripped of its pristine credit rating, a dramatic move that leaves just three U.S. companies holding the coveted AAA rating.

Only three companies, consumer products firm Johnson & Johnson, energy giant Exxon-Mobil and technology firm Microsoft still have the coveted AAA rating from S&P. The top AAA rating is reserved for those companies with the utmost financial strength and discipline in meeting all obligations.

Following its decision to spin-off its stable auto-dealers services unit, Standard & Poors Thursday downgraded payroll processor ADP two notches to AA. The downgrade of ADP is a shock to investors since the 65-year-old company has been one of the few companies to hold the top debt rating for years. ADP was upgraded from AA to AAA in October 1998, S&P says. Shares of ADP Friday fell $1.49, or 2.0%, to $73.73.

S&P dealt harshly with ADP, saying the company plans to use $700 million or more from the spin-off of its auto-dealers services unit to buy back shares of stock. Shares of ADP fell $1.43, or 1.9%, to $73.79.

The number of companies with the top-credit rating has been dwindling for years. Back in 1980, there were more than 60 U.S. companies rated AAA by S&P. That fell to six in 2008. Since then, industrial company General Electric, drugmaker Pfizer and now ADP have been downgraded.

Some companies find ways to pull themselves back into the top credit level. Food company Kellogg, was downgraded to AA+ on Dec. 12, 1984, but managed to work its way back to AAA by July 15, 1987, S&P says.

But other times, losing the AAA rating is the beginning sign of more serious woes. Automakers Ford Motor was rated AAA in 1970 and General Motors had the top rating in 1953, S&P says. Both, though, saw their bonds fall to junk status in 2005 and the companies faced significant financial challenges since then.

An ADP spokesman said the downgrade is not a concern and the company knew the spin-off could result in the lowered rating. ADP is extremely proud of its double A credit rating, which is the highest rating in its industry. We respect the revised outlook from Moodys and Standard and Poors, and it is important to note that both credit rating agencies recognize that ADPs business model has not changed and remains strong and intact, says Michael Schneider, a senior director with ADP, in an e-mailed response to USA TODAY.

I mean it just decides to happen every fourth year? Clearly it thinks its better than all of the other 365 days, and honestly I have to agree with this. Lets think about this logically. If this day only comes along every four years, then we have to eat four times as much on that day.

Say the average person eats 2,000 calories a day, which isnt accurate. Multiply 2,000 by four, and that makes for a whopping 8,000 calories that you have to consume in order to make up for the three years that you wont be eating on February 29th. Okay, so maybe thats not exactly how it works.

16. Sausage and Artichoke Penne

This easy homemade pasta dish is both comforting and edgy, kinda like February 29th. Dig in.

usatoday.com,2015-08-27 00:00:00,Ask Matt: How to be calm during corrections,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Q: How can I stop worrying so much during corrections?

A: Its easy to feel like a stock market genius during bull markets. But when the correction comes  and it will come  the doubts creep in.

Investors who confidently toss their 401(k) statements in the trash each quarter  during a correction  tally their losses. Investors who bragged about the hot tech and biotech stocks they owned  might sell in panic. People who normally dont pay much attention to their retirement accounts, during a correction, wonder if they need to do something.

Corrections are a great chance to gauge how you would might feel if the market were to go into an extended bear market. If youre feeling uneasy about a 10% decline from a bull market top, imagine how much worse youll feel if theres a protracted period of 20% losses  or worse. The answer? If youre buying individual stocks, you should know at what price you would sell at the time you buy the stock. If youre not trading individual stocks, you still need to build a diversified portfolio you will be comfortable with over the long term. If you have the right portfolio for the long-term, short-term swings shouldnt bother you much. If they do, your portfolio is wrong and its time to adjust it.

usatoday.com,2016-02-24 00:00:00,"Yahoo shares down amid shareholder concerns, Time Inc. interest","['Mike Snider', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Shares of Yahoo were down more than 2% Wednesday, a day after reports of Time Inc.s interest in the struggling Net company and a shareholders urging an expedited sale of Yahoos assets.

Yahoo (YHOO) shares were down 2.6% in early trading Wednesday to $29.87. Shares closed down 2% Tuesday to $30.67.

Late Tuesday, shareholder Canyon Capital sent a letter to Yahoos board  and CEO Marissa Mayer and CFO Ken Goldman  urging the company to quickly sell off its core business, Reuters reported. We remain concerned that the process is not moving as quickly as it should, and that Company management does not fully support the Boards direction in this regard, the letter said.

Some of Yahoos large investors, including Starboard Value and SpringOwl have pressured Yahoo to sell all or part of its core Internet business, such as its online and mobile advertising technology and content such as Yahoo Sports.

STORY: Yahoo action fails to lift threat of board battle.

Time Inc. emerged as another potential buyer for at least a portion of Yahoo on Tuesday. The magazine company got a merger presentation from Citigroup, Bloomberg reported, citing persons familiar with the matter.

Despite Time Inc.s size  its market cap is about $1.4 billion  the deal could be feasible using a tax-free deal called a Reverse Morris Trust that involves a spun-off subsidiary, the people told Bloomberg.

Among other potential buyers of Yahoo, AT&T, Comcast and Verizon would be the best fits, said analyst Neil Doshi of Mizuho Securities in a note to investors on Monday. All three companies have huge subscriber bases across Internet and TV services, and Verizon & AT&T have leading mobile services in the U.S. Each of these companies could easily absorb Yahoo and Yahoo could provide clear synergies to their businesses, he said.

Doshi, who maintained a neutral rating on Yahoo with a price target of $29, also noted the importance of speed. We expect Yahoo will be more vulnerable a year from now to losing users and ultimately ad dollars to larger platform like Facebook, Google, and high profile startups like Snapchat and Pinterest.

On a day the Dow and Wall Street celebrated the bull market's seventh birthday, oil prices rebounded and U.S. stocks finished slightly higher after a down day Tuesday that snapped a five-session winning streak.

Climbing a slight 0.2% was the Dow Jones industrial average, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite logged gains of 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.

The bullish trend that has been in place since the February 11 stock market bottom is hoping to continue today as investors latch on to recent data that has debunked the notion that the U.S. is headed for an imminent recession and lessened fears of aggressive interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.

Wednesday marked a big milestone for Wall Street. The current bull market, which was born March 9, 2009, during the tail-end of the Great Recession, turns 7 today. The benchmark U.S. stock market, which closed Tuesday at 1979.26, notched its last record close of 2130.82 on May 21, 2015.

At its bull market peak it was up 215%, driven in large part by central bank stimulus that propelled the economy out of recession and made stocks an attractive alternative to lower-yielding fixed-income securities.

The current S&P 500 bull market is the third-longest in history and is ranked No. 5 in performance. A bull market is defined as a 20% rise from a low without a 20% drop, or bear market, along the way.

According to historians and Wall Street statisticians, the bull market, which kicks off its eighth year today, will have to make another record high for it to go down as a seven year bull. The reason. If the S&P 500 does suffer a 20% drop before hitting a fresh record, the end date for this bull will revert back to May 21, 2015, when it hit its highest close during the run.

Wednesday, Wall Street pros will be looking ahead to a key meeting of the European Central Bank tomorrow. Investors expect the ECB deliver on its promises to deliver more stimulus to help counterract weak growth and tepid inflation in the eurozone. The ECB is also expected to push interest rates deeper into negative territory.

Stocks in Europe were rebounding Wednesday after losing ground Tuesday. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 was up 1.1%.

Shares were lower in Asia, with stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and mainland China all closing lower.

Take heart, kids: Unlike fetch, the Mean Girls musical is actually happening.

Queen Tina Fey herself confirmed it in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. The actress/writer, who penned the original movie that we still obsess about more than 10 years later, said that, although they havent finished writing the musical yet, its close  yes, pretty close, joking that it will come out in 2027 (or) whenever Hamilton closes.

Why the hold up? Fey also admitted that they are having trouble figuring out when the first act should end, and what would be the big 11 oclock number. Well, if she's having issues deciding what the musical numbers should be, we at Entertain This! are very, very, very happy to help.

We present our imagined tracklist for Mean Girls: The Musical. And we are only like, 70% joking about these. They should all be songs. Wed pay to see them as songs.

1. The Limit Does Not Exist: A classic inspirational Broadway I Want song that refrains at the beginning and end of the play. Sung by Cady solo at the beginning, it becomes a Mathletes group number at the end. Someone definitely lifts Cady up a la Dirty Dancing at the climax. Hoai-Tran Bui

2. Army Pants and Flip Flops: An ode to the Bethany Byrds of the world, the bubblegum pop number would be performed flash mob-style as the cast cheerleads the wannabes, who pray a new pair of camo pants and some Old Navy flip-flops will earn them the greatest achievement any high schooler could aspire to: Coolness. Jaleesa Jones

3. Why Are You White? (African Child): A consummate blend of smooth jazz and topical lyricism, this Cady Heron and Karen Smith-assisted track reflects both on Cady's milky skin and the sweeping failure of American world history classes. It invokes nostalgia of Teddy Pendergrass Turn Off The Lights, musing, Why are you white? Your skins too pale to handle. Jones

4. Butter is a Carb: A retro pop song performed in the cafeteria. The Plastics stand frozen in the middle as everyone suddenly becomes a 50s housewife. Even the guys. Bui

5. Get in Loser, Were Going Shopping: This, obviously, is Regina Georges power ballad. It is her Defying Gravity. Her Part of That World. Her Dont Rain on My Parade. It is here that she establishes her status as Queen Bee. And her gravitas. We are all losers. And we are all going shopping with her. Kelly Lawler

6. Social Suicide: The emo indie rock number sung by Janice and Damian as they run circles around a confused Cady. All the dancers in this song wear shaggy black haircuts, black T-shirts, plaid pants and chokers. Pause for the angsty guitar solo. Bui

7. You Will Get Pregnant And Die: Set in the gym. A Ya Got Trouble-style patter song by Coach Carr, where he alternates between preaching abstinence-only sex tips and hitting on all the young female students so quickly, you can't tell the difference. Maeve McDermott

8. Almost Too Gay To Function: Janis Ian's guitar chord-heavy pop rock ballad pays homage to her BFF Damian and his vain attempts to get that perfect red hair. The electrifying riffs will make audiences want to belt the lyrics aloud, but remember: Its only OK when Janis sings it. Jones

9. Kevin G: A rap number sung by Kevin Gnapoor. Exactly the same as the movie. Bui

10. You Go Glen Coco: At this point in the musical we pause from the emotional drama for a short and inspirational interlude. We must cheer on Glen Coco. In the style of Stronger and Dont Stop Believing, the entire cast comes out to cheer for Glen, led by Damien. After the song is over, Gretchen Wieners gets none. Lawler

11. It Looks like Hes Headed to the Projection Room Above the Auditorium: A catchy, rhythmic montage where Cady tries, again and again and again, to get Aaron to catch Regina cheating on him. There needs to be some kind of dance when Damien steals her purse, of course. And the moment when Aaron finally catches Regina will be given great emphasis with the most theatrical tool of all: the spotlight. Lawler

12. But You Love Ladysmith Black Mumbazo!: A heartstring-tugging duet between Cady's parents as they sit around their dining room table, lamenting the loss of the daughter they once knew. The real Ladysmith Black Mumbazo come on stage halfway through and they all break into soaring 20-part harmony. McDermott

13. You Can Try Sears: A frenetic dance number set in the 1-3-5 dress store. Chorus line of lithe salesgirls surround Regina as, standing center stage, she dramatically bursts the seams of dress after dress. McDermott

14. I Did Not Leave The South Side For This: Mr. Duvall's big song, set in the high school hallways. As Burn Book chaos swirls around him, he breaks up girl fights, chases around Coach Carr and eventually just starts smashing stuff with his baseball bat, carpel tunnel be damned. McDermott

15. I Have a Lot of Feelings: An 80s pop ballad sung by that random chick at the after-school intervention, backing vocals by Damian. Think Total Eclipse of the Heart in a high school gym. Also with a modern dance interlude halfway through. Bui

16. Ive Got a Big LESSSSSSSBIAN Crush on You!: It is time for Janice Ian to take the mic. Literally, this song should be sung with a hand-held microphone (this is a rock-musical song, like Take Me or Leave Me from Rent or And Then There Were None from Spring Awakening) as Janice simply goes in on Cady from the stage of the trust falls. Obviously it will also include the bit where the girls carry her away cheering. Lawler

17. You Look Sexy With Your Hair Pushed Back: The show's emotional coda. Set in Ms. Norbury's empty classroom, Cady sings a tragic ballad about love, loss, and Aaron Samuels' perfect hair. McDermott

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Less means more for Baby Boomers who downsize in retirement,"['Est March', 'Special For Usa Today', 'Jeff Reeves', 'A M']","Moving can save retirees money, but there are a lot of pros and cons involved. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

When it comes to retirement planning, there are a lot of opinions on how much you need to save; eight times your salary and the 4% rule are just a couple rules of thumb out there.

Equally important to a comfortable retirement is not just the money you have, but also the expenses youre tallying up, too. And reducing your monthly bills can be a powerful tool for savers who are either behind on savings or simply looking to do more with less.

If youre serious about cutting expenses, the most obvious place to look for savings is your home.

Often a house is the most valuable asset that people have, so it is the source of potential wealth in retirement, Lori Trawinski, director of banking and finance with AARP's Public Policy Institute.

However, she adds that downsizing is not necessarily right or even feasible for everyone.

There are costs involved in downsizing, Trawinski said, including Realtor fees and closing costs if you sell. Also, if you sell you may have to fix up your home to put it on the market, or you may need to make renovations in any new home to make it livable.

Yes, there are potential savings by moving to a smaller place, even for someone with a significant mortgage or even someone who rents. But if youre near retirement you should do some careful calculations before deciding to downsize.

Downsizing Can Add up

Done right, there are a host of cost savings that can be found from a change in scenery. But you have to know what to look for beyond simply selling your house for more than what you paid.

I think you have to look at it holistically, and I think its hard to look at any one lever to pull for savings, said Chris Blunt, president of the investments group at insurance giant New York Life.

The good news, Blunt adds, is that a variety of items can add up to a pretty big difference in the monthly budget of Boomers who are willing to downsize. Those items can include:

 Taxes. Its really dramatic, where you have Florida on one extreme that has no income tax, to states like New York or New Jersey or Connecticut that have very high income taxes, Blunt said. A 7% swing in income tax, if youre on a tight budget that matters. Property taxes can also vary widely even within a few hours drive from your current home, and could result in hundreds or even thousands of dollars saved per year.

 Access to public transit. Being able to downsize from two vehicles in your household to one  or even none  can save you on car payments, insurance and maintenance. However, a move like that requires Baby Boomers to downsize to an area that can keep them mobile even without a vehicle of their own.

 Health care. Many factors influence health care costs, including location and access to good doctors and specialists who are responsive and within your coverage network. There are parts of the country with more cost-effective health care systems than others, Blunt said. For instance, a 2015 study by HealthView Services estimated supplemental medical insurance can vary widely  with a 65-year-old in Maryland paying 72% more than one in Hawaii.

 Electricity and overhead. With moving to a smaller home, you would expect to see lower utilities and you might see a difference in maintenance costs, said Trawinski of AARP. And generally speaking, a smaller and less valuable home will also carry smaller insurance costs than a larger home in a similar area, she said.

Of course, a house isnt just a place to hang your hat. Blunt adds that its crucial to balance your lifestyle needs with your financial ones when deciding whether to change your living situation.

Most of us are not going to want to downsize to the point where we sit in a room and stare at the walls all day, Blunt said.

And Trawinksi also adds that its important to remember apartments, condos and houses tend to be more expensive in attractive places to live, and cost alone shouldnt be your only consideration.

People should think about how they are going to have access to stores and doctors and other services they need, Trawinski said. Theres also a clear link between socialization and mental health, she added, noting that people do generally do better if they have contact with other people on a regular basis.

usatoday.com,2013-11-12 00:00:00,My mom is my R.A.: 10 perks of being a commuter student,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Jennifer Retter', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Courtesy Jennifer Retter Easily the cutest roommate you could have.

During the college application process, everyone  high school counselors, enrollment advisors, orientation leaders  will likely go on about how important it is to experience the residence life.

Many students, however, have no choice but to commute to college.

Unsurprisingly, prospective commuters often feel alienated because the financial, social and health-related benefits of living at home are seldom explained. They only hear the negatives.

Thus, the stigma attached to being a commuter student continues to grow.

As a student with a positive outlook on commuting, Ive decided to address a few of the myths and unspoken advantages that are associated with the college commuter life.

If living at home is your only option, remember: theres more than one way to have a fulfilling college experience.

1. Your mom is your R.A., and your roommate is your cat: It may sound uncool, but it has its perks. My family encouraged me when I was slacking, pushed me through particularly rough classes and even awarded me the freedom that I longed for in high school. Though youll learn to live independently, your support system will be right outside your bedroom door. Plus, your cat roommate wont suddenly start snoring on the rare occasions that you actually go to sleep at a decent hour.

2. Youre more likely to avoid the dreaded Freshman 15: Youll never appreciate your mothers homemade spaghetti and meatballs more than when you realize that greasy french-fries are your colleges only edible dinner option.

3. Theres no need for shower flip-flops: At home, you wont leave the shower feeling dirtier than you did when you got in. If youre neat and organized, commuting will keep you away from a world of germ-infested bathrooms, unfamiliar beds and messy roommates. Likewise, if youre a chaotic mess, you can keep causing chaos without question.

4. No one will judge your stuffed animal collection: Everyone has quirks and habits that are lovable to some, strange to others. If you commute, you wont be forced to expose aspects of your personal life to a roommate; instead, you can decide when (if ever) to reveal your idiosyncrasies to your new friends.

5. You wont cry (as hard) when you see your tuition balance: Typically, the cost of gas or public transportation pales in comparison to the cost of living on campus. Additionally, the amount most commuters spend on day-to-day commodities  food, furniture, weekend activities  is greatly reduced.

6. Money saved, new experiences earned: Because I avoided the expense of living on campus my freshman and sophomore years, Ive been able to plan an upcoming study abroad experience. The money you save, the time you invest in school work and the extra effort you put into getting involved will open up new opportunities for you.

7. The downtime youll have in between classes is invaluable: Theres a big difference between one hour of uninterrupted work in the library and a one hour nap in your dorm. Youll be surprised at just how much you can get done when you dont have the option of playing video games or going back to bed.

8. You can get involved: The opportunity for a well-rounded college experience will always be presented to you, whether youre a resident student or not.

More than hes ever been, he says.

Seems unusualunnatural, evenfor the 18-time Olympic gold medalist who is training for his fifth Games, since hes also getting married to fiancee Nicole Johnson and having a baby all in the same calendar year.

Yet theres something calming about the most-decorated Olympian in history. His perspective is a little different as he prepares for Rio, he says.

Hes excited to become a dad.

I was laying on (Johnsons) stomach the other night just listening and every now and then Id feel something on my head, Phelps said. Hes kicking and moving around. Its really cool being able to go through this process for the first time. Something Ill remember forever.

Phelps and Johnson dated on and off for years. They reunited for good following his second drunken driving arrest on Sept. 30, 2014 and subsequent rehab stint. Phelps proposed in February 2015 and they plan to get married after Rio.

As the swimmer worked out in front of media members for about 30 minutes at Under Armour headquarters on Tuesday, Johnson watched with a permanent smile, taking pictures and holding Phelps Gatorade.

Nicole and I have known each other for so long and were both very comfortable with one another, so Id say I feel relaxed, probably more relaxed than I ever have, he said. Its great to have gone through some of the success that I had last summer, really got me excited for this year. Nicole has been nothing but an amazing support system and my best friend through this whole thing.

Phelps said Johnson and their baby boy  due at the end of May  are planning to make the trip to Rio to cheer him on in August.

Phelps, 30, will be the first U.S. male swimmer to compete in five Olympics. He recalled his first Games in 2000 in Sydney, Australia, when he was just 15 years old, had braces on his bottom teeth and was much more careless than he is now.

My suit wasnt tied, didnt prepare myself like I normally do for a race, took the wrong credential, left the Olympic Village, realized it, had to go back and get it, was late for warm up, Phelps said, smiling. There were so many different things that went on in my first Olympics that, it was just an eye-opening experience for the future.

Without having it, I dont know where Id be because I learned so much it helped me get through Athens (in 2004), Beijing (in 2008) and I dont want to talk about London (in 2012).

His trainer Keenan Robinson marvels at the difference between that version of Phelps and the one he coaches now, who is about to start his own family.

The big picture here is his maturity, Robinson said.

Phelps doesnt know what life will look like after Rio. But he does know hell have a family and hell be an assistant coach for his longtime coach, Bob Bowman, at Arizona State. Other than that, hes not sure.

No idea, he said of his life plans. I sometimes look into the future, but I think Im staying day-by-day. Being able to live one day to the fullest and move onto the next one. Thats been really great for us and good for me, so not really planning too far ahead. We have a couple ideas.

But he does know one thingno more Olympics after Rio.

Ive said it before, but this is definitely for good, he said. No more after this.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Would privatization help air traffic control? Your Say,"['Est March', 'Usa Today', 'P M']","The air traffic control tower at Chicago's Midway International Airport. (Photo: 2013 AP photo)

A House panel recently approved legislation to transfer air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration to a not-for-profit corporation. Letter to the editor:

Theres good reason efforts to privatize air traffic control through user fees have been thwarted dozens of times over the past several decades. To use a driving analogy, charging a fuel tax is simpler and more efficient than setting up tollbooths, which require infrastructure and impede traffic.

Further, privatizing air traffic control (ATC) would assure the airlines are in charge and likely would squeeze out the lower end of the industry known as general aviation and the vibrant industry that supports it. The lawmakers who hatched this latest effort will say there will be no user fees for GA, but we all know what happens once you let the camels nose in the tent.

Ironically, airlines are screaming about a pilot shortage, yet many of them want to privatize ATC, which eventually would dry up their pipeline of new pilots by taxing and regulating smaller airplanes out of the sky. Unlike the old days when pilots typically came from the military, airlines now fill their ranks with pilots from general aviation.

The United States is one of the only places in the world where the average Joe or Jane can go to a local airport and learn to fly for a reasonable cost. If GA is decimated and airlines train exclusively in simulators instead of real airplanes, might the lack of basic, seat-of-the-pants flying skills lead to more loss-of-control accidents that have been the root of many recent airline disasters?

Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:

As an airline pilot, I can say that if the Transportation Security Administration vs. private airport screening at Kansas City International and San Francisco International airports are any indication of privatizing NextGen air traffic control, we need to give this system to private companies ASAP!

 Larry Lutz

As a private pilot, I completely disagree with the plan to privatize air traffic control. The TSA is not a good analogy either. Telling American citizens what they may and may not do in airspace is inherently governmental.

 Bryan Bowlsbey

Private enterprise only works with competition. If it is a monopoly, expect inefficiencies and higher costs. Why should something I paid for (in taxes) over years be given away to some entity like this? If Congress would be honest, give the Federal Aviation Administration what it needs and stay out of the way. Then the FAA would succeed in some of these projects.

 Tom Brusehaver

Those who support this scheme have been bought off by the advocacy group Airlines for America and the big airlines pushing for it. They believe there is nothing wrong with handing over taxpayer-funded infrastructure to a private enterprise and letting them run the show to cater to their own needs.

 Angelo Cucuzza

Privatize the system. Government will never make it efficient.

usatoday.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,A solution to hunger? Stop throwing dinner away,"['Est March', 'Judith Rodin', 'Sam Kass', 'A M']","Food loss costs the world economy almost $1 trillion annually.

Dumping food scraps at a compost in Montpelier, Vt., in 2013. (Photo: Toby Talbot, AP)

Picture a field ready for harvest. Any field in the world, it doesnt matter: an acre of cassava in Nigeria, a rice paddy in Indonesia, some amber waves of grain in the United States. Now harvest this imaginary field, and toss one third of it into the trash.

Welcome to the global food supply chain of 2016, a vast system in quiet crisis which requires an emergency intervention to nourish people, preserve our planet and protect profits.

By 2050, the earths population will have swelled to an estimated 9.7 billion people. According to Rockefeller Foundation research, all the food that never makes it from farm to table could feed all of the 1.2 billion hungry or undernourished people on the planet today.

While hunger is the most visible part of this quiet global crisis, it is certainly not the only impact. Indeed, the ramifications of global food loss and waste hit home throughout the entire food supply chain in every country in the world and reverberate in corporate bottom lines. Every year, food loss and waste cost the global economy nearly $1 trillion, which includes $680 billion in industrialized countries and $310 billion in developing countries. Thats more than the combined 2015 profits of the Fortune 500.

It has dangerous implications for our planet, as well. Limited land and water resources are squandered. In the U.S., a quarter of the world's increasingly scarce freshwater is wasted on unconsumed food. Harmful greenhouse gas emissions increase. In fact, if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter after the United States and China.

This isnt to say that progress hasnt been made, particularly in the industrialized world. The adoption of new warehousing, shipping and logistics technologies all have reduced spoilage from farm to market. Retailers have installed misters and improved refrigeration, helping extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Food saving technologies like vacuum bags and services that deliver pre-measured portions of food are both reducing waste in the home.

Despite advances like these, there remains no comprehensive approach to address all three heads of this hydra  people, planet and profits  simultaneously, including the now-familiar problem of post-consumer waste in industrialized nations, as well as the massive, hidden post-harvest loss issue in the developing world.

Thats why the Rockefeller Foundation has launched YieldWise, a $130 million initiative that will work with private, public and non-profit participants across the entire global food supply chain to prove that we can slash global food loss and waste by half. We will meet this ambitious goal by attacking the problem at every point of entry, from farm to table to trash: tackling everything from how smallholder farmers grow and store their crops, to how corporations account for food loss and waste, to consumer tolerance for throwing away food.

The initiative is starting work in Sub-Saharan Africa, where some researches say up to 50% of certain crops are lost to inefficient harvesting, storage and processing. Some of the solutions to this problem are simple, like airtight storage cocoons and polyethylene storage bags. Others are more complex, but equally achievable, such as mobile processing units  and the consistent electricity needed to power them  that extend the short life of foods like cassava.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

These interventions have the potential to transform family incomes and, in due course, local and regional economies. And partnerships between multinational corporations and smallholder farmers enable these farmers to quickly sell their crops to a guaranteed buyer, saving trips to frequently oversaturated markets.

In industrialized countries  where 40% of food waste happens at the retail and consumer level  targeted investments can have a major impact. The average American family of four wastes almost $1,500 a year throwing away delicious and nutritious food in their kitchen. This includes the humble broccoli, which sees its stems and leaves thrown out, despite the fact that these parts are almost equally nutritious and delicious as the florets. You just need to know how to prepare them.

While some change will happen at the household level, restaurants, college campuses and supermarkets can take innovative and creative measures to reduce food waste. For example, organizations and companies like the Food Recovery Network, The Campus Kitchens Project and Aramark challenge college and university campuses to reduce waste and recycle more. Through an innovative platform called Zero Percent, restaurants with surplus food can alert local volunteers to take donations to homeless shelters and food pantries. In Canada, supermarket chain Loblaw sells misshapen apples and potatoes at up to a 30% discount through a campaign to encourage customers to buy imperfect-looking, but perfectly edible, food.

The public sector has a critical role to play in this solution as well. Nearly 200 national governments  including the Obama administration  have already pledged to cut food loss and waste in half by 2030, and 117 cities have signed a pact to develop and implement strategies that improve their local food systems.

No business would ever excuse the loss of one-third of its inventory  and when it comes to the worlds food supply, neither can we. Together, these efforts will help ensure that the earths bounty continues to feed people all over the world.

usatoday.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,The Reagans never stopped dating,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Craig Shirley']","Nancy Reagan remembered everything about her husband and he remembered everything about her.

The 52-year marriage of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis began on a blind date, and they never stopped dating. She gave up a promising career as an actress, but they were in one movie together: 1957's Hellcats of the Navy. Her character told Reagans character in the film that she knew a lot about the moon because she looked at it often when he was away.

The couple had met several years earlier when her name appeared erroneously on a list of suspected communists in Hollywood. She was making The Next Voice You Hear and was terribly upset. A friend, Mervyn LeRoy, said he would introduce her to the president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan, to look into the matter.

They went to dinner fully prepared to beg off if they didnt like each other, but 50 years later, she remembered what she ate (steak), what she wore (a black dress), and what show they took in after dinner (a ribald one-woman comedy show). He later proposed to her at Chasens, and they often dined in the booth where she had said yes to his proposal of marriage.

She remembered everything about Reagan, and he remembered everything about her.

When he was away, he wrote to her daily, letters that were tender, funny and touching. Hed depict himself in drawings crying over being away from her. When Reagan was running for president, he wrote her that maybe being in the White House wouldnt be so bad  youd be right upstairs.

They were really best friends who slept in the same room and same bed for their entire marriage. They laughed together, celebrated together, cried together and when he died, a part of her died.

They loved entertaining but were also happy being alone with one another on their horses or in a canoe. She used to tease him about playing a ukulele while paddling. In the beginning, she wasnt wild about the ranch but over time, it grew on her. She ended up loving it as much as he did, in part because it was one of the few places she could have him to herself. When she sold it after Reagans Alzheimers took him another step downward, she was terribly depressed.

Nancy counseled her husband while he was president, although not on national policy. He used to love wearing a purple plaid suit while president. She hated it. After the 1981 assassination attempt and his recovery, they were on Air Force One and he was wearing the suit. Nancy complained, and he protested how much he liked it. She turned to friend and aide Mike Deaver, Tell the president what the staff says about the suit! Reagan looked at Deaver and asked, Mike, what does the staff say about my suit? Deaver replied, Mr. President, the staff says if you were going to be shot, why couldnt you be shot wearing that suit?

In his later years, she gave part of herself to him, like an O. Henry story. She ate less, slept less, worried more, cried more and, when he died, she mourned him greatly. She never stopped loving Ronald Reagan and never stopped mourning him.

Now, at last, they are together again in eternity.

usatoday.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,Air traffic change gains altitude,"['Est March', 'The Editorial Board', 'P M']","Privatization plan holds promise but gives big carriers too much clout.

NextGen air traffic control system. (Photo: Nathan W. Armes for USA TODAY)

Airline passengers have been told for years to expect a dramatic new air traffic control system that would use advanced GPS technology to replace the radar that has been used to guide aircraft over the U.S. since World War II. The system, known as ""NextGen,"" holds the promise of shaving time off flights in crowded corridors.

But, as with many government projects, the Federal Aviation Administration's effort to implement NextGen is over budget and behind schedule. Another example of Washington doing a poor job of something a private company could do better?

Maybe. The airlines have been agitating for 30 years to convert the nations air traffic control system into a private, non-profit corporation that they say would work better than a government agency, especially when making big structural changes the government has bungled. A House committee recently approved legislation to do that, and the spinoff plan is off to an uncertain ride through Congress.

Its an intriguing idea. Perhaps a private, non-profit corporation with access to the capital markets and free from the crazy, stop-and-start funding imposed by a dysfunctional Congress could do a better job of getting NextGen and future projects up and running. (Safety functions would remain at the FAA.) Backers note that countries such as Canada and Britain have privatized their air traffic control systems, and they argue that Canadas impressive progress with satellite-based air traffic control is proof that private works better than public.

But the price supporters want is a high one, and worth a hard look. The major airlines have long sought control of the U.S. air traffic system, and the legislation would largely give it to them at the expense of public input that now helps resolve disputes over noise, air traffic routes over homes and businesses, and air service to rural areas.

The big airlines would have the largest bloc of seats on the 13-member board that would run the new system. Representatives of the public might, or might not, get the two seats set aside for appointment by the secretary of Transportation.

Though the air traffic controllers' union supports the plan, not all major air carriers do. Delta opposes it and left the industry group Airlines for America last year, charging among other things that the experience in Canada and Britain shows private air traffic control raises costs to the public. There are also worthwhile questions about how much disruption NextGen, which finally appears to be making progress, would endure while its parent transformed from a government agency to a private corporation.

Despite these concerns, if a spinoff could improve the system without costing passengers more or silencing the publics voice in air traffic control, it would be worth doing. At a minimum, Congress should find a way to provide steadier, more predictable funding not just for big air traffic control projects but also for critical day-to-day operations that should never be threatened by the sort of delays, shutdowns or sequesters Congress seems unable to avoid.

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Study links Zika virus to brain inflammation,"['Est March', 'Liz Szabo', 'P M']","Zika, a virus transmitted through mosquito bites, is affecting multiple countries in Latin America, and is expected to spread to the U.S. VPC

Patients receive treatment at a medical mobile unit in the Brazlandia neighborhood of Brasilia, Brazil, Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2016. The medical unit is in place to attend those who have been affected by diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, like dengue, malaria and Zika. (Photo: Eraldo Peres, AP)

A new study finds that Zika virus, which is already linked to paralysis and birth defects, also may be associated with a deadly type of brain inflammation.

Researchers found the Zika virus in the spinal fluid of an 81-year-old man with meningoencephalitis, a dangerous inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain, according to a report from French researchers in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The man had been on a cruise in the South Pacific near New Zealand, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands.

Although Zika is now spreading in the Americas, it caused an outbreak in French Polynesia from 2013 to 2014 and is spreading on several island groups in the Pacific, including New Caledonia and American Samoa, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The man had been in ""perfect health"" before becoming ill, according to the report. After returning from the cruise, however, he developed a fever and slipped into a coma. Doctors inserted a tube into his trachea in order to help him breathe and put him on a ventilator. The man developed a rash within 48 hours. He woke up from his coma 24 hours after doctors put in his breathing tube, but experienced hallucinations and weakness in his left arm. The man's condition improved, even though doctors gave him no specific treatment, and he was discharged from the intensive care unit after 17 days. His mental functioning was normal again after 38 days, although his left arm remained weak.

Zika is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Other diseases spread by this mosquito species, including dengue and West Nile virus, also are known to cause meningoencephalitis, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Meningoencephalitis is a ""serious condition involving direct infection of the brain, spinal cord and its linings,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""That Zika is being linked to this condition is a very serious matter and adds to the growing evidence of the full-spectrum of disease this virus can cause.""

Zika is usually a mild illness, causing a mild fever, rash and join pain in about 20% of patients, but no symptoms at all in 80% of others.

Health officials around the world are concerned about the virus, however, because of a link to microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and, often, incomplete brain development. The virus is also linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves and causes paralysis.

Last week, a report in The Lancet linked Zika to a case of paralysis in a 15-year-old girl on Guadaloupe, an island in the Caribbean. The girl developed paralysis on her left side, along with severe pain. Tests found high levels of Zika virus in her blood, urine and spinal fluid. She recovered somewhat, and was able to walk without help one month after being admitted to the hospital, although her legs remained weak.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Republican statesmen must condemn Trump,"['Est March', 'Aaron Friedberg', 'P M', 'Gabriel Schoenfeld']","Former secretaries of state and defense need to derail 'classic demagogue' and calm U.S. allies.

Demonstrators in Portsmouth, N.H., in December 2015. (Photo: Darren McCollester, Getty Images)

America faces grave threats from abroad. But with Donald Trump close to becoming the Republican nominee and possibly our next president, the most pressing danger to our national security comes from within. More than 100 Republican foreign-policy experts (including both of us) have already weighed in with an open letter, about the perils a Trump presidency would bring. Missing from the names on the letter, and distressingly silent in the debate, however, have been almost all of Americas senior statesmen  especially those who previously served in Republican administrations.

To be sure, a few top leaders have begun to speak out. Without wading into the political debate, retired four-star general Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, has pointed out that the United States military would be obligated to disobey unlawful orders to torture and kill of the sort that Trump has said he would issue as president. Former secretary of Defense William Cohen has warned that military officers would face Nuremberg-style tribunals if they carried out Trumps promised plans.

But illegal military orders are, sadly, only part of a much larger menace. Trump is a classic demagogue: He stokes fears and kindles prejudice. His divisive, sometimes violent rhetoric and appeals to racism and xenophobia would destroy the domestic tranquility on which our democracy depends. Beyond the damage it would do at home, a Trump presidency would unravel the American-led international order that has kept us secure since the end of World War II, an order built on alliances, freedom of the seas, respect for international law, defense of human rights, opposition to aggression, free trade, and support for democracy and the rule of law. Trump either does not understand the importance of these principles, is unaware of them or he simply does not care.

Trump has expressed contempt for Americas closest allies, whom he dismisses as parasitic freeloaders, and admiration for the authoritarian regimes that are now hard at work trying to undercut American foreign policy in regions across the globe. He is on record praising Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and offered him a backhanded defense from allegations that he ordered the murder of journalists, explaining, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too. As for the Chinese Communist regimes murderous 1989 crackdown on student protesters, that shows you the power of strength, Trump mused.

Despite his self-proclaimed business acumen, Trump has declared his intention to impose high tariff barriers on our largest trading partners, a move that would raise costs to American consumers and provoke retaliation in kind, thereby triggering a trade war and possibly a global economic collapse of the sort that accompanied the Great Depression and preceded the outbreak of the Second World War.

If elected, Trump would be the first president in the post war era with absolutely no experience of public office or the management of foreign affairs. His ignorance has become painfully obvious in the campaign. Grasping for words when questioned about the details of U.S. nuclear weapons policy, he could only stammer: I think  I think, to me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me."" Asked to comment on the situation in the Middle East he could not distinguish between an American ally (Iraqs Kurds) and a bitter enemy (Irans Quds force which, among other crimes, has murdered scores of U.S. servicemen in Iraq).

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

A presidents words carry great weight, with allies and adversaries carefully parsing every utterance of the occupant of the Oval Office. Trumps red-faced bluster, vulgarity, B-movie tough talk and intellectual incoherence are already causing profound consternation among Americas friends and bemused contempt from our enemies. Yet if elected, president Trump would have at his disposal an arsenal of weapons capable of killing millions in a matter of minutes. The thought of investing that power in a person seething with anger, morally unanchored, morbidly sensitive to slights and obsessed with his own supposed greatness should be terrifying to anyone with an elementary grasp of modern history.

Yet, in the face of this unprecedented peril, we have not heard the sober voices of those who have the greatest standing to warn voters about what Trumps elevation to the White House could entail. The living former Republican secretaries of state and defense: Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Chuck Hagel, Robert Gates, and Donald Rumsfeld, have unique authority and a special obligation to speak out.

When you have to call your best friend to develop an escape plan as soon as your date goes to the bathroom, you know its not a good match. Even if Tinder, a popular dating app, disagrees.

Ashley Fields, a freshman at Indiana University, landed in that exact situation after agreeing to meet one of her Tinder matches.

It just kept getting more awkward as the night went on...he was so different in person, says Fields, whose best friend conveniently called her with an emergency so she could escape her Tinder disaster.

But lets take a step back from this not-so-happy ending. How could a dating app end up creating such a bad match?

Tinder syncs with your Facebook and lets you like or dislike other users based on their profiles. If they like you back, its a match, which allows you to message each other. But if you like someone and they dont like you back, you are not notified. The app doesnt notify you of rejection, only praise.

Its definitely a huge ego boost, Fields says. Although she used the app daily when she first downloaded Tinder, Fields deleted it after her awkward date.

But not every Tinder match ends in a date disaster story for college students. Fifty percent of Tinder users are 18 to 24. Among these young users is Amanda Fallon, a recent graduate of the University of Southern California who has been dating someone she met on Tinder for the past five months.

He seemed different to me than other guys on there. He seemed real and he was actually interested in talking to me, Fallon says.

Fallons Tinder match came to see her perform with her a cappella group just two weeks after the pair met. They have been seeing each other ever since.

Fallon feels the app helped her form relationships during her transition into adulthood.

Its hard to meet people when you first graduate... in normal life, we stick with who we know and its hard to meet anyone new. Thats why Tinder is so exciting for me.

The apps popularity among young adults is no surprise to Tinder CEO Sean Rad, since he originally marketed the app toward college students.

We felt we were solving a core human issue, and the truest test of that was if Tinder could give value to people in a very social environment like a college, because then we knew we could be of value to everybody, Rad says.

Rad and co-founder Justin Mateen both attended the University of Southern California and their college experiences unveiled the need for an easier way to connect students with one another.

Since Tinder was created to help people form relationships, the hookup stigma associated with the app wasnt exactly what Tinders creators had in mind.

Tinder was never intended to be a hookup app. Less than 8% of our users think of it as such. We get emails daily of people getting engaged who met on Tinder, Mateen says.

Users like Fallon who have had success with the app tend to agree.

[People are] afraid to let it be more than a hookup app because its safer to say we hooked up and nothing came from it than to realize you went on a couple dates with someone and the guy stopped talking to you.

Rad hopes to see a future where students see someone theyd like to meet and they immediately take out their phones to find the person on Tinder. Considering the 6 million matches created on Tinder per day, according to Mateen, that future doesnt seem too far from reality.

Rather than finding someone in your classroom, youre meeting people on Tinder and meeting up with them offline. Meeting someone on Tinder is like meeting them in real life because our phones have become an extension of who we are, Mateen says.

Unfortunately for Fields, her recent match resulted in Tinder turmoil. But for the millions of new users engaging in the Tinder takeover every day, true love may be just a match away.

I was his first and last Tinder date. Im excited to see where this goes. I forget we even met on Tinder.",[]

News: A July 18 tweet from the @USATODAY Twitter account linking to the ""5 things you need to know this weekend"" inadvertently paired a photo and caption that should not have been paired together. When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place.

The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, ""What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered."" That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened.

When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.

Players still on their rookie deals were not considered for this list. Contract figures are taken from Spotrac.

Related: The top 25 NFL players who are tremendously overpaid

1. Tom Brady, QB Patriots

2016 cap hit: $15.1

OK, so $15.1 million may not sound like such a bargain but were talking about a quarterback  maybe the best quarterback to ever play. And Bradys cap hit ranks 18th at the position. Alex Smith and Jay Cutler will cost their teams more in 2016.

2. Michael Bennett, DE Seahawks

2016 cap hit: $7 million

Ill never understand why Bennett signed this contract. Hes one of the best players in the league at a position that typically gets paid. Bennett has publicly griped about his contract but theres no way Seattle is giving up one the best deals in the NFL.

3. Luke Kuechly, LB Panthers

2016 cap hit: $6 million

The Panthers backloaded Kuechlys deal so this isnt as team-friendly as it seems. But for 2016, the best middle linebacker in the game is getting paid backup quarterback money.

4. Jordy Nelson, WR Packers

2016 cap hit: $8.3 million

Nelsons value to both the Packers offense and QB Aaron Rodgers was readily apparent as both struggled when he missed the 2015 season with a torn ACL. He is a legit No. 1 receiver getting paid like a No. 2.

5. Rob Gronkowski, TE Patriots

2016 cap hit: $6.6 million

The most dangerous offensive weapon in the league will make less money in 2016 than Dennis Pitta, who hasnt played a snap for the Ravens in 16 months. How do the Patriots do it?

6. Tyrod Taylor, QB Bills

2016 cap hit: $3.1 million

Competent quarterback play is hard to find  especially at this price. The Bills would be wise to sign Taylor to a modest extension before his price tag gets too high.

7. Delanie Walker, TE Titans

2016 cap hit: $5.2 million

Walker might be the most under-appreciated skill player in the league. Hes never brought up in the best tight end discussion despite his well-rounded game. Playing in Tennessee will do that to a player.

8. Andrew Whitworth, LT Bengals

2016 cap hit: $8 million

Whitworth signed a one-year extension last September that will pay him like an average left tackle. On the field, hes consistently been one of the best blindside protectors for nearly a decade.

9. Brandon Marshall, WR Jets

2016 cap hit: $9.5 million

Marshall isnt paid like a top-10 receiver but theres little doubt that he is one. He spent 2015 making Ryan Fitzpatrick look like a decent quarterback. He deserves some type of bonus for that.

10. Steve Smith, WR Ravens

2016 cap hit: $4.1 million

Does anyone doubt Smith will return to field in 2016 and continue to produce? I didnt think so. Never doubt Steve Smith.

11. Julian Edelman, WR Patriots

2016 cap hit: $4.4 million

New England let Edelman hit the open market two offseasons ago and was still able to lock him up to a team-friendly four-year, $17 million deal.

12. Greg Olsen, TE Panthers

2016 cap hit: $5.1 million

Cam Newtons favorite target will make less money than punters Thomas Morestead and Dustin Colquitt will next season. Olsens cap hit doubles in 2017, so this bargain wont last.

13. Doug Baldwin, WR Seahawks

2016 cap hit: $5.6 million

The former undrafted free agent has developed into a dangerous play-maker for Seattle. He doesnt have great physical tools but he always seems to get open. The Seahawks went to a more pass-centric approach in 2015, and Baldwin was the main beneficiary, catching a career-high 14 touchdowns.

14. Gary Barnidge, TE Browns

2016 cap hit: $2.5 million

Barnidge has always had the potential to develop into a good pass-catching tight end. It finally happened at age 30. His nine touchdowns ranked fourth among tight ends last season while his 2016 cap hit ranks 24th at the position.

15. Kurt Coleman, S Panthers

2016 cap hit: $2.1 million

Coleman was one of the best free agent signing of 2015 after grabbing seven interceptions for the 15-1 Panthers. While you shouldnt expect another big interception total, Colemans solid play in the seconday is worth much more than the $2.1 million hell cost Carolina next season.",[]

Question: How much do VASI lights really help with a pilot's descent?

 Submitted by reader Ian Faircloth, San Diego

Answer: Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) lights provide a visual reference to the pilots position above or below the optimum vertical path. They are very important. Judging vertical path deviation can be challenging; a VASI lighting system or the similar Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) makes it much easier and safer.

My experience is that VASI and PAPI really help pilots make a stable, safe approach to the runway.

Q: What's your opinion of the safety and efficacy of Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) equipped aircraft?

 Howard, KSFO

A: I find the aircraft equipped with Flight Augmentation Computers (FAC) to be very safe, dependable and efficient. All of the Airbus aircraft I flew had FACs, and I never experienced any problem with them.

The FACs combine features found in several different components (e.g. yaw damper, rudder limiter and rudder trim) in other types of airplanes. The use of the FACs is appropriate for an airplane with the sophistication of the Airbus fly-by-wire flight control system.

Q: Do you think that the ""MEL"" or deferred maintenance write-ups have gone too far?

 Bob Kimber, Syracuse, N.Y.

A: No, the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) or deferred maintenance process is a safe way to use the redundancy of the airplane to improve reliability. History has shown that the MEL process is safe. Regulators (the FAA in the U.S.) watch how operators use the MEL process to ensure that there are not lapses or misuse. MELs have been in use for more than 50 years and work very well.

Q: Are the thousands of older VOR stations still maintained to FAA standards? Why haven't VOR stations ever been positioned on buoys for ocean crossings?

 Harold, Durham, N.C.

A: GPS is becoming the standard navigation technology. There are many VORs (Very High Frequency Omni Directional Range) still in service. This technology originated in the 1950s and '60s. Airplanes that do not have GPS onboard use VORs to navigate. The FAA has deactivated some of the lesser-used VORs to lower cost. This process will continue. Radio navigation aids are slowly phased out when their technology no longer is useful. Radio ranges were phased out and non-direction beacons are being phased out.

The idea of using VORs on buoys would be very costly and would not improve navigation accuracy. VORs have limited range; they are line-of-sight transmitters. GPS is more accurate and much better over long distances.

John Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.

Former first lady Nancy Reagan died Sunday. She was 94. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:

Goodbye, Nancy. We may never have a first lady with as much class and beauty again.

 Anthony Davis

The greatest memory I have of Nancy  and there were many  was her reaction to the end of the funeral service for her husband at the Reagan library. To have endured living with somebody with Alzheimers for the period of time she did, and then to have such a strong reaction to what was an obvious great personal loss. She was a great lady.

Now Ron and Nancy can be together again. Forever. R.I.P.

 Craig Russ

I was never a fan of the Reagans and fought hard against his policies, but this truly is a sad day. Nancy Reagan was the last of the old school first ladies  always supportive, intelligent and kind. Perhaps her passing will be a reminder to the members of the GOP that differences dont have to be expressed so hatefully but instead can be aired with restraint, elegance and thoughtfulness. All condolences to her family.

 David Robinson

She helped Ronnie lead the nation with the aid of an astrologer. That kind of legacy we dont need.

All first ladies perform an impossible role under incredible pressure. They have to listen to people criticize their spouses and children, and their wardrobes, hairstyles and vacation choices. I dont have to agree with their husbands politics to appreciate the service each and every first lady has given our country. R.I.P., Nancy.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Gonzaga topples Saint Mary's to reach 18th consecutive NCAA tournament,"['Est March', 'A M']","USA TODAY Sports' Scott Gleeson breaks down some of the teams that are battling for a spot in the NCAA tournament.

(Photo: The Associated Press)

LAS VEGAS (AP)  Gonzaga reached the NCAA Tournament the previous 17 times by building its resume over the course of the season.

The Zags didn't have that luxury this year. Lose in the West Coast Conference title game and there was a chance one of the nation's longest NCAA streaks would come to an end.

Gonzaga took the guesswork out of its postseason fate with a dominating offensive performance, shooting its way past Saint Mary's 85-75 Tuesday night in the WCC championship game to earn its 18th straight NCAA Tournament berth.

""All is well in Zagville!"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few told the crowd inside Orleans Arena after the game. ""The streak is alive!""

It certainly was in jeopardy heading into the WCC tournament.

Despite sharing the WCC regular-season crown, Gonzaga (26-7) had a few smudges on its resume and was not a lock to make the NCAA Tournament.

The Zags took the suspense out of Selection Sunday with a balanced attack and by shooting 61 percent in the latest installment of their rivalry with Saint Mary's.

Eric McClellan scored 20 points, Kyle Wiltjer 17 and Josh Perkins added 16 for Gonzaga, which helped seal its 15th WCC title by hitting 21 of 22 free throws.

Domantas Sabonis added 15 points and eight rebounds, helping the Zags establish an early inside-out game that set the stage for the rest of the hot-shooting night.

Gonzaga's guards, supposedly the weak link on this team, closed it out by scoring 19 of the Bulldogs' final 21 points.

""It was huge for us because nothing's guaranteed,"" said Wiltjer, who made 6 of 10 shots and all four of his free throws.

""We didn't want to be on the outside looking in on Selection Sunday and I'm proud of these guys for these past couple games, just having the will to win.""

Saint Mary's (27-5) tried to keep up with the Bulldogs' shooting and did most of the way through, making 12 of 25 from 3-point range.

The Gaels were hurt by turnovers to fall into a big early hole and ran out of steam after tracking the Bulldogs down in the second half.

Saint Mary's must wait for Selection Sunday to see if it has a spot in the NCAA bracket, though it should be in good shape. Emmett Naar had 25 points and Joe Rahon added 16 for the Gaels.

""It was a heck of a game,"" Saint Mary's coach Randy Bennett said. ""We played well enough to win offensively and we weren't close defensively.""

Gonzaga and Saint Mary's are no strangers to the WCC title game, meeting for the eighth time since 2004.

The difference this time was the favorite.

In the past, it was always Gonzaga. The Zags have been the dominant force in the WCC and beat Saint Mary's five times in seven games with the tournament title on the line.

This season, the Gaels had the edge heading into Las Vegas. They swept Gonzaga during the regular season for the first time since 1995 and entered the WCC tournament as the No. 1 seed.

The third leg of this season's rivalry was an offensive showcase, the teams combining to hit 13 of their first 14 shots, revving up the already-amped atmosphere inside Orleans Arena even more.

""The coaches preach for us to come out and let it rip and it's fun to play like that,"" McClellan said.

The Zags gained some separation with a bit of defense.

Gonzaga didn't exactly keep the Gaels from making shots  they went 13 of 26 in the first half  but did harass them into turnovers that set up shots in transition.

The Zags outscored Saint Mary's 15-4 on points off turnovers and hit 18 of 26 shots to lead 43-35 at halftime.

""We didn't do a lot of things right defensively, but turnovers that lead to easy baskets at the other end is hard to defend,"" said Rahon, who was 4 of 7 from 3-point range.

The torrid shooting continued in the second half and the Gaels cut down on the turnovers, allowing them to keep up with the Zags in an entertaining second half.

Gonzaga used a mini spurt capped by McClellan's straightaway 3-pointer to push the lead to 75-67 with just over 2 minutes left and kept its cushion from there to leave no doubt about extending its streak.

TIP INS

Gonzaga: The Bulldogs lead the all-time series against Saint Mary's 63-29 ... Gonzaga has not missed the NCAAs since 1998. ... McClellan made all nine of his free throws.

St. Mary's: The Gaels had eight total turnovers, leading to 20 points for Gonzaga. ... Evan Fitzner had 11 points. ... Dane Pineau finished with 10 rebounds, including six of Saint Mary's 11 on the offensive glass.

WHAT'S NEXT

Gonzaga will play in the NCAA Tournament.

St. Mary's must wait to see if it gets an NCAA at-large bid on Sunday.

usatoday.com,2015-06-08 00:00:00,Sears biggest problem: cash,"['Matt Krantz', 'Jane Onyanga-omara']","Sears Holdings (SHLD) shares are down on yet another disappointing loss Monday. But the big problem is really the companys dwindling cash.

The struggling retailer reported cash and equivalents of $286 million during the quarter ended May 2. Thats the latest in a breathtaking decline in the companys cash  dropping from $4.4 billion as of January 2006. The declines have been so steady  its easy to overlook how large the drop-off has been. Heres what Sears cash and equivalents look like over a 10-year period.

A rapidly dwindling cash position puts a company in the position of needing to make decisions to maintain liquidity, which can actually make a recovery more difficult. Case in point is the companys plan to sell more than 200 stores and then lease them back. That move gives Sears access to an expected $2.5 billion in much-needed cash, but adds new leasing costs the company didnt have before.

Already, the companys plan to close stores has already hurt revenue. The company posted 25% lower quarterly revenue of $5.9 billion during the quarter ended May 2  in part because it simply has fewer stores.

Its important to note Sears cash problem is caused by the companys poor and worsening financial performance. The company has suffered more than $7 billion in net losses since 2012.

But its the companys dwindling cash thats prompting Sears to make moves  that could make the recovery more difficult.

And thats saying something  given the size of this retail trainwreck. Shares of Sears are down 71% over the past 10 years.",[]

While an advanced business degree can certainly open a few doors, its not necessarily a minimum requirement for success. In fact, there are many lucrative business careers that you can pursue as soon as you graduate with your bachelors degree.

Check out these six in-demand, high-paying business jobs you can launch right out of college  no MBA required!

Sales Manager

Although getting to a management level position takes time, it doesnt necessarily require an advanced degree. Becoming a sales manager is all about excelling in sales, and using that knowledge and experience to train and develop a team of sales representatives who report to you. Youll be the go-to person who helps determine sales goals, and makes sure they are being achieved.

With a median annual salary of $110,660 in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there is ample opportunity to do well in this profession. Whats great about sales is that nearly every industry, from technology and pharmaceuticals to B2B services and retail, is powered by a sales team. Because of that, if you have knowledge about anything, whether its home improvement supplies, cars, or software, you can parlay that expertise into a sales role and work some career magic.

Employment of sales managers is projected to grow at a respectable five percent over the period of 2014 to 2024, which is about as fast as the average for all occupations.

Personal Financial Advisor

As Americans become more concerned with planning for retirement and better managing their money, personal financial advisors (also called financial planners) should have no problem finding work. Thats because people are turning to financial advisors to help them with investments, insurance decisions, savings plans, estate planning, and more. Higher life expectancies and an aging population are only helping fuel demand for these services.

In fact, the BLS projects employment of these professionals to rise a whopping 30 percent from 2014 to 2024. To cash in on this finance profession, all it takes is earning a bachelors degree. Going further to become a Certified Financial Planner can help you advance in the field, but as far as an MBA goes, its not necessary.

Personal financial advisors earned a median annual salary of $81,060 in 2014, according to the BLS.

Management Analyst

Like sales manager jobs, becoming a management analyst is something that happens after accumulating a lot of experience. However, earning an MBA along that path isnt a requirement  its more about your track record and professional accomplishments.

Management analysts, sometimes called consultants, advise organizations on how to operate more efficiently and improve profitability. Earning a median annual salary of $80,880 in 2014, professionals in this role can do quite well for themselves.

As far as job prospects, growth projections are strong, with a healthy 14 percent increase in employment estimated through 2024.

Accountant

Heres a surprise for most people  you dont need an MBA to become an accountant. However, you do need at least a bachelors degree, and many in the field go on to pursue the Certified Public Accountants (CPA) designation to advance their careers.

Still, breaking into this financially focused career is something you can do right after your undergrad years. Accountants work mainly with financial records, ensuring everything is correct and above board, and preparing all necessary taxes. Nearly every company in the world, and a good number of individuals, require accounting services, so work is readily available.

A growth rate of 11 percent is expected between 2014 and 2024, and the median salary for accountants was $65,940 as of 2014. But depending on the location and the type of company you work for (or if you go into private practice), that number can soar.

Market Research Analyst

More than ever, marketing has become a science, as technology has improved the way companies examine consumer insights. That also explains why theres a huge demand for market research analysts. With an expected job growth of 19 percent through 2024, the data suggests that its a position worth targeting once you complete your bachelors degree.

The median salary for market research analysts, who spend their days studying their category to help understand the consumer base and ultimately generate more sales, was $61,290 per year in 2014.

Advertising/Marketing Manager

With so many new advertising and marketing platforms beyond traditional print and TV, businesses are looking for professionals with both traditional and digital marketing knowledge. As teams and roles expand, the manager is the person who keeps projects moving forward, by coordinating with creative teams, sales, and other staff departments.

Growth is projected to be nine percent through 2024, so expect keen competition. Still, with the potential to earn a median salary of $123,450 per year without having to get an MBA, this is an important role to fill for those with the right talent.

As you can see, todays complex organizations need a variety of business professionals to succeed, and they dont expect everyone who applies to have an MBA. By completing a bachelors degree and doing a key internship or two as an undergraduate, you will be poised to start exploring many excellent career options.",[]
usatoday.com,2013-04-23 17:46:16+00:00,The Jacksonville Jaguars unveil new uniforms,"['Charles Curtis', 'Luke Kerr-dineen', 'Steven Ruiz', 'Alysha Tsuji', 'Nina Mandell', 'Usa Today Sports Staff', 'Andrew Joseph']","Jeffrey Martin, USA TODAY Sports

With todays unveiling of a new uniform styled by Nike, the Jacksonville Jaguars are planning to test the limits of the age-old axiom, If you look good, youll play good.

Ultimately, fans and consumers will decide, but the new uniform  head-to-toe black with accents of teal and gold, claw marks at the shoulders and neckline, and a sharp helmet that fades from gold at the base to a matte black finish in the front  is undeniably bold.

Plus, because the city has a large military presence, there is a patch on the front of the jersey located above the heart. It features the Jaguars head as well as a JAGS branding wordmark.

Nike allowed a sneak peek a couple of weeks ago at its Beaverton, Ore., headquarters, also revealing its designs for two other teams who will receive a makeover this season  the Minnesota Vikings and the Miami Dolphins, who will unveil their new looks Thursday.

They all have their own little twist of what they feel is unique to their fan base that they want to play into, why people live in their area, and we want that to be the unique storytelling part within the uniform, said Todd Van Horne, Nike vice president and creative director of football.

Last year, the Seattle Seahawks were the first team to take the Nike Elite 51 Uniform plunge, and theirs was a decidedly sleeker and advanced design. Because Jacksonville has only been a NFL franchise since 1995, tradition wasnt a sticking point as it certainly was for the Vikings and, to a lesser extent, the Dolphins.

Its a forward-looking uniform  (owner) Shahid Khan wanted it that way, Van Horne said. They dont have the history of some of the traditional teams. Theyre in a city that Shad wants to revitalize. Its a serious point of pride for the city and reflecting the culture.

That was a part of a lot of our conversations  what the essence of Jacksonville is, and where he can see it growing. And the Jaguars are a big part of that.

Added Khan, in a statement provided by Nike: These uniforms balance our tradition with the future. The military-style badge on the front of the jersey speaks directly to the strong relationship we have with our hometown of Jacksonville. These new uniforms leave no doubt about our brand essence of being proud, bold and committed. I believe our new look will energize and inspire both our players and fans. Its clearly a new era for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Canned soup, processed meat and cereal may not be high-tech or trendy businesses. But investors are eating them up.

Food stocks have turned into surprise hits with investors this year, even as the rest of the market struggles. Nine food, beverage, tobacco and restaurant stocks in the Standard & Poor's 1500 index, including meat processor Tyson (TSN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Campbell Soup (CPB), have soared 15% or more this year, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. That's an impressive showing compared with the 1.8% decline by the entire S&P 1500.

It's not just a few lucky stocks, either. The 68 stocks in these food categories of the S&P 1500 have gained an average of 4.4% in 2016 and nearly two-thirds of those 68 stocks are up during a period that has challenged the rest of the market. Investors are even willing to pay up for food stocks, as the average price-to-earnings ratio on companies has risen to nearly 27, which is 11% higher higher than the trailing P-E on the entire S&P 1500 measured the same way.

Food stocks are gaining favor with investors because they have many attributes that make them appealing, even if the economy's growth softens, says Christopher Growe, investment analyst at Stifel. For instance, these companies are ""defensive,"" meaning consumers must buy food no matter if the economy slows down or not. Three quarters of the stocks also pay dividends averaging 2.3%. ""These factors all come together to support the premium multiple for the group,"" Growe says.

Campbell Soup may be best known for its iconic soup cans. But for investors, its gains are delicious. Shares are up 19% this year and nearly 40% the past 12 months, which makes the broad market's losses during those same periods look even worse. The company continues to look for more products to appeal to younger consumers. Revenue is expected to fall about 1% to $8 billion this year but resume growth in 2017, according to analysts polled by S&P Global. Adjusted profit, however, is expected to jump 20% in 2016. Investors ""like what like Campbell is doing to become less of a big food company and more of a natural and organic foods company"" with product innovation and acquisitions of food companies, says John Staszak, research analyst at Argus Research.

The biggest food-stock winner is Tyson Foods, which has surged 23% this year and 61% the past 12 months. That's an impressive run given the harsh report released last October by the World Health Organization about the risks of processed meats, which is a business where Tyson is a key player. The company is expected to report 10% lower revenue this year of $37.2 billion. But investors are focused on the fact adjusted profit is expected to gain 27% in 2016.

Don't think it's just food off the shelves that's winning for investors. Of the nine best food stocks this year, 40% are restaurants. Domino's Pizza, for instance, has soared 21% this year. Investors are expecting the pizza chain to deliver higher growth on the top line and the bottom line in 2016. Revenue is expected to gain nearly 7% to $2.4 billion and adjusted profit to add 21% to $4.17.

Investors might be nervous the market, but they are clearly sinking their teeth into food stocks.

Fantasy football outlook

Murray, 28, will be the starting running back for the Titans and receive a majority of the carries. He struggled in 2015 with the Eagles but should play better with the Titans.

Unfortunately, better play wont be hard to achieve from a fantasy perspective.

Its not 2014 in Dallas anymore. Focus on the present: Hes two years older, first off. Another system that runs a quasi-form of the read-option, plus his lengthy injury history, shouldnt excite fantasy owners too much. Tennessees offensive line is solid enough  and likely to be improved in the NFL draft  but with quarterback Marcus Mariota still learning, Murrays upside is capped.

Let someone else take on all of the risk that doesnt add up to a likely reward. Hes a palatable RB2 for the strong-stomached types, and may be overvalued by owners stuck in 2014. He wont lead the league in rushing again, but Murray has an outside shot at being a weekly fantasy utility.

The real winner of this deal is Eagles running back Ryan Mathews, who could author a strong showing in a PPR-friendly West Coast offense under new head coach Doug Pederson. Specialty back Darren Sproles creeps back into flex territory in reception-rewarding setups.",[]

The situation is particularly stark at Greece's border with Macedonia. Newslook

An emergency summit of European leaders in Brussels ended early Tuesday with an agreement to stem the flow of migrants continuing to arrive on the continent, with one official saying negotiators had struck a ""breakthrough"" deal with Turkey for greater aid in the effort.

European Union (EU) leaders agreed to follow up by next week on Turkish proposals to halt departures of all migrants and refugees to Greece in return for EU actions, Reuters reported.

This is a welcome approach, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, but added it needs more time for the member states to fully approve it.

After the summit concluded, Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, tweeted that summit chairman Donald Tusk ""will take forward the proposals and work out the details with the Turkish side"" before the March 17-18 summit of EU leaders, a long-scheduled meeting.

During Monday's 12-hour summit, Martin Selmayr, chief of staff for the president of the European Commission, had tweeted, ""Good progress in difficult European Council talks on solving the refugee crisis. A breakthrough during this night is possible.""

A few hours later, just after midnight, he tweeted: ""Deal. Breakthrough with Turkey. And clear commitment to go back to Schengen by the end of the year.""

The so-called Schengen Agreement, which took effect in 1995, abolished the European Union's (EU) internal borders, enabling passport-free movement across most countries.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said that we do have the basis for a breakthrough which is the possibility that in future all migrants who arrive in Greece will be returned to Turkey.

EU leaders had earlier said they needed more time to consider a plan offered by Turkey to help to halt the wave of migrants in return for more money, faster membership talks and quicker visa-free travel for its citizens, Reuters reported.

At a preparatory meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Sunday night, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu demanded the equivalent of more than the $3.29 billion earmarked so far to support Syrian refugees in Turkey.

""Turkey is ready to be a member of the EU as well,"" he said. ""Today I hope this summit will not just focus on irregular migration but also the Turkish accession process to the EU.""

Diplomats said Merkel and Rutte pressed hard for a deal on the Turkish plan but met resistance from central European states opposed to taking refugee quotas, as well as from Greece and Cyprus.

Several leaders said the offer of increased cooperation coincided with a crackdown on media freedom that runs counter to European values. The Turkish government seized best-selling opposition newspaper Zaman last Friday, Reuters reported.

European Council President Donald Tusk last week had visited countries on the western Balkans route, the main route taken by migrants to northern Europe, to try and build a consensus ahead of the talks.

The EU intends to close the route, which Tusk said 880,000 migrants entered in 2015 and 128,000 in the first two months of this year. The decision carries immediate ramifications with 13,000 to 14,000 migrants now stranded on the Greek-Macedonian border awaiting the council's decision, according to media reports.

The tough negotiations between European countries and Turkey are at the core of the talks.

The United Nations refugee agency estimates that more that 1 million migrants arrived by sea on European shores last year, the vast majority traveling from Turkey to Greece. Some 46% were from Syria. There have been nearly 140,000 more migrants so far this year, the agency says.

Tusk said despite some progress, the number of people illegally entering Greece from Turkey remained too high. Most migrants fleeing conflict in countries including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan arrive in Greece by boat from Turkey.

Tusk said he and Davutoglu believed that economic migrants should be returned to Turkey. The political will is there, but it poses a logistical challenge, in which we have to support Greece, he said.

The leaders of the 28-nation bloc were also discussing increasing humanitarian aid to refugees.

The EU's executive proposed last week to provide $760 million over the next three years for basic necessities like food, shelter, clean water and emergency health care. The EU has also pledged more than $3 billion in aid for refugees in Turkey. More than 2 million Syrian refugees are living there.

""For the first time since the beginning of the migration crisis, I can see a European consensus emerging, Tusk said. It is a consensus around a comprehensive strategy that, if loyally implemented, can help stem the flows and tackle the crisis.

Davutoglu said he hoped the summit would also address Turkeys desired membership of the EU.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country took in more than 1 million asylum seekers last year, said achieving the goals would take difficult negotiations so it may take a while to get a result.""

EU figures released Friday showed a record 1.26 million asylum seekers registered in EU member states in 2015.

(Photo: Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants)

Florida tourism is red-hot. In 2015, the Sunshine State welcomed more than 100 million visitors, a U.S. record. Many of them visit in March and April, for spring break, baseball spring training or the chance to escape northern climes before winter's grip lets go. USA TODAY's Ashley Day, James Riley and Nancy Trejos look at what Florida-bound travelers can expect this season.

Theme parks

Theres an awakening of the Force at Disney Parks in Orlando this spring. First, on April 4, Disneys Hollywood Studios will introduce Star Wars: A Galaxy Far, Far Away, a new live stage show that features the biggest moments from the seven Star Wars movies. Then, the Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular, an all-new nightly fireworks and special effects spectacular at Disneys Hollywood Studios, will debut this summer. Scenes from the Star Wars movies will be projected onto the Studios Chinese Theater and other nearby buildings, bringing guests into the movies.

However, just getting into a Disney park will cost a bit more, as the company has announced seasonal pricing for their one-day tickets. New pricing is as follows: Value days (for less busy times of the year) are now $105 for adults and $99 for children between the ages 3-9 at the Magic Kingdom theme park. Regular days are now $110 for adults and $104 for children. Peak days (the most crowded times) are $124 for adults and $118 for children. Children under the age of 3 are free.

Universal Studios Orlando will begin transporting visitors to Skull Island this summer for the Reign of Kong attraction at Islands of Adventure, a 3D ride that promises to be one of Universals longest ever.

Mako, soon to be Orlandos tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster, will also begin its feeding frenzy this summer at SeaWorld Orlando, with a top speed of 73 m.p.h. and a 200 foot tall track.

Hotels

Downtown Miami has in recent years experienced a building boom. That doesnt seem to be slowing down in 2016.

Later this month, the Langford Hotel is scheduled to open with 126 guestrooms in what was once the Miami National Bank in downtowns Flagler District. The remodeled 1925-structure was designated a historic site by the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It will have a restaurant called PB Station and a rooftop bar called Pawn Broker.

In the thriving Brickell District, EAST, Miami will be perched on top of Brickell City Centre. Scheduled to open in May, EAST, Miami will have 352 rooms including eight suites and 89 residences. It will be the first U.S. property for Swire Hotels, which has also opened EAST hotels in Hong Kong and Beijing. Guests will be able to sip cocktails on a wet deck, dine at the on-site eatery Quinto La Huella, and soak up views and booze at Sugar, the rooftop bar. ME Miami, the brands first U.S. location, will also open this spring downtown with 129 rooms. The property will have a sun deck on its 14th floor terrace, dual sunset and sunrise pools, cabanas, a poolside bar and lounge, and an STK steakhouse.



In Orlando, Universal Orlando Resort and Loews Hotels and Resorts will open the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort at Universal Orlando this summer. It will be the fifth on-site hotel at Universal Orlando Resort. The property will have 1,000 Caribbean-themed rooms and suites built around a lagoon and waterfall.

Over on the Gulf Coast, Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants is expanding its presence in Florida by taking over management of the Hotel Zamora in St. Pete Beach. The Kimpton Hotel Zamora will be Kimptons sixth hotel in the Sunshine State, and its first flag on the west coast. The hotel has 72 guestrooms, including 22 two-bedroom suites with balconies overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway and Gulf of Mexico.

Some reliable grand dames of the Florida hospitality scene will be getting makeovers this year. In the Keys, Cheeca Lodge and Spa will mark its 70th anniversary with a multi-phase renovation. In January, the Islamorada property got a newly redesigned lobby bar. In March, work will begin on an upgrade of the resorts beachfront family pool. And in late 2016, guestrooms will be overhauled and modernized. In Ponte Vedra Beach in the Jacksonville Beaches area, the Sawgrass Marriott is nearing completion of a $25 million refresh of its 511 guestrooms and villas, pool, front desk, hotel facade, the Sawgrass Spa and Cabana Beach Club.

Restaurants and dining

The Sunshine State's in the culinary spotlight with James Beard Foundation nods in Bal Harbour, Coral Gables, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, where Alter is a semifinalist for Best New Restaurant and its chef Bradley Kilgore is up for Rising Star Chef of the Year.

Miami's food scene sizzles each February when South Beach Wine and Food Festival brings chefs and foodies from around the world, and many have come to stay. Celebrity chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten (Matador Room, ABC Kitchen coming in 2017), Tom Colicchio (Beachcraft), Alex Guarnaschelli (Driftwood Room, Nautilus Cabana Club) and Spike Mendelsohn (Sunny's) opened restaurants in the last year or so. In February, Matthew Kenney introduced plant-based and raw food destination Plant Food + Wine (along with a raw food culinary school on-site), restaurateurs Cindy Hutson and Delius Shirley opened restaurant and market concept Zest, and the ""Million Dollar Chef"" debuted Kaori by Walter Martino with $300-$700 tasting menus that fuse Italian and Japanese with indulgences like truffle and edible gold. Also look for new multi-venue lifestyle concepts Hyde Beach Kitchen + Cocktails (Hallandale Beach) and River Yacht Club (Miami) both offering oceanfront dining in south Florida.

Central Florida visitors can look forward to enhanced dining in the Orlando International Airport with a Cask & Larder outpost, Jersey Mike's Subs, Asian Chao Oriental Eatery, and Green Leaf's & Bananas in the newly renovated Terminal 2 (Southwest and Virgin America) Food Hall. Plus, Wahlburgers opened an Orlando outpost in February.

Spring travelers can experience Florida's famous Strawberry Festival and the National Cuban Sandwich Festival in Tampa in March, plus the Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Parade & Festival (March 12-13), Marathon Seafood Festival (March 12-13), and Marco Island Seafood & Music Festival (March 18-20). Meanwhile, craft beer fans can find new Florida brews at Bog Brewing and Ancient City Brewing in St. Augustine, Wicked Barley Brewing Co. in Jacksonville, and Hidden Springs Ale Works in Tampa.

Events and festivals

Baseball spring training runs through early April with games on both coasts and the Orlando corridor.

Boat lovers should flock to Miami for Sailing Week March 6-12, and to nearby Palm Beach for the International Boat Show March 17-20.

Daytona Bike Week, one of the USA's largest motorcyle festivals, runs March 4-13.

The Concept_One, made by Croatian automaker Rimac Automobili, puts the Tesla to shame with its performance and high-class interior. The car can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 2.6 seconds, reach 120 mph in 6.2 seconds and has a top speed of 221 mph, according to The Washington Post.

The interior, which does not contain any plastic, is made totally of carbon, aluminum and alcantara  a fabric thats used in yachts.

The Post reports that the Concept_One costs about $933,000 without taxes. But before you reach for your credit card, its worth noting that only eight vehicles will be made, so only the richest of the rich will be able to bask in its super-car glory.

However, for everyone else, there is some good news: Tesla is promising a $35,000 car this year, according to the Post. For comparison, thats about the price of a higher-end Honda Accord  definitely more cost-effective than any $1 million super car.

Its still pretty cool, though.

Last Wednesday during a panel series at Manhattans Florence Gould Hall, New York Times cultural reporter Melena Ryzik asked Fey whether a Mean Girls musical could exist in the future, according to The Huffington Post.

Fey confirmed it would, saying, My husband (composer) Jeff Richmond and I, (along with lyricist) Nell Benjamin, have been working on it.

Fey also confirmed a musical was happening a day prior in a conversation with radio host Howard Stern.

usatoday.com,2016-02-11 00:00:00,Why you should book a trip,"['Special For Usa Today', 'Melanie Reffes']","Time passes so slowly here you may think your watch has stopped working. Barbuda is where you can truly escape it all; to experience the Caribbean like it once was before all-inclusive plans and swim-up bars. Sometimes confused with Barbados or Bermuda, Antiguas little-known sister island 27 miles to the north is a stand-alone standout with stunning vistas from end to end. Long after Princess Diana put it on the map for 15 minutes when she escaped the glaring lens of the paparazzi to stroll the beaches with the two young princes, Barbuda remains a portal to an era when frigate birds ruled the roost and eco-resort wasn't yet in the vocabulary.

Depending on whom you ask, between 1,500 and 2,000 people live on the island, 20,000 frigate birds live in the sanctuary and no more than 100 beds for heads are available in three hotels and a smattering of small guesthouses. Ridiculously picturesque, the low-lying coral island is vintage Caribbean with no-name roads that lead to the beaches and a capital city that is more like a village than anything else. For a small isle, there are plenty of historic sites. If you must pick just one, Martello Tower on the south coast is hard to miss and was built by the British in 1745 with an elevated gun platform and walls as thick as a fortress.

Measuring in at 15 miles long and eight miles wide, the locals will tell you 'we have nothing yet we have everything'. By nothing they mean no hotel towers or pricey villas and by everything they are referring to endless stretches of wild beaches that are dotted with shells, driftwood and pink sand, the largest frigate bird sanctuary in the western hemisphere, carefree donkeys, stately horses, caves dating back millions of years and deer and wild boar that are legally hunted during certain months of the year. With the deep blue Atlantic Ocean lapping the east coast and the calmer Caribbean Sea on the west side, the water is so clear youll find turtles, sharks and rays swimming below the waves. Sand is so plentiful that its scooped up by the ton and shipped to other, less beach-blessed islands. A soothing balm in the midst of the busy Eastern Caribbean, Barbuda hasnt made its way onto many bucket lists or into the pages of many guidebooks, at least not yet.

Getting There

From Antigua, take a 15-minute flight on ABM Air or Fly Montserrat or a 90-minute sail on a Barbuda Express ferry (but check sea conditions before you buy as the water can get choppy). For those who like birds-eye views from the air, take the high road and go for the gold with a ride on a helicopter with a provider like Caribbean Helicopters. Flying a copter for nearly two decades, Captain Patrick Muirhead is living his dream. ""I left England years ago to live in the tropics,"" he says operating the controls high above Antigua, ""I now have the perfect job and although I have flown from Antigua to Barbuda thousands of times, I never tire of the views high above the sea."" Copter passengers check into a petite pink terminal in Antigua and are shown a brief safety video before boarding. Once on board, a headset lets you listen in on air traffic control as you take in the clouds outside the window that are spun like cotton candy.

The Village

Named after the Codrington family that leased the island from England until 1870, Codrington is the capital of Barbuda and where most of the residents live. In 1685, Christopher Codrington and his brother John were granted not only land rights but also rights to the valuable shipwrecks along the reefs. The preeminent family during the eighteenth century, their land produced food for the island and supplied slaves for the sugar plantations on Antigua. On the highest point of Barbuda  124 feet above the sea  you can still see the ruins of the Codrington Estate known locally as Willy Bob or Highland House. The view from the top offers spectacular panoramas of the coastline while the floors, lower walls and a large cistern are all that remain of the home. In the center of the village behind the Post Office, Government House that was built in 1694 has never been repaired from damage suffered during several hurricanes.

Slow-moving and sleepy, the village is charmingly frozen in time with no traffic lights, not a lot of people and not a lot of anything apart from a minuscule airport, a few stores where you can buy a lottery ticket, a school, a quaint museum, a church, Byrons Bar (when Byron is there), Rockstones Jazz Cafe (when its open), a kayak and bike rental shop (when someone is there to rent them to you), brightly painted clapboard houses where multi-generational families hang out on the front porch with their adorably polite kids.

Frigate flyers

Ask Captain Arthur Speedy Walter anything about frigate birds and youll be treated to a boatload of trivia as he steers toward the Codrington Lagoon Park. Slowing down close to the mangroves, there are plenty of oohs and aahs as Speedy points to the Frigate Bird Colony. Thousands of the graceful birds flit about the swamp with the males easily spotted by their cherry tomato red throat pouch that inflates like a balloon as they scour for a mate. Keep your eyes open as they line up in the bushes and with an air of feathered machismo, arch their heads and puff out their pouches as the females take to the sky. Known as Fregata magnificens to serious bird watchers, the seabirds are, indeed, magnificent with their forked tails, angular wings and effortless flight. Island tours with Speedys It's A Bit Fishy Yacht Services depart from the pier in Codrington. ""This is one of the most peaceful places on earth,"" smiles Speedy while watching the birds as if it was his first time, ""some folks want to linger all afternoon.""

Secluded, Sandy Beaches

Pick out a shady spot under a sea grape tree and write the next chapter (or the first chapter) of your life story. Three miles of soft sand at the southern end of Barbuda, Princess Diana Beach was one of the few places on the planet where she wasnt followed. It was named for the Royal on July 1, 2011; the day she would have turned 50. Seeking solace and craving privacy, the Princess and her two young princes were fans of the pink and white sandy beach with the shady sea grape trees adjacent to the now closed K-Club Resort.

At the other end of the island, the deserted 15-mile strand between Cedar Tree Point and Billy Point invites the peaceful wanderings of those lucky enough to find it. The unnamed beach is the welcome mat for the Barbuda Belle Resort, if youre lucky enough to find that, and where the Hashtag #VacationEnvy says it all.

Adventures for the Fearless

Four miles northeast of Codrington, Darby Cave is really a vertical walled sink hole that formed after the collapse of a cave. In the middle of the Highlands, its an hour-long trek but worth the effort to see the gigantic, 350-foot wide hole that suddenly appears with the tops of the tall palmetto trees at eye level. Reaching up to eight feet in height under the overhang, the greenish-white mass of limestone is glass smooth. Particularly interesting for archaeology buffs, a two-million year old fossilized shark's tooth was discovered in the limestone. Today, the cave is inhabited by bats, frogs and a variety of birds flitting about the rainforest-like foliage. Locals know this area well and can show you the route or you can ask about tours at the Tourism office in the blue building near the jetty in Codrington.

Where to Stay

Barbuda Belle is the newest resort to open and joins the nine-room Lighthouse Bay on Low Bay Beach, with his-and-hers alfresco massage tables and a small herd of horses that take guests around, and Coco Point Lodge, which is so exclusive that you have to know someone who has stayed there in order to get in yourself. Reachable only by boat from Codrington, Barbuda Belle is a six-bungalow retreat sitting on a solitary, 15-mile long swath of footprint-free beach within the Codrington Lagoon Park. Solar-powered, the eco-elegant hotel is rustic and remote with each bungalow outfitted with big comfy beds that look out at the sea from louvered windows. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and cocktails are served at The Mangrove restaurant under the watchful eye of Chef Luc Izard. Whirling around his modern kitchen with ooh-la-la French flair, the chef is a culinary wizard with his seafood signatures like a two-pound locally-caught spiny lobster that is grilled, buttered and artfully arranged on a sharing a plate with leeks draped in melted cheddar cheese. A grilled snapper gracing a green banana leaf is also sublime. Sweet meringue crowned with fresh berries is dessert par excellence.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Michael Finke scored 17 points and made five 3-pointers to lead No. 12 seed Illinois past 13th-seeded Minnesota 85-52 on Wednesday in the Big Ten tournament's opening round.

The Fighting Illini (14-18) play No. 5 seed and 20th-ranked Iowa on Thursday in second-round action.

Kendrick Nunn added 15 points for Illinois while Malcolm Hill had 14 and Jalen Coleman-Lands 13. The Fighting Illini made 32 of 58 field-goal attempts (55 percent), including 14 of 26 from 3-point range (54 percent). Nunn, Hill and Coleman-Lands were a collective 15 of 26 from the field.

Illinois outrebounded Minnesota 35-26 and forced 15 Golden Gopher turnovers. Minnesota shot 39.2 percent (20 of 51) in dropping a fourth consecutive game to end the season.

Minnesota (8-23), which finished with a school record for single-season losses, got 12 points from Charles Buggs and 11 by Ahmad Gilbert.

Consecutive 3-pointers from Nunn and Finke extended the Illinois lead to 46-27 with 15:07 remaining, prompting a Minnesota timeout. Finke's 3-pointer was the Illini's ninth in 24-plus minutes.

The Golden Gophers countered with a 7-0 run to slice the deficit to 46-34, but Illinois quickly extended the advantage back to 17.

Illinois made 15 of 29 opening-half shots, including 7 of 13 from beyond the arc, and led 38-22 through 20 minutes. Jaylon Tate's 3-pointer with two seconds to play in the half extended the Illinois lead to 16.

Minnesota was 9 of 25 from the field before halftime, including 0 of 5 from 3-point range. The Golden Gophers were guilty of eight first-half turnovers, which led to 14 Illini points. Illinois also got nine first-half points from non-starters while Minnesota's reserves went scoreless.

TIP-INS

Minnesota: The Golden Gophers had only eight players available for the game after senior forward Joey King (11.6 points per game) suffered a season-ending broken right foot on March 2 in a loss to Wisconsin. ... Kevin Dorsey (6.8), Nate Mason (13.8) and Dupree McBrayer (5.9) were suspended on March 1 for violation of team rules ... The Golden Gophers lost both regular-season games to Illinois ... Minnesota is 0-6 all-time against Illinois in the Big Ten tournament.

Spice up your stay and try West Indian recipes, piquant Creole dishes, habanero-tinged hot sauces and a picnic basket of sweet Antigua black pineapples and juicy mangos sold by the side of the road. At the culinary intersection of land and sea, check out our menu and get ready for a sweet, spicy and salty melange of island fare.

Coconut and codfish

On the southeast coast away from the fray on a 100-acre peninsula, St. James Club is where youll find Chef Dave Ralphs infectious smile and enthusiasm to match. All-inclusive for singles, couples and families, the resort is also where youll find authentic Antiguan fare on the menu at the airy Rainbow Garden. Start with the Chefs Fish Water; an aromatic bowl filled to the brim with steamed snapper, onions and sweet peppers. In keeping with the seafood theme, taste test the Shrimp Creole in a tangy tomato-garlic sauce with salty cured codfish. The national dish called fungee (pronounced foon-jee and sometimes spelled fungi) is a hearty forkful of cornmeal and okra that looks and tastes like polenta. What the islanders call 'Chop Up' is a must-try soft mash-up of spinach, okra and eggplant. ""Every cook adds his or her own touch to the recipes,"" explains Chef Ralph, ""these are dishes I have eaten since I was a small child and now as a chef I encourage our tourists to try them."" For a sweet finish, coconut dumplings with a hint of cinnamon and rum balls with real rum are a home run. For those not staying at the resort, a USD$95 day pass ($47.50 for kids) includes meals, snacks, unlimited beverages by the glass and watersports for working it all off.

In a mango mood

On Valley Road on the southwest coast, Sarah Henry, or Miss Henry as she is politely called by her friends and family (which includes just about everyone), is also affectionately known as The Mango Lady of Bolans Village. Still sprightly at 86 years young, Miss Henry has been selling sweet mangos by the side of the road for as long as anyone can remember. The mother of 13 children, grandma of 60 and great-grand of at least 20, she is a mango mainstay in her small village selling the ripe fruit for about a dollar each. Dubbed the 'King of all Fruit' by those in the know, mango trees were brought to Antigua by Portuguese traders and are considered a symbol of love (not to mention that they're loaded with nutrients and vitamins). If youre lucky, Miss Henry will also have her special peanuts for sale, which she roasts in sand and salt and sells at her charming, no frills roadside stand. ""A true legend,"" smiles Cleo Henry, one of Miss Henrys grandchildren, ""she is Antiguan entrepreneurship at its best.""

For fans of the juicy fruit, mark your calendar for the Mango Festival in July in Christian Valley; a fruit forest in the Sherkerley Mountains on the south coast. Hosted by Antigua's Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Tourism, the festival is a magical mango marketplace with vendors selling fruity soap, scented candles, aromatic wine and sweet sauces, cakes and jams.

Pining for pineapples

Grown in black volcanic soil, Antiguan pineapples are smaller than those you may buy in the supermarkets at home. Weighing no more than three pounds, the juicy fruit is sold at markets and by feisty roadside vendors. In Forks Village on the south coast, Clemie has been at her yellow fruit stand on Old Road every day for two decades. Displaying whatever is fresh that day, the super-sweet pineapples are her biggest sellers and go for USD$4 each. If you ask nicely, shell peel it for you and if shes not too busy, shell give you an earful about local politics and who she thinks should run the government.

If its Saturday morning, the Market on the aptly named Market Street in the capital city of St. Johns is the best place to pick up fresh fruit, vegetables and fragrant oils. Vendors like Sister Grant with her straw hat, pink t-shirt and red-striped apron are delighted to describe their bounty to passers-by. Arrive early and head to Hazels Kitchen, where starting at 7 a.m. the gracious chef is frying banana pancakes. A sweet treat to start the morning, the filling pancakes are more like fritters; full of mashed ripe bananas, a dash of vanilla and then deep fried to golden deliciousness. A side of salty fish makes for an inexpensive breakfast.

Local food where the locals eat

Open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day, specials change daily with none priced higher than USD$10. (Photo: Melanie Reffes)

At the buzziest breakfast spot in town, Chefs Paul and Sandra and owner Abena Straker are in the kitchen before the sun rises getting ready for a cast of hungry locals that stop by every day. With a menu as playful as its name, the no-frills Suga Beez lives up its slogan: ""where eating local food is a buzz"". Open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day, specials change daily with none priced higher than USD$10. If its Monday, ask for bull foot soup, on Tuesday try the curried conch and on Wednesday, its all hands on deck for a sweet and salty dish called duccana; like a tamale with grated sweet potato, pumpkin, coconut and cornmeal which is steamed in a banana leaf and served with a side of salt-cured cod. Add a wedge of macaroni pie and curried goat and its a hearty plate at Suga Beez on Popeshead Street, a short stroll from the market. Be sure to ask for the homemade hot peppers (especially good on the grilled snapper) but go easy with the first pour, you can always add more. A glass of just-squeezed golden apple juice is as refreshing as it gets on a sunny Antiguan morning.

Food with views

For the real deal (and plenty of tourists), head to the look-out at Shirley Heights on Sunday from 4 p.m. until the last person leaves. (Photo: Melanie Reffes)

Just below the peak of the hill on the west coast, Dennis Cocktail Bar dishes up island fare overlooking Antigua's picturesque and popular beaches called Ffryes and Lil Ffryes. Also a chef, owner Dennis Thomas learned to cook watching his mom prepare dinner on a coal pot and brings those recipes for curried conch, grilled lobster and chicken to his restaurant on the hill. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, fans come early for Happy Hour that kicks off at 4 p.m. and concerts every Sunday afternoon featuring steel pan players making merry on a small stage.

For the real deal (and plenty of tourists), head to the look-out at Shirley Heights on Sunday from 4 p.m. until the last person leaves. A guaranteed good time, the barbecue and sunset party has been rocking the island for more than three decades. At nearly 500 feet above the sea, the views of English and Falmouth Harbours are mesmerizing especially after a few local Wadadli beers and a generous serving of chicken, ribs and locally-caught wahoo grilled with nothing more than a drizzle of olive oil. Order a few Johnny cakes (subtly sweet fried bread that stands in for pancakes) and youve got a belly-filling knock-out meal on the hill.

Trends with benefits

""Our hot sauces are unique because you taste the fruit first and then the warmth,"" says Jennifer Jeffrey whirling around her spotless kitchen (Photo: Melanie Reffes)

Take two entrepreneurial women and their creative recipes and youve got one of the most original stores on the island. Natura Health & Healing on All Saints Road, east of the capital city of St. Johns, is where owners Jennifer Jeffrey and Silvana Moses welcome shoppers as if it were their home. Celebrating the fruits and spices of the island, the chefs turned businesswomen offer shoppers a glass of their lemongrass-mint-golden-apple lemonade as well as spoonfuls of whatever they made that day, like their sweet potato and plantain chutney. Packaged pretty for gifts, jams (coconut is to-die-for), chutneys and hot sauces (the mango variety rocks) are all made in their taste kitchen behind the shop. ""Our hot sauces are unique because you taste the fruit first and then the warmth,"" says Jennifer Jeffrey whirling around her spotless kitchen, ""our flavors change depending on the fresh seasonal fruit available."" Ask the gracious ladies for a taste of their sweet, gooey lemongrass-flavored honey made from best of local bees and youll be a fan after the first taste. Keep up with their new flavors by checking their Facebook page.

North of St Johns at the nondescript corner where Hilda Davis Drive meets Dickenson Bay Street, Papa Zouk is a party-fueled dive bar with a big seafood menu and legions of loyal fans. German-born owner Bert Kirchner claims his rustic restaurant with madras tablecloths, straw lamps and a steady soundtrack of toe-tapping Zouk music not only has the largest rum selection in the Caribbean but also grills the yummiest seafood on Antigua. Open Monday to Saturday from 7 p.m., the star attraction is the spiny local lobster sharing a big platter with shrimp and mahi-mahi. Fish fans will like the bouillabaisse with big morsels of the catch of the day swimming in a tasty tomato broth, whole red snapper and golden brown butter fish nuggets. The spicy hot vinegar adds zing to the delectable crab backs and to wash it down, Ti Punch packs a punch with Antigua English Harbour rum, lime and brown sugar that has been cooked to a syrup. ""Our bartenders pour one very potent punch, then we spin nonstop Zouk tunes and the party stays red hot all night long,"" smiles owner Bert Kirchner posing for snaps in front of the bars artfully decorated walls.",[]

Letter to the editor:

I hope that the movie Spotlight winning the Oscar for best picture helps newspapers, with their dwindling circulations, get a little more credit for all the bad they bring to public view, and all the good they do (Spotlights unfinished business: Our view).

Spotlight showed how The Boston Globe uncovered the Catholic Churchs failure to stop its priests from sexually abusing children, and its bishops from enabling them, and then covering up these crimes against humanity.

Of course, newspapers also expose wrongdoing by politicians and elected officials. Considering how often they uncover fraud, corruption and unethical conduct in government, Id vote for muckraking reporters, crusading editors and supportive publishers for elected office any day of the week.

Considering all the well-reasoned opinions I routinely read in newspaper editorials, I genuinely believe that we'd all be better off if many of our local, state and national leaders and legislators were replaced by the editorial board members who write these words of wisdom. And I am not alone in my opinion. I offer the following thought, written by my expert witness Thomas Jefferson: ""Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.""

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Samsung Galaxy's new phones have fizz,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Edward C']","The Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)

NEW YORK  Apples iPhone and Samsungs Galaxy are the Coke and Pepsi of smartphones. The ongoing debate is Whos got the fizz?

The latest to sparkle are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge devices that Ive been testing for the past week or so. The phones hit U.S. stores Friday at starting retail prices among North American carriers of around $650 and $750 for the S7 and S7 edge, respectively. Of course, various monthly installment pricing deals requiring no money down are available.

The new phones are handsome and bear a strong resemblance to last years praiseworthy S6 and S6 Edge devices. Improvements this time around center around features Samsung brought back (after removing them on the S6s), notably water resistance and expandable storage. And Samsung managed to restore the features while maintaining the thin-metal and premium-glass aesthetic of the S6s. Rival iPhones aren't water-resistant and don't have expandable memory.

*The basics: I like the way both Galaxys feel. The back is smooth, almost slippery, but comfortable to hold. The bezels are narrow. The rear camera barely sticks out.

One significant drawback, though: The rear surface is prone to smudges and reveal fingerprints.

Speaking of fingerprints, the fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone worked well. You can also use the fingerprint sensor to verify purchases through Samsung Pay.

*The displays: The 5.36-ounce S7 has a brilliant Quad HD 5.1-inch display, the same size screen as the S6. The Edge weighs a bit more and has a 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Thats the same screen size as the iPhone 6S Plus, despite the fact that Samsungs phone is considerably smaller than Apples phablet.

Edge is so named because of the customizable secondary edge screen that with a swipe of your finger cascades along the curved right side of the phone. Samsung devotes more space to the edge display on the new model, and I found it more useful for accessing frequently used apps or glancing at headlines and stock quotes.

You can also set the Edge screen to light up when you get a call or receive notifications if the phone is turned over. Once or twice, however, I inadvertently summoned the display.

Theres also an always on display feature that shows you the clock, your calendar and notifications for missed calls over a dark background. Samsung claims no discernible hit on the battery. LG promises a similar feature on its upcoming G5 phone.

*Battery life: Both Samsung phones come with 32 GB of internal storage, the only option in the U.S. But you can expand that capacity by adding an optional microSD card, which is concealed inside the device on the same tray that holds the phones SIM card.

Whats missing in the new Galaxys though  and this applies, frankly, to all the major smartphone players, not just Samsung  is any kind of giant leap in smartphone innovation.

Indeed, the feature leaps here are evolutionary not revolutionary. Here are the major ones:

*Water resistance. This means you can carry it in a torrential downpour or inadvertently drop it in a puddle or toilet, which for testing purposes I did. Fortunately the auto flush didnt gobble it up and the phone survived. Better still, there's no longer an awkward protective flap covering the USB port as was the case on the water-resistant Galaxy S5.

For the record, Samsung says the phones can withstand up to 5 feet of water for up to a half-hour. The phones are said to be resistant to dust, too.

*Camera. The S7 and S7 Edge boast first-rate camera systems that let you automatically focus on a subject really fast, certainly quicker than the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Samsung has also bolstered the ability to shoot in low light, resulting partly from a dual pixel sensor that the company says has been borrowed from DSLR cameras. A new front-flash feature in which the screen momentarily lights up when youre taking a selfie copies a similar feature on the latest iPhones.

I was generally very pleased with the quality of the pictures (and videos) that I shot in auto mode. Serious photographers can manually change the shutter speed, ISO and a number of other camera settings.

*Battery. As with the S6 and S6 Edge, the batteries inside the latest devices cannot be removed by the user, a bummer for some. But the latest phones boast a much larger battery than on earlier models, promising to last longer.

The phone charges quickly, too. In my tests, I powered up from zero to a 47% charge on the S7 in 30 minutes and reached 88% in an hour. On the S7 Edge I got to 41% in a half-hour and 77% in an hour. You can take advantage of fast wireless charging, too, Samsung says, but youll have to supply an optional charger, and the fast charging wont be quite as zippy.

*Worth noting. The phones have regular USB connectors, rather than the versatile USB-C standard that is slowly emerging but still on only a few handsets.

Samsung has been making a big push into virtual reality. A 360-degree camera is on the way. And the new phones are compatible with Samsung's Gear VR virtual-reality headgear. In fact, through a temporary promotion, S7 and S7 Edge buyers can get Gear VR for free.

USA TODAY's Ed Baig provides a first look at the new Samsung Gear 360 VR camera Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY

The phones run the Marshmallow version of Android. Good as the hardware is, you have to weigh whether you prefer Android or would rather go with the iOS software in the iPhones.

Along those lines, rumor has it Apple will be unveiling a smaller-display iPhone in a few weeks, but more than likely the next major iPhone upgrade wont come until September. Until then, the new Galaxys are the phones with extra fizz.

This new role is really a blessing, Ditka said in a statement released by ESPN. Its something I asked for. After many years of weekend travel, Im thrilled Ill get to watch NFL games on Sundays and Monday nights in the comfort of my own home. I enjoy being part of the game and part of ESPN. I really do. So this is a great solution.

The former coach signed a two-year extension with ESPN in his new role.

While ESPN insists that the move is voluntary, there have been questions about if Ditkas conservative views may have affected his role at the network.

Earlier this month, he called Barack Obama the worst President ever and said hed likely be voting for Trump. Curt Schilling was replaced on Sunday Night Baseball this season after a controversy in 2015 over offensive statements he made regarding some of his political views though he still appears on Monday Night Baseball.

Mike talked with me late in the year about his role for next season, Seth Markman, ESPNs senior coordinating producer, NFL studio shows said. Thankfully we were able to come to an agreement that works for him and keeps him a part of our ESPN family.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The real Trump tax scandal,"['Est March', 'David Cay Johnston', 'P M']","Our system lets wealthy people delay IRS payments, invest the money and make a killing.

Site of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)

Theres a big story in the tax returns that Donald Trump claims he cannot release because of what he describes as a routine audit. The big story is not the true size of his wealth, but about how Congress has turned the income tax into a source of massive wealth for many of the richest Americans, including Trump.

That may seem hard to believe because the income tax burdens most of us. But the riches to be mined from the tax code are well known to Americas top tax lawyers and their clients.

Since 1986, Congress has accomplished what medieval alchemists and Sir Isaac Newton could not in their quest for a philosophers' stone that they believed would transform lead into gold. Our lawmakers have magically transformed income taxes into a source of wealth for many in the donor class by adding just a few lines to the nearly 6,500-page Internal Revenue Code .

It's all about tax rules that require you to depreciate, or reduce, the value of buildings over time, even if the market value of the structures is going up. If your depreciation is greater than your traditional income from work and businesses, Congress lets you report negative income. If these paper losses are just a dollar more than traditional income, it wipes out your income taxes for the year.

If Trump's returns show he has paid no income taxes in some years, that could be a reason he has not yet released details.

Congress says most Americans can deduct no more than $25,000 of real estate depreciation against their income. But if you work two days a week managing real estate and own enough that the depreciation exceeds your salary and other income, Congress lets you live income-tax-free. And for as long as you keep buying buildings and depreciating them, the tax does not come due.

A decade after Trump graduated from college, he enjoyed a luxurious bachelor lifestyle in Manhattan while paying no income taxes. Depreciation on his buildings let him tell the IRS that his 1978 income was negative by $406,379. The next year, it was negative $3.4 million, according to documents I found in casino regulatory files.

To understand how reporting a negative income can be profitable, take a look at your pay stub. If Congress gave you a deal similar to Trumps, instead of the government deducting taxes from your paycheck, you would keep that money  like an interest-free loan  and could use it to make more money.

Invest that money at 5% and then pay the tax 20 years later. For each dollar of tax, you'd pocket $1.65. Net 10%, and youd pocket $5.73 for each tax dollar you didnt pay.

Trump in 2011 claimed that NBC paid him $65 million a year for The Apprentice, a figure the network called grossly inaccurate. Lets go with Trumps number and assume he reports a negative income that year through the magic of depreciation. The federal income tax escaped on his Apprentice haul would be almost $23 million. Trump claims he is a world-class investor, so assume he earns 10% interest on it. After 20 years, that $23 million tax burden would be transformed into a $130 million net gain.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

About 2.1 million taxpayers report negative incomes annually, IRS data show. The IRS knows, but wont say, how many of those are failed small business owners and how many are rich landlords like Trump. Congress has not asked.

That is not the only way the super rich are allowed to defer income taxes and profit from the money until its due. Another rule lets managers of private equity and hedge funds defer taxes on unlimited amounts for as long as they choose. And still another allows executives delay until retirement much more of their income taxes than ordinary people.

The big story in Trumps tax returns is that Congress has created two income tax systems, separate and unequal. One system burdens most Americans. The other enriches the donor class.

An audit is no reason for Trump to withhold his tax returns. Releasing them does not affect the IRS, and the agency has already said nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information. Moreover, Trump has no excuse for holding back tax returns from years no longer under audit.

It has been traditional for many years for presidents and candidates to release their tax returns. As of Sunday, of the two Democrats and four Republicans still in the presidential race, Trump was the only holdout.

Trump promotes himself as a champion of people whom he says Washington politicians and the donor class ignore. He could bolster that position by revealing his tax returns so we can determine how much of his wealth comes from his business acumen and how much from congressional tax favors.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Only the NFL grind could stop Calvin Johnson,"['Est March', 'P M', 'Jarrett Bell']","Six-time Pro Bowl selection finishes with 83 TDs and 11,619 yards on 731 career catches, including 122 receptions for a record 1,964 yards in 2012. USA TODAY Sports

Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson (81) after the game against the Green Bay Packers at Ford Field. (Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports)

When word circulated a few weeks ago that Calvin Johnson was on the verge of hanging it up, it was natural to connect the dots to Detroit Lions legend Barry Sanders.

Like Johnson, who officially retired Tuesday, Sanders was 30 when he played his final NFL season.

And like Megatron, Sanders didnt come close to sniffing a championship with the franchise that Id swear is still reeling from the effects of the Bobby Layne Curse.

Youd think that would be enough to influence Johnsons decision.

Since joining the Lions as the No. 2 pick overall in 2007  no, not all of Matt Millens moves as general manager were horrendous  Johnson produced more 100-yard games than any receiver in the game. He broke Jerry Rices NFL single-season record with 1,964 receiving yards in 2012. And in a 134-game career, he averaged 86.1 yards per game  more than any receiver who has ever played at least 100 games.

So the Canton credentials are intact.

But Johnson, the best receiver of his era, will also go down, like Sanders, as one of the greatest players in NFL history to never win a crown.

About a year before Sanders retired in 1999, I remember being stunned when he told me that he had never won a championship on any level  not in high school, or even in pee wee football. It weighed on him. Then they dismantled his O-line, and he bolted.

Johnson endured an 0-16 season with the Lions in 2008. He played on teams that just had two winning seasons  and zero playoff victories -- in his nine years in Detroit.

That in itself might have been reason enough to call it a career.

Yet Johnsons case is deeper than that. It was the physical grind that apparently clinched the decision.

Evidenced by the career-low 13.8 yards per catch last season, Johnsons body is not what it used to be. The routes werent as crisp. The acrobatics came in flashes rather than flurries. The dominance waned.

His cool nickname, Megatron, reflects a powerful, resilient machine. But in real life, Johnson is a real person who battled ankle, knee and other assorted injuries in recent years that took such a toll that he told family and select teammates several months ago that the 2015 season would be his last. He made up his mind a long time ago, then took the past few weeks to confirm it, while the Lions kept their fingers crossed that hed change his mind.

A few days before Super Bowl 50, one of Johnsons former teammates, ex-receiver Nate Burleson, told me, Hes tired...It could be fatigue.

Burleson, who played four of his 11 NFL seasons opposite Johnson in Detroit, clearly knew the gist of the issue.

The fan in me wants to see him play forever, Burleson, now an analyst for the NFL Network, told USA TODAY Sports. But ... its difficult to keep carrying a team on your back, year after year, when your body is beat up and it takes more and more time to recover.

A signature Megatron highlight?

Ill go with the grab at JerryWorld in 2011, when the Lions overcame a 27-3 deficit against the Dallas Cowboys and Matthew Stafford fired a 23-yard pass into double coverage. That was the season that Stafford threw for over 5,000 yards, and it seemed like a third of the yards came on throws to a heavily-covered Johnson, who somehow came down with the football.

That was part of their design: throw-it-up-and-let-Megatron-make-the-play. During the particular comeback at Dallas, Johnson quickly flicked his left hand  the signal -- as he sauntered toward the back of the end zone early in the fourth quarter. He positioned himself while draped by two defenders, and with a third DB closing in, Johnson went vertical and came down with the jump ball.

Of course, theres some more memorable footage that can be pulled from the archive  that controversial TD catch that wasnt in the end zone in Chicago in 2010, when Johnsons simultaneous grab, fall and celebration prompted referee Gene Steratore to rule it incomplete.

And thus, the Calvin Johnson Rule was born.

Johnson would hardly beat his chest about the fact that his name is commonly invoked in relation to an NFL rule. Shoot, if that were the case with Chad Ochocinco, wed have T-shirts and a marketing campaign.

But that isnt Johnsons style. Hes been one of the most low-keyed superstars Ive ever encountered; a man who carried himself with a reserved dignity that made it tough to get a read on the person outside of the game.

He was nobodys diva, just a consummate professional who put in the effort until it was time to go.

So, a day after the grand Peyton Manning press conference and weeks after Jared Allen posts a video of himself riding off into the overcast backdrop, Johnson made it official by releasing a statement.

Like Sanders, who announced his retirement by faxing a statement to his hometown newspaper in Wichita, Kan., Johnson fittingly delivered one more message that was true to himself as he opted out.

The iconic producer, Apple Music radio host and Snapchat extraordinaire appeared on Wednesday's segment, and clarified his role within hip-hop now that hes no longer relegated to hollering We the best! on tracks (because it just goes without saying these days).

""Im a music mogul, Im a producer, Im a DJ, Im an executive, Im a CEO, and Im an artist,"" he shared, referencing some of the hit records hes produced, including Im On One, All I Do Is Win and Hold You Down. ""I am like the hip-hop Quincy Jones, you know what Im saying? But, you know, Im a CEO too. You know, Im an entrepreneur. Im a young mogul. Im blessed.""

Khaled then shared a major key. More than eating breakfast or drowning watering your plants or slathering yourself in cocoa butter, Khaled urged Ellen  and viewers  to stay away from ""they.""

""'They' is the person who told you you would never have The EllenShow,"" Khaled explained to Ellen. ""'They' is the person that doesnt believe in you, that (says) that you won't succeed. You know, they never wanted me on The EllenShow and, look at me, Im on The EllenShow! And this (is) the number one show. Mama, I made it!""

Before Ellen congratulated Khaled with a chain, T-shirt and a courtesy Snap, the mogul also revealed that he's changed... A LOT.

""Success don't come overnight,"" he said. ""This is 25 years of blood, sweat and tears.""

If you missed out, heres For The Wins comprehensive guide of the program thats been called the best television show ever featuring an Olympic gold medalist looking for love and catchphrases amid a haze of flip cup and bro-dom. We called it that. Just now. Jeah.

How long did it take in the episode Lochte to:

... say jeah  1 minute.

... look confused  1 minute.

... make the declarative statement that its his world  2 minutes.

... appear shirtless  2 minutes.

... discuss peeing in the pool  2 minutes.

... wink non-ironically at the camera  2 minutes.

... name his group of friends the Lochtourage  3 minutes.

... do push-ups while another man sits on his back  3 minutes.

... enter a party by popping out of a doorway and saying what up, what up, are we gonna turn it up tonight?  4 minutes.

... refer to a group of women as ladies  5 minutes.

... talk to some ladies while producers played 70s porn music  6 minutes.

... get shot down after asking a girl out and promising to pay for dinner  8 minutes.

... skateboard off the back of a jeep like Marty McFly in Back to the Future 10 minutes. (Note: It wasnt Lochte, of course. Maybe of course gives him too much credit. But anytime someone pulls a McFly, it gets noted for the history books.)

... hug a foreign love interest thats introduced via a black-and-white flashback that conspicuously doesnt show her face  12 minutes.

... appear in underwear  14 minutes.

... go on a date with a young woman who clearly hadnt thought this through  18 minutes.

... appear in a painters hat  25 minutes.

Screenshot that best encapsulates the show:

Conversation that best encapsulates the show:

Lochte: What kind of movie do you guys want to watch.

Lochtes sister: Silence of the Lambs.

Lochte: Were not watching no scary movies.

Lochtes other sister: Dumb and Dumber.

I think youre more than capable of figuring it out where it went from there. (Also, timely movie selections, Lochte family. Did they go to Blockbuster to rent these movies on VHS?)

Things you learned from the show:

Ryan Lochte has more friends than you and they like to play shirts and skins everything.

In the most unexpected thing ever, Ryan Lochte isnt the member of his family most likely to wear a tuxedo T-shirt. (His brother, Devon.)

In the most predictable thing ever, Lochtes older sister doesnt approve of his usual girlfriends.

Lochte doesnt know how many medals he won in London.

He drinks Corona on first dates and goes out with women who drink Cosmos on theirs.

One of his favorite movies is What Women Want, the Mel Gibson movie where a man gets the supernatural ability to read womens minds. (Lochte didnt pluralize the second word and called the movie What Woman Want.) Everything you need to know about Ryan Lochte is summed up by his obvious belief that announcing he likes What Women Want will make women think hes a sensitive man who is attune to all the needs  physical, mental and/or sensual  of the modern female.

For all his Lochte-ness, he genuinely seems to love his family. You hear that ladies? Hes the whole package and, as a bonus, hell let you pick any movie, as long as it stars Helen Hunt and isnt scary.

Catchphrase count (approximate):

Jeah!  19

Group Jeahs!  1

Turn it up!  4

TURRRRRN ITTTT UUUUPPPP!  1

I love you. Youve gotta work on bowling.  To his sister after bowling.

Man, she is sex  shes beautiful.  He was trying to say sexy, but stopped himself mid-syllable

usatoday.com,,The IKEA Kitchen Sale Is Happening Right Now,[],"Each year, IKEA holds kitchen sales events that deliver a significant discount on your total purchase. This year's sale just kicked off, and if youre in the market for a new kitchen, now's the time to shop.

But dont delay. Planning and mapping out a new kitchen takes time, especially if you want to use IKEAs in-house kitchen planning services, and the sale only runs through Sunday, April 17, 2016.

In the past, IKEAs kitchen events occurred two or three times a year, according to a salesperson we spoke to. But its been a year since the last sale, and it may be that these promotions will be held only annually going forward.

This years kitchen event promises a 15 percent rebate in the form of an IKEA gift card when you spend $4,000 or more on a new kitchenthat is, the frames, doors, hinges, drawers, integrated lighting, and appliances. That's a big change from previous years, when the discount came straight off your bill.

But if you like IKEAs style and quality, this shouldn't be a dealbreaker. For frequent IKEA shoppers, spending a rebate of $600 or more on utensils, glassware, and furniture wont be difficult.

MORE IKEA COVERAGE

IKEA isnt well-known for selling appliances, though its products are made by reputable third-party manufacturers like Whirlpool. For the kitchen sale, appliances will count towards the $4,000 threshold for the rebate. This fact isnt spelled out on the companys website or in its leaflets, but a salesperson assured us they are eligible. However, kitchen furniture and accessories like utensils and glassware aren't eligible.

Credit: IKEA

In 2015, IKEA ended production of its popular Akurum kitchen cabinet system. More than 7.7 million Akurum cabinets were sold following their debut in 1995, according to IKEA. Taking its place is the Sektion model, which carries over Akurums soft-close drawers and doors, wall-mounted rail systems, and 25-year warranty.

But the two products are not compatible. Sektion is a more modular system, maximizing cabinet interior space and utilizing a wall-mounted rail system for installing both upper and lower cabinetssomething that makes the DIY process easier.

Before setting an appointment with an IKEA designer, be sure to take careful measurements of your kitchen layout. Use IKEAs planning tools to get the ball rolling. Bring photos of your existing kitchen, along with any blueprints you might have.

The Fine Print

There are some details to be aware of before jumping in the car and heading off to your local store.

First, as mentioned above, to meet the $4,000 minumum purchase you must buy products in the right categories. These include frames, doors, hinges, drawers, integrated lighting, and appliances. Other kitchen-related productslike furniture, glasses, plates, and flatwaredo not count towards the rebate.

Second, the rebate is for a single purchase of $4,000 worth of qualifying kitchen-related goods, not including tax or shipping. If you purchase IKEAs Individual Kitchen Planning service ($199) it cannot be applied toward the $4,000 threshold, though it will be rebated in full on your gift card if you do meet the minimum.

Finally, Though it's available online and in every other U.S. retail store, the kitchen offer is not valid at IKEAs Portland, Oregon, location. Go figure.",[]

KitchenAid says the new model is 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter, yet still large enough to mix and knead ingredients for up to five dozen cookies or a loaf of bread.

Best of all, the Mini tops out at 12.3 inches, almost 2 inches shorter than other Artisan models.

Credit: KitchenAid KitchenAid's Artisan Mini (left) won't be able to mix as much cookie dough as the 5- or 6-quart models, but how much do you really need to make, anyway?

While hand mixers are adequate for most tasks, a stand mixer is ideal for heavy-duty mixingespecially for pastas and bread dough. The downside of stand mixers (for the occasional baker) is that theyre heavy (typically about 25 pounds) and large. And at $350 and up for the cheapest KitchenAid models, theyre an investment in both counter space and cash.

Nevertheless, KitchenAids timeless styling and bouquet of colors have made its mixer a status symbol of sorts for home chefs. Shaving a couple inches off its height means the Mini can now go where earlier models couldn'tnamely, under low-hanging cabinets.

The smaller size doesn't come with many other tradeoffs. Like all other Artisan-series mixers, the Mini offers 325 watts of horsepower for heavy-duty work. Better still, it will be compatible with all of KitchenAid's optional attachments, from sausage and pasta makers to slicers and juicers.

One thing that wont be much smaller is the price. The MSRP for the Artisan Mini Stand Mixer will be $399.99, down from $429.99 for the next larger model. KitchenAid says it will be available beginning in June 2016.

KitchenAid also took the opportunity to announce other additions to its stand mixer line, including a textured ceramic bowl and upgrades to the spiralizer, pasta press, and pasta roller and cutter attachments. To top things off, six new colors and finishes will be joining the companys lineup this summer, including Hot Sauce, a fiery red that will be one of 10 colors offered for the Artisan Mini Stand Mixer.",[]

WASHINGTON  The Army misled Congress and taxpayers when it said it had killed in 2014 a program that embedded social scientists with combat units, according to a congressman, a Defense official and Army documents.

Last year, the Army said it had terminated the controversial battlefield anthropology program, known as the Human Terrain System, which had been plagued by documented time sheet fraud, racism and sexual harassment. It is not clear why the Army said the program was dead, according to a Defense Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the program.

Not only is the Human Terrain System alive, the official said, but the Army could expand it if more money becomes available.

Its continued existence and potential expansion outraged Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a member of the Armed Services Committee.

Its absolutely astonishing that the Army wants to convince itself that it never killed HTS after it was publicly acknowledged that the program was done, Hunter said. Even if true, that the program was never killed, the Army was happy with members of Congress and the scientific community thinking and believing it was killed. The Army is evidently OK with taking people for fools.

The Human Terrain System remains a program of record, which means it is designated to receive funding for years to come, the official said. Its current budget is about $1.2 million per year and employs two Army officers, two civilian employees and five contractors. Though there is no longer a requirement to deploy social scientists to battlefields, commanders have stated a need for social and cultural information in areas that they operate, the official said.

The program has spent more than $725 million since 2007, according to budget documents. Peak spending came in 2010 when the Army doled out $159 million as it rapidly expanded the effort during the height of the counterinsurgency wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Contractors trained civilians with degrees in social science on how to advise commanders on avoiding needless fighting and on targeting aid to local populations.

A USA TODAY investigation of the program, based on Army documents and interviews, found multiple problems. Many commanders scoffed at the reports from the teams and often relegated them to bases. Some team members were paid $280,000 annually for work that investigators suspected had never been done. A 2010 Army investigation concluded that the program had been fraught with waste, fraud and abuse.

The American Anthropological Association, the world's largest organization of the field's scholars, condemned the program at its outset for putting at risk its social scientists and the people they surveyed. Anthropologists could be used by the military to target insurgents, a violation of their ethics not to harm those whom they study, according to the association.

In light of the problems found in 2010, the Army required training on filling out time sheets, and fired personnel found to have been harassing trainees. Last year, then-Army Secretary John McHugh praised the program for providing information that was actionable and useful for decision-making.

However, the Army also announced in 2015 that the Human Terrain System had been terminated in 2014 as there was no longer a requirement for HTS teams in theater.

But documents obtained by USA TODAY show that Army officials had simply changed the programs emphasis from deploying social scientists with troops to providing information to commanders from a group of experts based at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. They also began referring to the program as the Global Cultural Knowledge Network.

The Global Cultural Knowledge Network, the Defense official, is not a replacement for the Human Terrain System but a part of it.

Internal documents and emails show that officials at Leavenworth were aware of the controversy surrounding the Human Terrain System, how it could attract critics and what could be done to silence them. One memo instructs staff on how to create a presentation about the Global Cultural Knowledge Network that anticipated Evil People Questions.

Smells like HTS? the document asks. How...is this different.

At another point, the memo calls for staff to show how the Army's social science expertise is better for soldiers than other government sources or ""any number of sites that I can Google?""

Email traffic also showed concerns about Hunters involvement and the need for the Army to influence him. An adviser on the program counseled top officials at Leavenworth that work clearly needs to be done to, if not change Congressman Hunter's mind, then at least move him into the neutral category for future endeavors.

The documents show that the Army was trying to trick critics into thinking the program had been killed, Hunter said.

They reinvented HTS in the form of GCKN, and only now that theyre called on it are they saying that HTS never went away, Hunter said. So now there are two programs, constituting more waste and more opportunity for fraud. Theyre wasting money and drawing attention away from other priorities, which disadvantages the men and women who serve in the Army. Thats a shame.

Hunters chief of staff, Joe Kasper, said the congressman is still waiting to hear from the Army about questions he has raised about the program.

That is one response that Rep. Hunter is salivating to receive, Kasper said. Either the Army takes ownership of its mistake and we work to a solution or we ratchet up the fight. Either way, this is one issue that certainly wont wither on the vine.

The remark came from Texas Rep. Myra Crownover (R-Denton) during a hearing on sexual assault held by the Texas House Committee on Higher Education, reported The Dallas Morning News,

I was listening for mention of drug or alcohol abuse and, you know, I think those two conversations are so intertwined. I would be curious to see how many times a pure, sober sexual assault happened, Crownover reportedly said during the hearing. She added, The best defense is being sober.

The hearing was scheduled, among other things, to make recommendations toward the prevention and elimination of sexual assault on college campuses.

Crownover later defended herself on Twitter and in a statement to The Dallas Morning News, saying her quote was taken out of context.

Let me be clear, whether or not a sexual assault victim was intoxicated does NOT condone or excuse the actions of the other party.  Myra Crownover (@MyraCrownover) March 8, 2016

Let me be clear, whether or not the victim of a sexual assault was intoxicated does not mitigate, condone or excuse the actions of the other party. However, I do not think we can properly address the issue of sexual assault on college campuses without also discussing the role drugs and alcohol play in this important issue, Crownover said.

Grace Gilker, a student and director of the Womens Resource Agency at University of Texas Austin, told the Daily Texan, Shes right in the sense that alcohol is the number one date rape drug, but I think the extent to which she connected substances and sexual assault is problematic and borders on victim blaming. Furthermore, the word choice of pure in describing a sexual assault does not sit well with me.

Other people were also were far from satisfied. Twitter lit up with responses like these:

usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Brock Osweiler agrees to deal with Texans,"['Est March', 'Lorenzo Reyes', 'P M']","Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler (17) looks to pass the ball during the first half against the Oakland Raiders at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. (Photo: Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports)

The NFL is all about quarterbacks, and free agency is no different. As the new NFL league year begins Wednesday, the QB market is expected to take shape. Until then, here is the latest that is happening with the top quarterbacks on the market:

Brock Osweiler

Contender: Texans

Osweiler has agreed to terms with the Houston Texans. ESPN's Adam Schefter says the deal is for $72 million over four years.

The NFL world goes: WOW.

He was the biggest domino on the market and now there will be a ripple effect throughout the rest of the NFL

The Texans have a very good defense and made the playoffs despite below-average quarterback play. Coach Bill OBrien and Houston were poised to offer a more lucrative deal than Denver, and according to NFL Network, it came down to those two teams.

The Broncos, who hadnt had talks with Osweilers agent Jimmy Sexton since they made their three-year offer last week, were in negotiations with him today, trying to prevent him from hiting the open market.

Ryan Fitzpatrick

Contenders: Jets and Broncos

Now that Osweilers deal is reportedly done, Fitzpatrick coould be the next piece to fall into place. He threw for career highs in passing yards (3,905) and touchdowns (31) in his one season with the Jets. Because of his familiarity with offensive coordinator Chan Gailey, Fitzpatricks best fit is clearly with the Jets, but Fitzpatrick chas decided to test the market.

Fitzpatrick, 33, is represented by the same agent as Osweiler, Jimmy Sexton. Could that mean that Sexton could now try to sell Denver on Fitzpatrick?

Colin Kaepernick

Contenders: 49ers and Broncos

Now that Osweiler is headed to Houston, NFL Network is reporting that Plan B is for Denver is to make a strong push to trade for Kaepernick, who is reportedly unhappy in San Francisco and requested to be traded. Kaepernick is under contract, so the 49ers control his rights, but new coach Chip Kelly may not want a disgruntled player in the locker room.

According to Bleacher Report, however, the 49ers are not interested in trading Kaepernick.

Robert Griffin III

Contenders: 49ers, Jets and Rams

Another case in point for the ripple effect is Griffin. With Osweiler headed to the Texans, RGIII suddenly becomes a more appealing player - Schefter said the former Redskins QB was on the Broncos' radar. If Denver can't execute a trade for Kaepernick, San Francisco may be interested in taking a low-risk flier on RGIII to see if he can fit in with Kellys scheme and compete with incumbent projected starter Blaine Gabbert for playing time.

Los Angeles, which is beginning the offseason program with Case Keenum as the starter, may also be interested in adding Griffin to create more competition.

Case Keenum and Nick Foles

According to USA TODAY Sports Tom Pelissero, the Rams placed a first-round restricted free agent tender, which means that if another team goes after him, they will need to forfeit a first-round draft pick to Los Angeles. With the Broncos having a clear need at quarterback, this protects that player that coach Jeff Fisher has said will enter the offseason as the starter. Keenum previously played for Kubiak with the Texans.

Johnny Manziel

Contenders: Undetermined

Hes expected to be released either sometime around the start of the new league year. Although his 2016 salary becomes fully guaranteed at 4 p.m., if he is suspended because of an ongoing domestic violence investigation taking place in Texas, the Browns could try to recuperate some money.

If and when Manziel hits the market, teams may keep distance because of the open investigation, as well as other off-field concerns that have emerged this offseason.

Chase Daniel

Signed with the Philadelphia Eagles to reunite with his former offensive coordinator from the Kansas City Chiefs, Doug Pederson, who is the new head coach of the Eagles. Terms were initially unavailable.

Mark Sanchez

Contenders: Undetermined

With Daniel signing in Philadelphia, the Eagles may be interested in moving Sanchez in a trade. Maybe Dallas or Indianapolis as a backup?

Matt Hasselbeck

Announced his retirement and will join ESPN as an analyst.

usatoday.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Viking to add just two new river ships in 2017,"['Gene Sloan', 'Est March', 'P M']","Viking River Cruises (Photo: Viking River Cruises)

AMSTERDAM -- The rapid expansion of Viking River Cruises is finally coming to an end -- at least for now.

Speaking at a christening event last week in Amsterdam, Viking chairman and CEO Torstein Hagen said the company would add just two new ships on European waterways in 2017 -- far fewer than in recent years.

Viking needs to absorb the massive capacity increases of recent years that have catapulted it to a dominant position in the business, Hagen suggested.

""We probably (have) a couple ships too many this year, quite frankly,"" Hagen told cruise writers at a press conference before the unveiling of six new river ships for 2016.

Four of the six new vessels will sail on the Rhine, Main and Danube river system. The other two are heading to the Seine in France. Later this month, Viking will add a seventh new ship for 2016 on Portugal's Duoro River.

Including the newcomers, Viking will have 56 vessels operating on European rivers this year, more than the next three largest North American-focused river lines combined. The company has pulled away from its rivals in size with the unveiling of more than 40 new ships since 2013. Last year alone saw it add 14 vessels.

North American demand for river cruises in Europe has been exploding over the past few years, driven in no small part by a massive marketing campaign by Viking, which now carries nearly 50% of the North Americans cruising on Europe's rivers. But several recent events in Europe including the November terrorist attacks in Paris and violence involving the waves of migrants arriving from the Middle East have turned some Americans skittish on traveling to the continent.

Hagen said demand for river cruising in Europe took a particularly huge hit in the wake of the November attacks and only now is recovering. Bookings at Viking plunged 58% in the weeks following the incident as Americans backed off from planning trips not just to France but to the entire continent, he said.

Viking reacted to the downturn by loosening booking terms and lowering fares for solo travelers, which has brought customers back to the table, Hagen said. The company saw a record booking day early last week with $25 million in sales, he noted.

Demand for Viking river cruises also has been affected by regular customers foregoing a river cruise this year to try out the company's new ocean ships, Hagen said.

Still, long term, the growth of river cruising in Europe is far from done, Hagen suggested.

""I think we'll get back to a faster growth,"" he said. The slowdown in demand ""is related to these events. It will accelerate back.""

LOS ANGELES  For most of his life, Michael Phelps chased the next thing. The next meet. The next race. The next record. The next gold medal.

He did it better than most, certainly better than any Olympic athlete ever has. It made him an international icon, not to mention a very wealthy man.

But happy? That was the one thing that proved maddeningly elusive, and never did it seem further away than that night 18 months ago when Phelps was busted for drunk driving.

Turns out, however, that winding up in jail was the key to setting Phelps free.

Im just living a freer, happier life now, and I think its something that is a huge change, he said Tuesday night at the U.S. Olympic Committees media summit.

I dont feel like Im carrying weights around anymore. Whatever Id been holding inside of me, I was able to get it out and was able to start fresh, and thats a pretty incredible feeling.

It only takes a few minutes of listening to Phelps to see that he is, finally, a man at peace. Oh, hes still as driven as ever, admitting its kind of annoying to be going on seven years without swimming a personal best.

But there is a calmness to him now, a self-assuredness that comes with knowing the person he is outside the pool is as good as the one in it.

Im not sure the world has seen who I am, Phelps said. I think youve seen me as a swimmer, but not at all as a person. This is an opportunity for me to be myself and, to be quite honest, you have whatever opinion you have of me and thats fine. I am who I am and Im not sugar coating.

Hes not hiding anymore, either.

Like most elite athletes, Phelps learned long ago he had to compartmentalize his life. The demands of training and competing are so rigorous that the only way to survive is to break things into hours and days, personal and professional, the long term and the short term.

But it was an avoidance tactic, as well. The anger at his absentee father, his emotions, the friends and family who wanted him to be as engaged in his personal life as he was in the pool  all of it was pushed to the back of his mind and promptly forgotten.

Nothing stays buried forever, however, and Phelps 2014 stay in rehab forced him to finally confront all those things hed been avoiding.

I think you saw how difficult it was to not share anything for so many years, Phelps said, smiling slightly when someone asked if the introspection was difficult.

When I look in the mirror, Im still the same person but how I approach things is a little different, he said. Im a lot more laid back, Im a lot more open. I keep the most important people closer to me than I ever have before. I actually pick up the phone when somebody calls  thats a big change.

Im just more engaged in everything I do in my life.

Including swimming.

Its mind-boggling to imagine, but Phelps and coach Bob Bowman now say he became the most decorated Olympian of all time at the 2012 Games despite a training regimen that was chaotic, to say the least.

You could barely get me to the pool, Phelps said.

Though Phelps won six medals in London, four of them gold, he knew he hadnt honored the process. As he looked ever more inward, he knew there would come a time when he would regret that.

So when he got back in the pool and realized that, for the first time in years, he was enjoying being there, he decided to right that one remaining wrong.

I wanted to do it the way I should have done it in 2012. I wanted to prepare for an Olympic Games like I should have, Phelps said. ... Twenty years later, if Id looked back to London, I think I would have been disappointed with myself and ... thats something I never wanted to live with.

At 30, Phelps knows there are no guarantees. But 18 months without alcohol has left him in perhaps the best shape of his life, chiseled and clear-headed, and he knows he has put the work in.

No matter what happens in Rio in August, or at the Olympic trials in Omaha, Neb., in June, Phelps is content in knowing there will be no What ifs?

If I go to Rio and dont final, Id probably be a little pissed, but thats what I had. And I think at that point, Id be able to accept it, he said. Thats where Im in a different state of mind than I was four years ago and I was eight years ago.

Despite saying it before, Phelps insists this will be his final act. He and fiancee Nicole Johnson are expecting their first child, a son, this spring, and Phelps relishes the idea of his firstborn being there for his last race.

He wants to be a dad, Phelps says when asked his plans for the rest of his life, being present for both the milestones and the mundane of parenthood.

Hes sure hell stay involved in swimming, but it will no longer be the driving force in his life.

When Johnson and Phelps were getting ready to move to Scottsdale, Ariz., last year, he was packing up his medals when the enormity of what hes accomplished finally hit him.

""I was looking at the medals and I was like, `Wow, thats pretty cool, Phelps said. For the first time, I was able to look back at my career and be really excited and be proud of what I did. Because I never had the chance to do that before.

There are still races to be swum. But for Michael Phelps, the chase is finally over.",[]

Peeple, the controversial app described as Yelp for humans, launched this week on Apple's App Store.

Peeple bills itself as a reputation app, where users can give recommendations about people and receive them from others. Users choose one of three types of recommendations: personal, professional and dating.

When details of Peeple were initially revealed in October, app creators Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough allowed users to leave recommendations about people who weren't on the service. Also, positive reviews would immediately appear, while negative reviews carried a 48-hour waiting period before publishing to give the user time to respond. The app was quickly slammed for the potential harm of these ratings.

According to a FAQ on Peeple's website, users will have more control over personal recommendations made by others. ""If you dont approve a recommendation you can easily delete it,"" reads an excerpt from Peeple's website. ""Remember, recommendations never go live on your profile without your permission.""

The app for iOS is available now, and will launch on Android later this year.

(Photo: Timothy T. Ludwig, USA TODAY Sports)

The Giants were serious about adding Olivier Vernon.

And they dug deep in their wallets to prove it. Really deep.

They signed Vernon to a massive five-year deal worth $85 million, $52.5 million of which are guaranteed, according to contract figures obtained by Tom Pelissero of USA TODAY Sports.

Consider this: The deal makes Vernon the highest-paid defensive end in the NFL -- above even J.J. Watt of the Houston Texans.

Vernon had received the transition tag from the Miami Dolphins, his former team, earlier in the week, but the franchise rescinded that offer after it added defensive end Mario Williams in free agency. The Dolphins will now receive a compensatory pick for losing Vernon.

In his four seasons with the Dolphins, Vernon, 25, generated 29 sacks and became one of the top defensive ends in the AFC. Widely considered one of the top pass rushers available on the market, Vernon instantly becomes the man with the most pressure on the Giants roster to address their biggest weakness.

New Yorks defense ranked last in yards allowed (420.3 per game) and 30th in both points allowed (27.6 per game) and sacks (23). The defense was the main reason the Giants failed to claim the NFC East this year and sputtered to a 6-10 record that prompted former head coach Tom Coughlin to step down.

In his place, the team promoted former offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo to be Coughlins replacement and retained general manager Jerry Reese to fix the defense. He made sure to at least try in free agency.

Vernons addition may have been the biggest move of the day for the Giants, but it wasnt the only one.

A person close to the situation confirmed that New York also locked up cornerback Janoris Jenkins to a five-year contract worth $62.5 million, $28.8 million of which is guaranteed. The Giants also added nose tackle Damon Harrison, according to the NFL Network.

Wednesdays massive free agent haul is in addition to Tuesdays news that defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul was returning to the team on a one-year deal worth up to $10.5 million.

Former first lady Nancy Reagan, the indispensable partner and protector of the nation's 40th president who became a fierce advocate in the fight against the disease that stole him from her, has died, the Reagan Library announced on Sunday. She was 94.

""Her romance with Ronald Reagan was a storybook love story,"" said historian Douglas Brinkley, editor of The Reagan Diaries. ""She is the one who deserves credit for orchestrating the great legacy that is Ronald Reagan.""

""She was a true partner to the presidency,'' Anita McBride, a chief of staff to former first lady Laura Bush, said in an interview Sunday with CNN.

In a statement, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama said they were ""fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice"" when they arrived at the White House.

""Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here,"" they wrote. ""Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimers, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that in many ways the Reagan love story was ""classic Hollywood, but it was unmistakably human too. Hands intertwined, Nancy and Ron rose to the pinnacle of political power, weathered cancer and personal heartbreak, and braved the depths of Alzheimer's cold embrace  always together. I know every American felt Nancy's immense pain when she, kissing Ronnie's casket, mouthed a tearful farewell to the best friend she once said she couldn't imagine life without.""

Nancy Reagan often said, ""My life didn't really begin until I met Ronnie."" She will be buried beside him on a hilltop at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. There, at the president's funeral in June 2004, much of the world watched the tearful widow lean over his coffin to say farewell as the sun set over Simi Valley.

Gone was the so-called 'dragon lady' whom her press secretary, Sheila Tate, said could make the most powerful White House aide shake with fear. Nearly forgotten were the closets of designer gowns and cabinets of expensive china that she preferred, and for which she was criticized. Even her unblinking gaze of connubial adoration -- The Gaze, reporters called it -- that so annoyed feminists seemed forgiven.

In her place was a frail, barely 5-foot-4-inch bird of a woman who had spent a decade losing her great love to Alzheimer's disease, and who, after 52 years, had finally let him go.

She never stopped grieving. ""I miss him now more than I ever did,"" she told CNN's Larry King in June 2007. Despite a tight circle of friends and her work at the Reagan Library, ""I'm lonely because I don't have him.""

The Reagans' fierce devotion  their children complained they felt like outsiders in their own family  was legendary. It was also polarizing. She was criticized as an overzealous gatekeeper for her husband, who called her ""Mommie."" Yet some who knew them say the out-of-work actor who'd been divorced by his more famous first wife, Jane Wyman, might well have remained a Hollywood has-been had he not met a B-movie starlet named Nancy Davis.

""I don't think he would have ever got elected governor (or) president if she wasn't his wife,"" said Stuart Spencer, who managed Reagan's California and national campaigns. ""She was that important to him. She was the anchor.""

'I thought I married an actor'

In Hollywood or Washington or on the campaign trail, ""She was the perfect supporting actress in that she always made Ronnie look good,"" said Bob Colacello, author of Ronnie and Nancy Reagan: Their Path to the White House.

She was born Anne Francis Robbins in New York City on July 6, 1921, but later shaved two years off her age. Her father, Kenneth Robbins, was a used-car salesman who soon skipped out of his marriage and his daughter's life. Her mother was Edith Luckett, a stage actress. Silent movie star Alla Nazimova was godmother to the girl everyone knew as Nancy.

Divorced, Luckett toured in acting companies to earn money, leaving Nancy, then 2, with Luckett's sister in Bethesda, Md. She didn't retrieve her until six years later, when Luckett married prominent Chicago neurosurgeon Loyal Davis. The family settled down to a life of privilege at his home on tony Lake Shore Drive. Show business friends like ""Uncle"" Walter Huston and Spencer Tracy visited when they passed through town.

Tracy helped Nancy Davis, who had taken her adopted father's surname, get a screen test in Hollywood. She signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1949 and went on to appear in 11 movies. Most, she wrote in her memoir, My Turn, were ""best forgotten.""

She wrote that the two people who became the Reagans metafter she learned in 1949 that her name was on an industry blacklist of Communist sympathizers. Suspecting a mix-up with another Nancy Davis, she contacted the Screen Actors Guild for help. The union's president was Ronald Reagan. And, in a story varnished into lore by the Reagans, their meeting led to romance.

Reagan was on the downside of his acting career and on the rebound after Wyman divorced him and took custody of their children, Maureen and Michael. After an on-again, off-again courtship, he and Nancy were married in a private ceremony on March 4, 1952. Seven months later, daughter Patti was born.

""When I married Ronnie, I thought I married an actor,"" Reagan would write. They did co-star in the 1957 potboiler Hellcats of the Navy. By then, he was a spokesman for General Electric and learning he had a politician's gift of gab.

'She had one constituent'

Nancy Reagan had been the breadwinner for a short time, but eventually she gave up acting to stay home with Patti and son Ron, born in 1958. She had a new career: Ronnie.

""She had one constituent,"" said chief White House speechwriter Ken Khachigian, ""and that was Ronald Reagan.""

Nancy Reynolds, a former aide and close family friend, recalled traveling on a plane with Nancy Reagan a few weeks after her husband was elected governor of California in 1966. A man behind them was griping about Reagan's stance in a budget battle in Sacramento. ""She pushed her seat back, looked him right in the eye and said, 'That's my husband you are talking about and you don't have the facts straight,'"" Reynolds recalled. ""Then she clicked the button that brought the seat up. She wasn't shy.""

As a newly hired speechwriter during the 1980 presidential campaign, Khachigian sat knee-to-knee with the Reagans in the backseat of a limousine. As the candidate known as ""The Great Communicator"" pored over his prepared speech, his wife told the aide, ""You need to know that Ronnie is best when he's stirring the emotions in his audience.""

If she knew her husband best, her ability to gauge others was keen, too. In his autobiography, An American Life, Ronald Reagan wrote that his wife ""was gifted with a special instinct that helped her understand the motives of some people better than I did.""

The president, whose 1984 re-election campaign theme was ""Morning in America,"" was ""a bit whimsical and liked people of all stripes and persuasions,"" Brinkley said. ""Nancy had a built-in danger detector. She would weigh in constantly on who to trust and who not to trust.""

Her antennae for those more interested in their own agenda than her husband's made her the unofficial White House ""personnel director,"" said Spencer, the campaign manager. ""He never fired anybody in his life. But she had no qualms about bringing the hammer down if they weren't doing the job right.""

That would become apparent in Reagan's second term. But in the first, it was Nancy Reagan who got clobbered by the media over her elegant tastes in a time of national belt-tightening.

'A new Jackie'

After the frugal Carter years of turned-down thermostats and cardigan sweaters, Nancy Reagan moved into the White House determined, as she later wrote, ""to reclaim some of the stature and dignity of the building.""

The first lady raised money to renovate the executive mansion, which had grown shabby. She ordered the first complete set of White House china since the Truman administration. She hosted lavish parties and 57 state dinners, inviting old Hollywood pals like Frank Sinatra and close friend Merv Griffin. Top fashion designers like Halston, Adolfo and Galanos provided her size 4 evening gowns, often in her signature ""Reagan Red.""

""She was so obviously trying to be a new Jackie (Kennedy) and restore the elegance and haute couture,"" said Kati Marton, author of Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History.

But times had changed. The country was in a recession.

Controversy greeted the Reagans' call for private donations to renovate the White House living quarters when it was disclosed amid an oil crisis that some of the money raised came from the energy industry. Although a private foundation footed the $200,000 bill for new dishes, the news broke the day the Agriculture Department promoted ketchup as a vegetable on kids' lunch plates. And the public didn't appreciate that Reagan failed to return expensive borrowed gowns and jewelry.

As more women entered the workforce, Reagan's total devotion to her husband seemed to some like a throwback to an earlier era, Colacello said. ""Her timing was wrong. She came in at the height of feminism, when things like china and fashion were passe."" A December 1981 Gallup poll showed Reagan was the least popular first lady since 1960.

Part of the first lady's problem, Colacello said, was that the media were unable to lay a glove on the ""Teflon president"" and instead ""took it out on Nancy."" (The president endorsed that theory.) Her ""Just Say No"" campaign against drugs became a punchline for late-night comics. Michael Deaver, a White House aide and one of Nancy Reagan's closest confidantes, wrote that she was the ""flypaper first lady.""

She earned ""a second beginning"" in the spring of 1982 when she staged a surprise performance at the Gridiron Dinner, the annual white-tie gathering of Washington's journalism and power elite. Wearing bag-lady clothes, fake pearls and a red straw hat, Reagan sang a parody called Second-Hand Clothes and topped it off by smashing a piece of china.

The skit won over skeptics. Reagan wrote: ""From that night on, my image began to change.""

Flynn as she arrives for a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial of her husband, former president Ronald Reagan, during the centennial birthday celebration at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif, on Feb. 6, 2011. (Photo: Richard Vogel, AP)

A mistake to underestimate her

Her Gridiron triumph was nearly a year to the day after she ""came within an inch of losing the man I love."" The March 30, 1981, assassination attempt on the president convinced her that ""I had to be more involved in seeing that my husband was protected in every possible way.""

After the shooting, ""her neurotic paranoia and need to control every detail of their lives really served her husband very well,"" Marton said. ""He could pretend nothing bothered him because he knew everything bothered her, and Nancy was eternally vigilant.""

One way was to consult an astrologer to help plan her husband's schedule. That riled Donald Regan, her husband's chief of staff in the second term. He also didn't like constant calls from the boss' wife. Regan, underestimating the power the first lady wielded, had even hung up on her.

That, said Khachigian, brought his downfall. ""What Mrs. Reagan said almost always reflected the president. People at their peril would think that the first lady was freelancing when she passed along a piece of advice or an instruction.""

She enlisted Washington power broker Robert Strauss and trusted White House aides to engineer Regan's ouster, made all the more urgent after the biggest scandal of her husband's presidency  the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal -- erupted on his watch.

""When Nancy was sidelined, that's when he got in trouble, like Iran-Contra under Don Regan,"" Marton said. ""She would have smelled trouble with Ollie North,"" the National Security Council staffer charged with illegally funneling money to Nicaraguan rebels.

Reagan had her own ideas for her husband's legacy. Marton said she was instrumental in encouraging detente with the Soviet Union, leading Reagan ""away from his 'evil empire' posture toward a role as a man of peace.""

""Even though she wasn't a policy person, she knew what was going on,"" White House aide James Kuhn said in a University of Virginia oral history interview. ""She had a major role in getting him to engage the Soviet Union. She was the one who worked on him the most, to open up his mind.""

After a second term that saw him survive colon cancer surgery and her undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer, the Reagans retired to their California ranch. It wasn't all that long after they left the White House that the former president began to show signs of Alzheimer's disease. In 1994, he wrote a letter to the American people to say he was withdrawing from public life.

""Finally she had her beloved Ronnie all to herself,"" Marton said, ""and basically he ceased to be who he had been. It was the greatest tragedy of her life.""

Over the next decade, the woman who had loved to travel became a full-time caregiver. She left their Bel Air home only on rare occasions, almost always to burnish his legacy, as when she christened the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. Sometimes Reagan, who for years fought off rumors of anorexia and whom Colacello said lived on Cobb salads and chocolate chip cookies, caught a quick lunch with friends at the Bel Air Hotel before rushing home to her husband.

As she watched her soulmate taken ""to a distant place where I can no longer reach him,"" Reagan spoke out in favor of embryonic stem cell research and its promise in treating Alzheimer's. That put her at odds with many, including President George W. Bush, in what had become ""the party of Reagan.""

Reagan's embrace of the stem-cell issue ""earned her a lot of credibility, the way she was willing to speak up for that and cut against the grain of the Republican Party,"" her son Ron, a liberal talk show host, told Colacello in a July 2009 Vanity Fair article.

When Obama reversed Bush's policy limiting federal dollars for research, Reagan issued a statement that she was ""very grateful"" and said, ""These new rules will now make it possible for scientists to move forward.""

Obama thanked Reagan but, to her and others' surprise, did not invite her to the White House announcement ceremony. ""Politically, it would have been a good thing for him to do,"" she later told Colacello in Vanity Fair. ""He could have gotten more mileage out of it.""

By then, the public that had seen her ""as the pampered, precious, self-indulgent first lady,"" Khachigian said, had changed its view. ""She became a much more sympathetic figure. She was not out flitting around and socializing. She was by (her husband's) side during a very difficult time. People saw she had qualities that they had overlooked.""

Among them was daughter Patti Davis, from whom she had been estranged for years. Nancy Reagan wrote in her 1989 memoir that she had probably been a better wife than mother and said, ""I hope and pray before my own life is over"" to reconcile with Patti.

Shortly before the former president was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she got her wish. The wildest of the four Reagan children, who had publicly derided her father's conservative views and written that her mother had abused her, moved back to Los Angeles in 1997 to be near her parents.

Before Ronald Reagan died, Davis said in a 2004 interview with NBC, he opened his eyes in ""this moment of just utter clarity looking straight at her. And he closed his eyes and he took his last breath.""

Nancy Reagan would live nearly a dozen more years. Occasionally, she appeared at events as her husband's standard-bearer, as at the 2008 GOP presidential debate at the library. That October, she fell and fractured her pelvis, forcing her to use a walker and then a cane.

She tried, as her deteriorating health allowed, to lead a full and meaningful life. Yet ""it was never the same for her"" after Reagan died, Reynolds said. ""She lost her true other half.""

Now, the two halves are whole again.

Good Guy ZacTM witnessed the tragic turn of events and offered to replace the device following this glorious op, which features Ahmed looking quite #unbothered and Zac looking like he hasnt even sniffed a carb in months.

Or, at least, be ready to foot a $949.99 bill, which Zac apparently did after their epic photograph.

Think of the next few weeks as a spring break for your DVR.

Oh, its not a completely work-free vacation. There are a few new shows that will merit recording attention, and a handful of returning shows  led by Foxs Empire and HBOs Game of Thrones, Veep and Silicon Valley  that will require you to re-engage your season passes. But otherwise, the torrent of attention-grabbing, time-consuming new series that has raged over broadcast, cable and streaming services this fall and winter is finally slowing to a somewhat more manageable flow.

And thank goodness for that.

Now, dont get me wrong: There is always room at the top. Certainly those of us who have lived through TV famine would be unwise to complain about a feast that has given this winter Emmy-worthy gems such as FXs The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, ABCs American Crime, BBC Americas London Spy and HBOs Vinyl.

Even so, you only have to look at the sinking ratings greeting so many series, new and old alike, to realize that supply has seriously outstripped demand. Or else the flood has at least splintered demand into so many pieces, its hard to imagine how suppliers are going to turn viewers into profits, which is the ultimate goal of the people who invest in the business side of show business.

But thats their problem. Our problem, aside from concerns that this boom is going to provoke an equally historic bust, is that at the moment, many of our DVRs are overwhelmed. (If youre still using a video recorder, well, good luck with that.) Yes, we still want something new; thats human nature. But having fewer new things demand our attention this spring may not be such a bad development.

After all, its almost spring. Surely theres something youve wanted to do outside that winter has delayed.

So what new shows should you watch when you come inside? Here are six choices.

Crowded (NBC, March 15)

NBC is pairing The Carmichael Show, a throwback to the days when sitcoms built episodes around issue debates, with this throwback to the days when NBC kept searching for a family sitcom that would be compatible with The Cosby Show or Friends. Produced by the folks behind the equally retro Hot in Cleveland, Crowded stars Patrick Warburton and Carrie Preston as parents whose dreams of an empty nest  and sex in the kitchen  are shattered when their two adult daughters move in with them, and their in-laws (Stacy Keach and Carlease Burke) refuse to move away. Despite the current-events overlay of jobless, homeless Millennials, Crowded feels decidedly old-fashioned: sort of Everybody Loves Raymond, if Ray and Debs kids had grown up. But old-fashioned is not necessarily bad, if its delivered by such solid pros as Warburton, Preston, Burke and Keach.

The Catch (ABC, March 24)

ABC has a slew of new shows coming this spring, most of which you can feel free to ignore. The Catch, however, has enough going for it behind and in front of the camera to merit a look. This flashy new series from Shonda Rhimess Shondaland stars a glammed-up Mireille Enos (The Killing) as a catcher of con men who is conned by her own fiance (Peter Krause). So between other cases, she and her team (which includes The L Words Rose Rollins) try to catch him and his team (which includes Losts Sonya Walger).

The Path (Hulu, March 30)

Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul makes a very welcome return to series television as a man who begins to question his faith in a Scientology-like cult  questions that may damage his relationship with his more committed wife (Michelle Monaghan) and, perhaps, threaten his well-being. The pilot hits a few too many familiar ""middle-aged man in emotional crisis"" notes, but the unusual setting and the strong cast (which includes Hugh Dancy) makes up for it.

Rush Hour (CBS, March 31)

Lets get this out of the way first: The pilot for this spinoff of the 1998 movie (and its sequels) is fairly terrible. But still, the premise is solid, the movie certainly was popular, and while Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are much missed, their replacements help maintain TVs welcome current embrace of inclusive casting. Plus its on CBS, which means the series will most likely get a sampling  and has a good chance of outlasting what are likely to be bad reviews. It may even surprise us and improve. Limitless did.

The Ranch (Netflix, April 1)

Some Netflix subscribers are probably most excited about the spring returns of Marvel's Daredevil and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. But for those who treasure, shall we say, unexpected casting, the show to watch for is The Ranch, which stars Ashton Kutcher as a failed pro football player who comes home to run the family ranch, much to the dismay of his brother  played by Kutchers That '70s Show co-star Danny Masterson. If thats not intriguing enough, consider their parents, played by Sam Elliott and Debra Winger. That may not be enough to get you to subscribe to Netflix, but if you already do, it should be enough to get you to hit play, at least once.

The Night Manager (AMC, April 19)

When it comes to pedigrees, its hard to top this six-part British import. Tom Hiddleston, Olivia Colman and  in a rare turn as a villain  Hugh Laurie star in this adaptation of the John le Carre novel about a British agent chasing after an evil arms dealer.

But heres our best guess at how each American League West team will line up from 1 to 9:

Houston Astros

2B Jose Altuve

RF George Springer

SS Carlos Correa

CF Carlos Gomez

3B Luis Valbuena

LF Colby Rasmus

DH Evan Gattis

1B Jon Singleton

C Jason Castro

The top of the Astros order stacks up favorably with any in the majors, but with so many free swingers, strikeouts will be plentiful for opposing pitchers. If Springer stays healthy, hes a threat for 30 homers and 30 steals. (He did it in the minors.)

FANTASY BASEBALL SLEEPERS: Top breakout picks for 2016

Gomez also lost significant time to injury, but hes close to 100% and still owns the power/speed skills that made him a first-round fantasy pick last spring. Meanwhile, Gattis had hernia surgery last month and might not be ready for opening day. Preston Tucker and Jake Marisnick could get more early-season at-bats as a result.

Singleton has his best chance for regular playing time if he makes consistent contact. If not, top prospect A.J. Reed isnt far away after hitting 34 homers at Class A and AA.

Los Angeles Angels

3B Yunel Escobar

RF Kole Calhoun

CF Mike Trout

1B Albert Pujols

DH C.J. Cron

LF Daniel Nava

C Carlos Perez

2B Johnny Giavotella

SS Andrelton Simmons

Quite possibly the team with the least depth, the Angels will rely heavily on Trout and Pujols to carry their offense. But Pujols, 36, is coming off foot surgery in November.

Free agent signee Escobar fills vacancies at leadoff and third base. Calhoun hit a career-high 26 homers last season, but his rising strikeout rate is a concern.

The biggest question is in left field, where Nava is battling Craig Gentry, minor leaguer Rafael Ortega and waiver pickup Todd Cunningham for at-bats after a proposed deal for the Toronto Blue Jays Michael Saunders fell through.

Oakland Athletics

CF Billy Burns

2B Jed Lowrie

RF Josh Reddick

LF Khris Davis

C Stephen Vogt

3B Danny Valencia

DH Billy Butler

1B Yonder Alonso

SS Marcus Semien

The As are the consensus choice to finish last in the AL West, but dont sell them short. Despite playing at a pitcher-friendly home park, they finished in the middle of the pack in offense last season.

AL East | Central | West

Burns is the catalyst after stealing 26 bases in 125 games. The additions of Lowrie, Davis and Alonso should make the lineup even better. Manager Bob Melvin will look to maximize platoon advantages and leverage the ability of Vogt, Valencia, 2B-OF Chris Coghlan and 1B-OF Mark Canha to play multiple positions. Vogt might not be ready to start the year because of arthroscopic elbow surgery in January.

Seattle Mariners

SS Ketel Marte

3B Kyle Seager

DH Nelson Cruz

2B Robinson Cano

1B Adam Lind

CF Leonys Martin

RF Seth Smith

C Chris Iannetta

LF Nori Aoki

The three major acquisitions on offense  Lind, Martin and Aoki  are left-handed hitters, so this lineup could have trouble when a southpaw is on the mound. Daily fantasy owners know how much Cruz loves to hit against lefties (.357/435/.673 last year), but hell need help from the platoon bats of Jesus Montero, Franklin Gutierrez and possibly Korean import Dae-ho Lee.

Except for a bit more power (21 homers), Canos numbers dropped from his first season in Seattle. After having sports hernia surgery, he should be 100% by opening day.

Texas Rangers

CF Delino DeShields

RF Shin-Soo Choo

1B Prince Fielder

3B Adrian Beltre

DH Mitch Moreland

LF Ian Desmond

2B Rougned Odor

SS Elvis Andrus

C Robinson Chirinos

DeShields was a terrific Rule 5 pickup last season who blossomed into a leadoff man, posting a .344 OBP and stealing 25 bases. Choo rebounded from a horrible start to become one of the majors most productive hitters after the All-Star break.

NL East | Central | West

Josh Hamiltons injury history spurred the Rangers to sign Desmond, who has made one start in the outfield in the majors. Moving from shortstop will help Desmonds value as long as he can rebound offensively.

If things dont work out, the Rangers have exciting outfield prospects Nomar Mazara and Lewis Brinson.",[]

Nasdaq (NDAQ) has agreed to a $1.1 billion acquisition of International Securities Exchange, the Deutsche Borse Group-owned operator of three electronic options exchanges, the U.S. financial trading company said Wednesday.

The cash and debt transaction would give Nasdaq ownership of three electronic options exchanges operated by the European company: ISE, ISE Gemini and ISE Mercury. Combined, the exchanges serve as the venue for more than 15% of trading in U.S. options, Nasdaq said in its announcement after financial markets closed.

As part of the transaction, Nasdaq is expected to gain an additional 20% stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, for a total 40% stake in the world's largest equity derivatives clearing company, and one of the largest horizontal clearinghouses.

Nasdaq said the deal is expected to improve its earnings per share within 12 months of finalization. Subject to customary closing`conditions, including regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, Nasdaq said.

""The equities options business has been core to our long-term strategy, and we believe an essential component to the strength of the Nasdaq franchise,"" Nasdaq CEO Bob Freifeld said in a statement issued with the deal announcement. He predicted the deal would enable the company to improve trading to clients ""while increasing operational efficiencies and decreasing operational costs.""

Merging the options operations will generate more competitive pricing and produce at least $40 million in annualized expense cost-savings within 18 months of the deal closing, said Tom Wittman, Nasdaq executive vice president and global head of equities.

Nasdaq scheduled a Thursday investor conference call at 8:15 a.m. EDT to discuss the transaction.

The deal announcement comes amid some recently announced consolidation plans for the financial exchange industry. The London Stock Exchange in February confirmed it was in talks about merging with Germany's Deutsche Borse.

Separately, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exhange, said this month that it is weighing a potential offer for the London Stock Exchange.

Langham Hotels and Resorts is expanding its presence in the USA, including the opening of its first true resort.

The Hong Kong-based company will open three new hotels in the continental USA: Langham Place, Wade Park in Frisco, Tex.; Langham Place, San Francisco; and The Langham, Bishops Lodge Santa Fe in New Mexico.

The New Mexico property will be the companys first resort.

We felt it was an important next step in our brand recognition, Robert Warman, chief executive officer of Langham Hospitality Group, parent company of Langham Hotels and Resorts, told USA TODAY.

Langham Hospitality Group, which also includes the Cordis and Eaton brands, has more than 30 projects either confirmed or in negotiations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America.

The Langham, Bishops Lodge, Santa Fe, formerly known as the Bishops Lodge, will re-open in spring 2018 after a multi-million dollar renovation.

First opened to the public in the 1920s, it covers 317 acres, which include private stables and trails.

The renovation will include an addition that will expand the hotels footprint to 139 rooms and suites.

Warman says the location appealed to the company because there are not many luxury properties there.

We thought we could stand out, he says.

The Langham Place, Wade Park, located in Frisco, Texas, will open in early 2018.

It will have 25 floors of hotel rooms and 10 floors of residences. The sleek, modern property will have 250 guest rooms, including two 2,906 square-foot Presidential Suites.

Other amenities will include a rooftop pool deck, full-service bar, courtyard, and spa.

The Langham Place, San Francisco will be adjacent to the new Transbay Transit Center Project in downtown San Francisco, which developers are calling the Grand Central Station of the West.

The development will be completed later this year, and the hotel has a projected 2019 completion schedule.

Right now, Langham Hotels has four U.S. properties including the Langham, Chicago, which recently earned a spot on the Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star list.

usatoday.com,2012-05-08 00:00:00,Examining the benefits of Greek Life,"['The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Nicole Glass', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Since 1825, all but three U.S. presidents have been members of a fraternity.

85% of Fortune 500 executives were part of Greek life. The first female astronaut was Greek. So was the first female senator. And college graduation rates are 20% higher among Greeks than non-Greeks.

Which begs an obvious question: Does being in a fraternity or sorority increase your chance for success?

Nine million college students are members of a Greek organization and whether they join to make friends, to build their resumes, to go to parties or to learn leadership skills, they each have an incentive to change some aspect of their life.

A common deterrent for joining are the sometimes-negative stereotypes associated with Greek life.

Fraternities and sororities are often associated with hazing, drinking and partying. Since 1975, there has been at least one hazing-induced death per year across college campuses  and 82% of these have come as a result of binge drinking.

But hazing scandals make headlines  and fundraisers and philanthropy events generally do not.

Historically, partying was not the reason to commit to Greek life.

In the 1820s, less than 1% of white males went to liberal arts colleges and universities primarily trained their students to become ministers.

On November 25, 1825, five Union College students came together to form a private group to engage in educational debates and discussions.

Naming their fraternity the Kappa Alpha Society, members got together to prepare themselves for careers that their professors didnt train them for, and to discuss topics that were not covered in class.

Fraternities were often referred to as secret societies. As these societies quickly spread to other campuses and the first sorority emerged in 1831, Greek organizations consisted of a network of supporters, with brothers and sisters vowing each others loyalty to the death.

Although Greek life has changed over time, students who take their membership seriously are still equipped with skills that can be used in their future careers. David Stollman, co-founder of CAMPUSSPEAK, said that Greek organizations can help students improve their leadership and interpersonal skills.

I really see that theres a great correlation between those skills being developed and the ability to be successful in any endeavor, he said. Not necessarily just famous-successful, like a president or CEO, but successful as a community leader or as a small business owner.

What makes Greek life rewarding is that members are given the unique opportunity to interact with and lead their peers.

Sometimes members who dont get along are forced to work together  skills that are vital in the post-college work force. And most importantly, members are given the chance to practice and fail in their endeavors, without losing their network of support.

You get the opportunity to fail miserably and have brothers and sisters that love you and care for you pick you up and dust you off and challenge you to do it again, Stollman said.

Curtis Burrill, American Universitys Greek life coordinator, said sorority and fraternity membership teaches crucial social interaction skills. Making conversation with strangers and running weekly meetings are just two examples.

If you can be the new member educator for 30 women, Im probably going to hire you to run a team, Burrill said.

Gaining from the tradition

But what makes Greek life any different from other on-campus organizations, like the debate team or a sports team?

If youre in the chess club, you dont really have that 200 year history and the ritual and four million alumni, Burrill said.

Although the university Greek advisor finds it unfortunate that particular members sometimes create negative stigmas through their sometimes-irresponsible actions while wearing letters, he still believes the negatives are outweighed by the benefits and that those who join for the right reasons will go far.

And social skills have been proven to take students down a successful path.

During his April 18 visit to American University, New York Times columnist David Brooks emphasized the importance of understanding others to become successful  a skill that former president Bill Clinton mastered and that all politicians have.

What explains success in life, what should you actually be thinking about if youre a college student? said Brooks, Well, you should think about IQ and studying and getting the skills, thats obvious. But you should also think about traits like mindsight  the ability to look into other peoples minds and really tell whats going on there. Thats the skill that politicians have.

Students who join Greek organizations to build a network, make friends and develop leadership and social skills will likely graduate with useful qualities that could take them far. Students who join solely for the partying that Greek organizations are too often criticized for may end up leaving without much benefit.

Unfortunately we all know people that wear letters and arent interested in the right kind of membership, Stollman said.

And at the end of the day, its up to the students to define their reputations.",[]

WASHINGTON  A Senate bill introduced Wednesday to govern the Federal Aviation Administration would force airlines to provide travelers with more information about ever-increasing fees.

The bipartisan bill from Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., ignores contentious subjects such as privatizing air-traffic control or raising the cap on ticket fees for airport construction projects.

This bill benefits Americans who fly and even those who dont,"" Thune said. ""The U.S. Senate has an opportunity to make our skies safer, promote responsible drone usage, make economically significant aerospace manufacturing reforms, and adopt beneficial new protections for the flying public.

If passed, the law would be in effect only until September 2017 as part of an effort to approve some provisions now while postponing the most controversial elements that bogged down a companion measure in the House.

Nelson called the bill a good starting place for lawmakers to negotiate consensus legislation.

Im pleased we were able to include recommendations from a report I unveiled last year that took airlines to task for not adequately disclosing fees charged to passengers,"" Nelson said.

Provisions proposed in the Senate bill include:

 Requiring the Transportation Department to develop a standardized way for airlines to reveal fees for baggage, flight cancellations or changes, ticketing or seat selection, in plain, easy-to-read language, while travelers shop for tickets.

 Automatic refunds of fees for services that arent received, such as for seat assignments, early boarding and carry-on bags.

 Refunds of baggage fees when luggage is lost or delayed.

 Airline notification to families about seats not being adjacent, when tickets are booked.

 Consider requiring refunds to travelers for flight delays, cancellations or itinerary changes as part of a long-awaited consumer regulation.

The department would also review how airlines provide information about delays or cancellations blamed on weather. The provision stems from concerns that airlines and airports cancel flights for reason not tied to weather hazards, such as the size of planes.

For the fast-growing drone industry, the bill would require operators to pass an online test before flying their remote-controlled aircraft. The goal aims to ensure that operators know FAA rules such as keeping the aircraft below 400 feet in the air during daylight hours and within sight of the operator. The test is envisioned as a companion step to registering ownership of drones, which the FAA began requiring in December.

As the FAA completes its initial rules for commercial drones weighing up to 55 pounds this year, the bill would also make changes the drone industry sought, including:

 Allowing FAA to grant special permission for commercial drones to fly at night and farther than where the operator can see the aircraft, moves generally prohibited now.

 Forcing state and local governments to defer to the federal government for laws governing the manufacture, testing, registration and operation of drones. Industry advocates have warned that a patchwork of local laws would make it confusing for operators to follow the rules.

The Senate bill avoided a number of contentious issues approved in February by the House, where opposition has prevented the legislation from moving to the floor. Among the House provisions in the six-year bill that weren't included in the Senate are:

 Shifting air-traffic control from the FAA to a not-for-profit corporation.

 Prohibiting states from developing rest rules for truckers.

The Senate bill also doesn't propose raising the fee attached to each airline, which is currently capped at $4.50 per flight or $18 for each round trip with a connection. Airport groups sought an increase to $8.50 per flight to pay for construction projects, but airlines strongly oppose a fee hike.

Instead of raising ticket fees, the bill would raise the amount distributed in 2017 for airport construction projects to $3.75 billion, from the current $3.35 billion. The money comes from the airport trust fund, which is running a surplus from aviation taxes.

The Senate bill requires FAA to review the minimum distance between seats required for passenger safety. The House panel rejected a department study of seat size and spacing. The Senate's move is a result of travelers and lawmakers complaining about seats growing narrower and closer together.

A Senate committee vote is scheduled March 16, and the bill could be on the Senate floor in April. Current FAA policy legislation expires March 31. A short-term extension is expected while lawmakers negotiate a longer-term bill.

Johnson, a two-term governor and former construction company owner, hopes to grow Cannabis Sativa into a major marijuana company as more states consider legalizing the drug.

I think in 10 years, for the most part, the U.S. will legalize marijuana, Johnson said. And what the U.S. does, so does the world. With the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington, we are already seeing that the demand is significant. We believe the opportunity is here to deliver products that could change the world for the better, he said.

Cannabis Sativa will make marijuana-based oils aimed at helping children with epilepsy, as well as cough drop-like edibles for recreational use.

Couple of things hit you when you try the product. One is, wow, why would anybody smoke marijuana given this is an alternative? Johnson said. And then secondly, its just very, very pleasant. I mean, very pleasant.

Cannabis Sativa also announced that it had acquired Kush, a pot research business, and named Kush founder Steve Kubby as chairman. Johnson will receive $1 a year in salary and equity in the company. Kubby will get $60,000 a year.

Like other thinly traded marijuana stocks, Cannabis Sativa has had its share of volatility. The stock has traded as low as 51 cents a share, rising to $18 before shedding more than half its value.

Cannabis Sativa was initially incorporated in 2005 as a tanning salon business. It sold Saraha Sun Tanning in September. Before the acquisition of Kush, the companys prime focus had been distributing herbal-based skin products.",[]
usatoday.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Not welcome: Anti-immigration posters in Europe attack Muslims,"['Est March', 'Helena Bachmann', 'Special For Usa Today', 'Durchsetzungsinitiative Zur Ausschaffung Krimineller Ausl Nder', 'P M']","Swiss People's Party poster (Photo: Facebook screenshot)

GENEVA  Political parties campaigning to stem the rising tide of immigrants pouring into Europe are resorting to posters that have racial undertones and denigrate Muslims.

The latest example: a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag promoted by Switzerlands largest party in a failed bid to win last month's referendum that would have expelled immigrants convicted of crimes.

The Swiss People's Party's anti-immigration message  ""Make the country safe, say yes to deportation of foreign criminals  did not persuade a majority of Swiss to support its view. The Feb. 28 referendum was defeated by 59% of voters.

Facebook | @Durchsetzungsinitiative zur Ausschaffung krimineller Auslander Durchsetzungsinitiative zur Ausschaffung... - Durchsetzungsinitiative zur Ausschaffung krimineller Auslander | Facebook

While the black sheep may appear to be a racial metaphor, its not about race, said Georg Lutz, director of the Swiss Electoral Studies at the University of Lausanne. It symbolizes a foreigner, an outsider.

Portraying foreigners as black sheep is not a new tactic for the party. It used a similar image for its successful 2007 parliamentary elections. That poster showed three white sheep booting a lone black one out of its flock.

In a 2011 campaign, the Swiss People's Party was found guilty of racial profiling after an immigrant from Kosovo slashed the throat of a party member after a quarrel. The party promoted a poster showing black shadows marching across a Swiss flag with the caption, Kosovars slash Swiss. Stop mass immigration.

Two Kosovo nationals filed a complaint and the court ruled that the poster incited hostility against an ethnic group. Party members responsible for the advertisement received a fine and a suspended sentence.

Other anti-immigration campaigns in Europe have used similar negative images of foreigners.

In 2014, Germanys far-right National Democratic Party re-launched a controversial poster that showed three Middle Eastern people sitting on a flying carpet with a caption: ""Have a safe flight home.""

That same year in Austria, the countrys Freedom Party circulated a poster showing a blond woman with the phrase: ""Too beautiful for a veil.""

Die Lizenzbestimmungen von Fotolia gelten anscheinend fur die #FPO und #Strache nicht pic.twitter.com/Vzqu8uhSNI  FPO Watch (@fpoeticker) July 3, 2014

And back in 2008, Italys Northern League distributed an election poster showing an American Indian with the slogan: ""They suffered immigration; now they live on a reserve.

The anti-immigration campaigns come as Europe copes with a huge influx of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

In Switzerland, foreign-born residents make up nearly a quarter of the population, compared with 13% in the United States.

But Switzerland has a long tradition of opening its borders to immigrants and refugees, and the posters have sparked criticism at home and abroad. The Geneva-based Human Rights Council said the images incite hatred and called for the removal of offensive posters from public spaces. The Swiss People's Party refused, citing free speech.

That right has kept the party out of legal trouble. In the past several years, private citizens filed two lawsuits against the party. One was over the sheep poster and the other over the image showing a veiled woman and warning that, with the influx of Muslims into the country, Switzerland could become like Iraq. In both cases, judges ruled that the posters could not be banned.

""In a democracy, it is important that opinions can be presented even if they offend a lot of people,"" the court added.

The Swiss People's Party argues that a disproportionate number of foreigners are lawbreakers. Government statistics indicate they make up over 70% of the prison population. In all of the party's campaigns, migrants are portrayed as dishonest and dangerous individuals who abuse the countrys welfare system and perpetrate crime.

The party regularly uses Switzerlands referendum-based direct democracy  in which any individual or group can get an initiative on a ballot by collecting 100,000 signatures on a petition  to launch controversial measures and equally contentious campaign materials. If passed, the proposals become law.

In 2008, the party launched a proposal to make the process of naturalization more difficult with a poster depicting dark hands grabbing Swiss passports. However, over 63% of voters rejected the measure.

The next year, the party pushed through a referendum, approved by 57% of voters, to ban the construction of minarets on the countrys mosques. The campaign sign showed a woman dressed in a burqa, standing on a Swiss flag in front of minarets shaped like missiles.

Some of Europes other populist groups have copied the Swiss posters. The minaret artwork found its way to Frances National Front Party for the 2010 regional elections. Germanys National Democrats and the Czech Republics National Coalition recycled the sheep image.

The goal of these posters is to create controversy, provoke and grab attention. In that sense, theyve been very successful, Lutz said.

Etta Myers at a February 2016 rally in Annapolis, to override the governors veto of a bill restoring voting rights for ex-offenders. (Photo: Courtesy of Etta Myers)

Prison was where I spent most of my life, and it was where I became an adult. I am 62 years old and I was sentenced to life plus five years in 1977, when I was 21. I always thought that once I was released, I'd start working to make life better for the people inside  the incarcerated women and men with whom I spent practically a lifetime.

The first step I took after my release was to fight for legislation that would restore the right to vote for 40,000 men and women on probation and parole in Maryland. Weve already waited long enough to be a part of the American democracy, weve paid our dues, and we need our citizenship rights restored upon leaving prison.

That is how a fair and democratic American society ought to work.

On Thursday, a few weeks before next month's Maryland primary, our right to vote will be restored.

The Maryland House and Senate restored the right to vote for residents on probation and parole in a bill passed last year. Gov. Larry Hogan vetoed it last spring, but we didnt give in. I didnt wait all these years to come this close to voting, only to let a governor overrule the majority of the Maryland House and Senate. So we organized  fellow ex-offenders, community groups, grassroots organizers and champions in the legislature  and state lawmakers overrode that veto last month.

Because of our success, at age 62 Ill soon be voting for the first time ever, and so will many of the women I shared my life with behind bars.

This day is especially meaningful to me because I spent 36 years in prison on a wrongful conviction. A Baltimore jury convicted me of first-degree murder based on testimony from three witnesses who, according to records, had been drinking and smoking marijuana. I was one of several dozen inmates released in 2013, when the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that in many cases from decades ago, jurors were given incorrect instructions leading to wrongful convictions.

After so long in prison, I want to start living like the rest of society. I long to take part in our democracy and make my voice heard. Voting is a right that gives me the ear of people in power and through that, I have the power to change what I know to be wrong: our countrys enormous problem with mass incarceration, which disproportionately impacts black and brown people.

It was in prison that my fight to help incarcerated people started. As a lifer, I realized that I was stripped of rights, and it awoke in me a need to fight for justice. I became the liaison between the prison population and the administration. For decades, I raised our concerns with the people in power, telling them how we desperately needed decent education and tolerable living conditions. I started a group for gang members ages 16 to 25, helping them out of criminal activity and back on the right path. All the while, I worked as a seamstress and studied upholstery.

With the help of God and inspiration from the Bible, I had a chance to educate myself and others while I was in prison. But this is not the case for everyone. Thats why restoring the rights for ex-offenders is crucial.

It allows us to vote for politicians who will help prisoners and returning citizens get educated, teach them skills and empower them, instead of excluding them from democracy. Prison in itself is punishment enough, and society should trust that those of us incarcerated are already paying for all of our sins.

Today, my arthritis unfortunately prevents me from using my skills as an upholsterer, so I spend my days volunteering at church and grassroots organizations, doing what I can to make my community better.

Im proud to say that I helped bring change for incarcerated people and ex-offenders, who can now vote immediately after theyre released. I cant wait to cast my own vote.

Presidential candidates are running on the dark theme that things simply arent as good as they used to be. Our problems are unprecedented and seemingly intractable: Economic uncertainty. Unrest on college campuses. Racial tension. Rioting in black communities amid allegations that police are heavy-handed.

Theres growing concern about the environment. The president, sick of gun violence, chides the gun lobby for its intransigence. Theres an unpopular war in Asia. In the Middle East, Israel is on edge, and critics slam the president for not doing enough to help. Then there are the Russians. Determined to maintain control over its periphery, Moscow invades a neighbor, and the U.S. president is criticized for weakness in the face of Kremlin aggression.

The presidents approval rating, meanwhile, languishes below 50%, and the race to succeed him is a chaotic free-for-all. One bombastic candidate is threatening to run as an independent. In the midst of all this, theres a sudden vacancy on the Supreme Court. The lame-duck president knows its his constitutional duty to nominate a replacementbut its also an election year and powerful Senate Republicans vow to block him. Never before has there been such obvious political maneuvering to create a vacancy so that an outgoing president can fill it and thereby deny the opportunity to a new president about to be elected by the people, says one.

Has there ever been an election year like 2016?

Indeed there has, for everything I just described happened half-a-century ago, in 1968, arguably still the granddaddy of election-year crazy. The fear we have today that things are headed off the rails is nothing new. The 1968 campaign unfolded during a year of deep anxiety. It was also a year of tragedy and stunning political developments.

As 1968 began, Lyndon Johnson intended to seek re-election. Domestically, he was a towering figure -- the president who got the Civil Rights bill passed, ushered in Medicare and launched the War on Poverty. But there were also 536,000 American troops in Vietnam, dying at the rate of 46 a day. In January, a communist offensive  Tet  shocked Americans, shattering Johnsons argument that the war was winnable.

LBJ paid the price. In the New Hampshire primary on March 12, while he beat anti-war senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, he failed to reach 50%  a huge embarrassment for an incumbent president. Four days later, Johnsons arch enemy Robert F. Kennedy jumped in the race, sealing the presidents fate. On March 31, wrapping up a speech on Vietnam, Johnson shocked a nationwide TV audience by announcing that he would not seek re-election.

Just a few days later came tragedy -- the April 4 murder of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Riots began within hours and quickly spread to at least 110 cities nationwide, in what was said to be the greatest social unrest in the United States since the Civil War.

One reporter, Edward Kosner summed it up well: ""it was Pandora's box flung open -- an apocalyptic act that loosed the furies brooding in the shadows of America's sullen ghettos.

In Washington, machine guns sprouted on the White House and Capitol grounds, as rioters came perilously close. One city that remained peaceful was Indianapolis, where Kennedythe brother of an assassinated presidentmade a powerful and poignant appeal for calm. It was, he said, a good time to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in. Two months later, he too was dead from an assassins bullet.

The Democratic convention, held that tense summer in Chicago, turned violent. Anti-war protestors and others took to the streets, to be met by 23,000 police and National Guardsmen. Blood flowed as protesters shouted, The whole world is watching. Inside the mood was ugly as well. I think we've got a bunch of thugs here, CBSs Walter Cronkite said, as reporter Dan Rather was accosted and hauled off the convention floor. The nomination went to Vice President Hubert Humphreywho had never entered one primary.

The political story for Republicans was equally extraordinary. In 1962, six years before he won the presidency, Richard Nixon told Americans that you wont have Nixon to kick around anymore. His cliffhanger victory over Humphrey remains one of the most amazing comebacks in American history.

The twist to the race was a surprisingly strong challenge from former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who, running as independent, won five states and 46 electoral votes. A boorish, bigoted populist, Wallace knew he couldnt win. His apparent goal was to deny both Nixon and Humphrey an Electoral College majority, but he failed.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

How does 2016 compare? The current frontrunner, Donald Trump, who more than qualifies as a boorish, bigoted populist himself, had a spat with the pope and even as he advances closer to the Republican nomination, is still squawking occasionally about running as an independent if he doesnt get his way.

On the Democratic side, who could have predicted a 74-year old Jewish socialist from Vermont by way of Brooklyn would pose a real challenge to a 68-year old former first lady and secretary of State? The rise of the Islamic State terror group, the unexpected death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the Black Lives Matter movement are also contributing to this years campaign drama.

But beyond the parallels, there are differences and they are profound: Dozens of American soldiers are not being killed every day in a foreign war, and American leaders are not being assassinated. We should be grateful that 2016 is no 1968.

We come into the world nude. Then things get complicated.

On Monday, Kim Kardashian, cloaked in nothing but her absurd fame, posted another naked selfie (black bars strategically placed to protect a fickle modesty). The slut-shaming ensued. Singer Bette Midler said weve seen it all before. Actress Chloe Moretz told her to be a better role model. Journalist Piers Morgan offered to buy her some clothes. But many also came to her defense, lamenting the shaming and wondering why anyone felt they could tell her what she should and should not do with her own body.

Do you know what I love about feminism? That I can see both Kim Kardashian AND Chloe Moretz's point of view.



Nuance, people. Let's use it.  Louise O' Neill (@oneilllo) March 8, 2016

A generation ago, access to nudity was limited. Today, its omnipresent. Our culture simultaneously permits more nude imagery now than at any other time in history, and yet has a somewhat paradoxical tendency to be shocked and disturbed by it. Its also a culture that, unsurprisingly, consents to one set of rules for mens bodies and another for womens.

When you're like I have nothing to wear LOL pic.twitter.com/UlSLZb1fp1  Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 7, 2016

Take Donald Trumps penis.

Kardashians tweet was a punctuation mark on a weekspent musing over the fact that the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination felt the need to assure the American electorate there was absolutely nothing wrong with the size of his hands. For anyone having trouble with euphemisms, thats code for his penis.

The conversation after Trump evokes his member during a debate is, ""What is wrong with us as a society?"" The conversation after Kardashian posts an unexceptional semi-nude photo is, ""What is wrong with her?""

When Trump brings his penis to the limelight, while obviously this rankles the Republican establishment, nonetheless, there is a certain kind of respect he's afforded for going there, said Juliet Williams, a professor of gender studies at UCLA. He gets credit for that swagger. But when a woman does it, the thinly veiled slut-shaming is immediate.

So how did we get here?

Kim Kardashian's latest nude selfies have gotten a lot of flak. So why was Donald Trump cheered on when he defended his 'manhood' on live TV? VPC

Throughout history, nervousness and embarrassment about the human body has changed at various times, said Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture.

In the 1960s, I Dream of Jeannie viewers werent permitted to see even Barbara Edens belly button. Accessing nudity was a clandestine exercise, an illicit adventure marked by scouting newsstands and shuffling down the darkened row of a pornographic theater.

""You might be able to find Playboys under your dad's mattress, Thompson said. Or you'd have to settle for the lingerie section of the Sears catalog.""

In October, Playboy announced it would stop publishing nude photos. But not because execs felt there was anything fundamentally exploitative about them. It couldnt make a profit anymore.

""That battle has been fought and won,"" CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times. ""You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free.""

According to the Pew Research Center, 84% of American adults use the Internet, and 74% of online adults use social networking sites. For obvious reasons, the prevalence of Internet pornography is difficult to measure, but according to one assessment in 2008 approximately 100 million men in North America logged on to porn.

Yet we keep telling women to cover up.

In 2002, the Department of Justice spent thousands of dollars on drapes to cover two partially nude statues in the Great Hall. It was reported that Attorney General John Ashcroft ordered the statues covered because he didn't like being photographed in front of them.

In 2013, The New York Times ran a cover story on breast cancer that showed part of a woman's nipple. Some readers were shocked, outraged even, that the newspaper of record would, as they argued, try to sexualize the disease to sell papers. Others weren't sure what was so provocative about a partial areola.

New York Times Publishes Nipple Slip on Front Cover http://t.co/GcLFCICdZ1pic.twitter.com/6GCJfHygGK  Parent Herald (@ParentHerald) November 30, 2013

We cant seem to make up our minds about womens bodies. Well cover up an offending nude statue, but well comb the Internet for leaked photos of Jennifer Lawrence. How many searched for footage from Erin Andrews' peeping tom?

Kardashians post Monday wasnt anything we hadnt seen before. Her public life began with a sex tape (likely not on her terms). She posed nude in Paper magazine and broke the Internet (more on her terms). She made a book of selfies that show her bare body (completely on her terms).

In the case of Kardashians recent photo, which was actually a throwback, what got attention wasnt her flash of flesh  weve seen it before  it was all the chatter about it. And that becomes a conversation about her character.

""The pretense is that the scandal is the exposure of her body,"" Williams said. ""When really it's about a woman who is unabashed about profiting from our society's consumption of those bodies.""

In response to the controversy, Kardashian posted an essay on her website called #StraightUp: Happy International Women's Day. She wrote: ""I don't do drugs, I hardly drink, I've never committed a crime  and yet I'm a bad role model for being proud of my body?"" She signed off with, ""I am a mother. I am a wife, a sister, a daughter, an entrepreneur and I am allowed to be sexy. #internationalwomensday""

Rachel Kitson, a psychologist who has written about the Kardashian phenomenon, said in an email that while Kardashian is a feminist paradox, one area that troubles her is the effect her images can have on young girls.

""What concerns me are the expectations for teenagers, especially girls, to expose themselves,"" she said. ""I think it can set unrealistic and unhealthy standards for both genders in certain contexts.""

Kardashian, who's become the paragon of modern narcissism, will likely post more nude photos. And you'll likely look at them. And then we'll all talk about it.

You can have a great poet, but they're only wonderful if someone reads them, Thompson said. You have the artist, and you have the consumer.

Would Thompson call the selfie virtuoso an artist?

""I would, he said. She's certainly not a physicist.

SAN FRANCISCO  Cloud storage company Box, which announced its fourth quarter results Wednesday, continues to battle its way to profitability in what promises to be a challenging year for many Silicon Valley startups and unicorns.

The company said it narrowed its per share loss to 26 cents per share on $85 million in revenue for the quarter, beating expectations of a 29 cent EPS loss on $82 million in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst estimates.

The year-on-year improvement from a loss of $1.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 was enough to lift the stock. Box (BOX) shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading after gaining 4% at $12.55 during the regular session.

Under founder and CEO Aaron Levie, Box has been investing in security, compliance and administrative technology with a vision to further streamline its services in order to allow customers to share and collaborate on cloud-based projects. Partnerships with former rivals such as Microsoft and Salesforce are helping Levie secure his position in the space.

Among the other highlights: Box revenue for full year 2016 was $303 million, up 40% year-over-year, while the $85 million in revenue for the quarter represents a 36% year-over-year gain. The company also touted that it had ""achieved (its) first positive cash flow from operations as a public company in the fourth quarter of FY 2016 of $5 million."" The progress puts it on track to achieve positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017, it said.

Even with Wednesday's gain, Box shares still have a long way to go to recoup their initial surge in the public market.

That event initially boded well for Levie, who started the company while still in college. Anticipating demand, the stock was priced at $14 and soared 66% immediately to $20 in January 2015. The company was briefly valued at $1.7 billion, before the stock started heading south for the better part of the year. Its current market cap is $1.4 billion.

COLUMBUS, Ohio  GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz aren't the only Republicans railing against the establishment.

In Ohio, Tea Party leaders and social conservatives recruited dozens of like-minded Republicans to run against current members of the state party's 66-member governing body.

Their frustration mirrors the nationwide angst, but their complaints are Ohio-, and often Gov. John Kasich-, specific: They won't forgive Kasich for expanding Medicaid to lower-income Ohioans over the objections of some GOP state lawmakers. They loathe the governor's support of nationwide Common Core education standards and say the state party does little to check the governor's power.

""Challengers are doing phenomenally well, because a lot of the Republican base is kind of fed up,"" said John McAvoy of the Northwest Ohio Conservative Coalition. He and Portage County Tea Party executive director Tom Zawistowski recruited challengers for nearly all of the 54 contested races for state central committee. ""I believe the exact same reason that the Cruzes and the Trumps are doing well, thats whats also going on at the bottom of the ticket.""

These bottom-of-the-ticket races don't get much attention, especially in the presidential election year, but the 66 unpaid members  33 men and 33 women, one of each for every Senate district  make important decisions about the direction of the Republican Party in Ohio, including whether to endorse incumbent lawmakers and who will serve as party chair.

In 2008, just 18 of these races were contested, but that number has risen in recent years. The bar for making the ballot is low: just five signatures and no fee. The anti-establishment effort collected nearly $5,000 through Ohio Citizens PAC  a small amount for a statewide push  and created groups like the Hamilton County Republican PAC and Ohio Republican PAC to endorse candidates.

Still, established incumbents will win the vast majority of these races; about 20 could be real contests, said Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges, adding that he has ""zero hard feelings"" against those organizing the effort to unseat incumbents. But challengers shouldn't count on Trump supporters voting for them on the down-ticket races either, Borges said.

""They supposedly hate the establishment,"" Borges said. ""They dont hate the establishment. They hate the fact that they arent the establishment.""

Among challengers' complaints: The state central committee recently endorsed Kasich for president, a show of support that committee members said was logical given the historic nature of a sitting Republican governor running for the White House. But opponents call the endorsement a clear conflict of interest because several members of the state central committee are also Kasich delegates.

""I thought it was a poor decision for the Ohio Republican Party to make for every Republican in Ohio,"" said Cincinnati Tea Party President Ann Becker, who is running for state central committee in Butler County. ""They should have stayed out of the endorsement process.""

For challengers, the endorsement is just one more example of the tight hold Kasich has on the state party. Team Kasich helped arrange the 2012 ouster of then-Ohio Republican Party chairman Kevin DeWine, and later supported Borges' bid to lead the party in 2013. The state central committee has avoided voting on the Republican National Committee platform, which opposes Common Core standards that Kasich supports in Ohio.

They supposedly hate the establishment. They dont hate the establishment. They hate the fact that they arent the establishment. Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges

Borges said the platform is a four-year-old document that led to Republican losses nationwide, and Kasich doesn't wield any undue influence over the party.

""All (Kasich) has ever asked me to do is run the party the right way,"" Borges said. ""He does not get involved in the day-to-day operations of the party at all.""

And just take a look at the results, said Alex Triantafilou, chairman of the Hamilton County Republican Party. Republicans hold every statewide office and a super-majority in both the House and Senate. Kasich decimated weak Democratic governor candidate Ed FitzGerald in 2014, and is running for president.

Yet Triantafilou, a state central committee member, is facing a challenger, Roman Jerger, for the first time.

""For whatever reason, they dont like success,"" Triantafilou said of the challengers. ""The Republican Party has dominated statewide elections. Theyve had an extraordinary run.""

But that doesn't mean much if GOP lawmakers and elected officials don't stand up for conservative ideas, challengers say. ""They are the definition of RINO, Republican in Name Only, starting with John Kasich who is running in the wrong primary. John Kasich is a Democrat, not a Republican,"" Zawistowski said.

In a Quinnipiac University Poll released Wednesday, Kasich trailed Trump by 6 percentage points among Ohio voters. But with Tea Party voters, Kasich was 24 percentage points behind Cruz, and 19 percentage points behind Trump.

Still, challengers underestimate how easy it would be to change the course of the Ohio Republican Party, said former Madeira Mayor Mary Anne Christie, who serves on the state central committee. She knows that firsthand from when she tried to become vice chair of the party in 2013 but didn't have enough votes.

""Its great to talk about what you are going to do, but you cant get it just because you stand up there and preach,"" Christie said.

And committee member Stanley Aronoff, a former Ohio Senate president, said the governing body is more diverse than challengers might think. ""You are sort of elected because of your own positions and execute what group feels is good for the Republican Party,"" he said.

But McAvoy, and others mounting this challenge, say what's good for the Republican Party is change.

""Were latching onto the wave that youre seeing. The Trump wave. The Cruz wave,"" McAvoy said. ""We have to capitalize on the fury of the people. They are pissed.""

usatoday.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,How to eat like Beyonce for a week,"['Spoon University', 'The University Of Texas At Austin', 'Morgan Baskin', 'Usa Today Network', 'Carol Alderman', 'Usa Today Network Josh Hafner Usa Today', 'Sam Lisker', 'Alexandra Samuels']","Remember when Beyonce went vegan back in 2013? Well her trainer and diet planner, Marco Borges, released a complete list of everything she ate  breakfast, lunch and dinner  for those 22 days.

Ive condensed her 22-day plan to a more manageable seven-day plan so you can try it. See if you feel as flawless as Beyonce did.

Day 1

Breakfast

Beyonce loves her green smoothies. Hers normally include banana, almond butter, protein powder and a heap of greens. This ones pretty similar, as long as you omit the Greek yogurt.

Lunch

One of Beyonce s go-to lunches is a salad. But dont be disappointed; these salads arent the wilted iceberg lettuce topped with ranch that youre used to. Get ready for some mango, kale and avocado goodness.

Dinner

Did you know you can make noodles out of zucchini? Well you can, and Beyonce did. Check out how to make them here.

Day 2

Breakfast

Another vegan staple is chia pudding. Chia seeds are packed full of fiber, B vitamins and Omega-3s. They also make a pretty good pudding replacement. Beyonce s go to flavor is vanilla, but theres tons of room for experimentation with this easy breakfast.

Lunch

Lunch today is another avocado salad. Add some jicama, a Mexican yam, for some more flavor.

Dinner

Quinoa is practically a staple in a vegan diet. This quinoa and black bean salad will pack in tons of protein, which of course is important for vegans.

Day 3

Breakfast

Oatmeal is a filling and delicious way to wake up, and is pretty easily made vegan with a simple switch of milk with almond milk. Beyonce likes hers with some banana and a scoop of almond butter.

Lunch

Curried rice and lentils. Lentils are very important. They gave Beyonce the protein needed to rehearse, record, and do all the things she does in a day.

Dinner

You wont even miss the meat with this black bean burger.

Day 4

Breakfast

Cereal is very simply made vegan. All you have to do is switch the milk. Beyonces version of vegan cereal, however, is a bit healthier than just Cinnamon Toast Crunch and soy milk. She prefers puffed rice cereal (more specifically, she ate this one) and half a banana with a cup of almond milk.

Lunch

Beyonce loves kale, if you didnt already notice from her iconic kale sweatshirt. So lunch today is a kale, apple and raisin salad with a dijon vinaigrette.

Dinner

Pesto pasta is easy and delicious. Throw in some extra veggies to follow Beyonces recipe.

Day 5

Breakfast

Oatmeal is a versatile breakfast, so change up Day 3s recipe by adding some cinnamon and apples.

Lunch

Lunch today is simple. Just remake that Day 3 lentil curry recipe and youre good to go.

Dinner

Have a hearty meal of sweet potato and black bean chili.

Day 6

Breakfast

Switch up the smoothie recipe by blending up mixed berries, coconut water, half an avocado and some chocolate protein powder.

Lunch

Skip the cheese with this hummus and veggie quesadilla.

Dinner

Got any leftovers from Day 2s quinoa and black bean salad? Good, have them tonight.

Day 7

Breakfast

Stick to an easy breakfast for your last day. Have some cereal and half a banana topped with almond milk.

Lunch

I know youll be missing kale once this week is over, so treat yourself to a nice kale chickpea salad.

Dinner

Remember those zucchini noodles from Day 1? Make them again and top them with some ginger, sesame oil, maple syrup and soy sauce for an Asian noodle salad.

Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said he made a ""series of reforms"" to how county prosecutors handle wiretaps after he took office in January. (Photo: Jay Calderon, The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun)

PALM SPRINGS, Calif.  Prosecutors in a Los Angeles suburb say they have dramatically scaled back a vast and legally questionable eavesdropping operation, built by federal drug agents, that once accounted for nearly a fifth of all U.S. wiretaps.

The wiretapping, authorized by prosecutors and a single state-court judge in Riverside County, alarmed privacy advocates and even some U.S. Justice Department lawyers, who warned that it was likely illegal. An investigation last year by The Desert Sun and USA TODAY found that the operation almost certainly violated federal wiretapping laws while using millions of secretly intercepted calls and texts to make hundreds of arrests nationwide.

Riversides district attorney, Mike Hestrin, acknowledged being concerned by the scope of that surveillance, and said he enacted significant reforms last summer to rein it in. Wiretap figures his office released this week offer the first evidence that the enormous eavesdropping program has wound down to more routine levels.

I definitely dont apologize for using this tool to hit the cartels in Riverside County, said Hestrin, who took office last year. I think the reforms I put in place were necessary, but this is still a tool that I believe in. It needs to be used cautiously, but it should be available when necessary.

The number of wiretaps authorized in Riverside County started to climb in 2010; it quadrupled by 2014, when the county court approved 624 wiretaps  three times as many as any other state or federal court. Most of the surveillance was conducted at the behest of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, who used the eavesdropping to make arrests and seize drugs and cash as far away as New York and Virginia.

Officials approved another 607 wiretaps in 2015, according to the figures released by the district attorneys office. Most were approved in the first half of the year, before Hestrin said he installed a stricter standard that required every new wiretap application to have a strong investigatory nexus to Riverside County.

Taps have dwindled since then. So far this year, Hestrin has approved only 14. In the first two months of last year, his office approved 126.

If the current rate continues, Riverside County will end 2016 with about between 85 and 120 wiretaps  still enough to rank it among the nations busiest wiretapping jurisdictions, based on 2014 records. But the county will no longer be in a stratosphere all its own.

Im pleased to hear this, but it never should have gotten out of hand in the first place, said Steve Harmon, the Riverside County Public Defender. If there is no strong investigative connection to Riverside County, then Riverside County has no interest being in this business.

Privacy advocates, who had expressed alarm in the past, were more cautious.

Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said it was reassuring the Riverside wiretap numbers had normalized, but worried there is no oversight even for new eavesdropping orders. Almost all wiretaps are sealed, and are sometimes kept secret even from the suspects who are arrested as a result of the eavesdropping, Lynch said.

We are reliant on the prosecutors and the law enforcement officers to do their jobs and the judges not to just stamp a signature on them, but without releasing these on a regular basis its hard to be satisfied that the system is operating the way it should be, Lynch said.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the abrupt drop in eavesdropping. In the past, DEA officials had said the surveillance was an important tool for targeting cartels that had turned the suburbs around Riverside into one of the nation's busiest drug trafficking corridors.

The majority of Riversides wiretap surge occurred under the watch of former District Attorney Paul Zellerbach, a one-term top prosecutor who was ousted by Hestrin at the end of 2014.

In interviews last fall, Zellerbach said his staff was efficient and effective at processing wiretaps. As word spread through law enforcement circles, the office received more and more requests to eavesdrop. Zellerbach had no qualms about leading the nation in taps. I thought we were doing a hell of a job,"" Zellerbach said in November.

Others did not share that opinion. Justice Department lawyers warned the DEA in private that the wiretaps were unlikely to withstand a legal challenge, and they generally refused to use them as evidence in federal court.

The surveillance also suffered a more systematic flaw. The Desert Sun and USA TODAY found last year that Zellerbach had been allowing lower-level lawyers in his office to approve wiretap applications, despite a federal law that required him to do it himself. That flaw has the potential to invalidate as many as 738 wiretaps since 2013.

As a result, Riversides wiretap operation is now facing its first significant legal challenge. Lawyers for a marijuana trafficking suspect last week asked a federal judge in Kentucky to declare that five wiretaps used in that case were illegal. But their attack on the surveillance spoke far more broadly.

In sum, Riverside County made a mockery of individual privacy rights, ignored federal requirements limiting the use of wiretaps and permitted law enforcement to intercept telephone calls at their whim and caprice, argued attorney Brian Butler, a former federal prosecutor.

Although Zellerbach left the district attorneys office at the end of 2014, the surge of eavesdropping continued well into 2015, with prosecutors approving hundreds in just the first few months of the year. Hestrin, the new district attorney, said most of those he approved were spinoffs of previous wiretaps, needed for investigations that he inherited from the Zellerbach administration. The volume was staggering, he said.

A spinoff is technically a new wire but its from an existing investigation, Hestrin said. Maybe a bad guy is dropping one phone and getting a new one. And I wasnt going to come in and shut down massive investigations into the cartel.

Eventually, by the summer, the inherited investigations had run their course and Hestrin introduced his new standard for wiretap applications, limiting their use to cases in which the crime was closely tied to the county. In the past, court records show prosecutors had approved surveillance based on tenuous links to Riverside, including one case in which the DEA sought to use a Riverside wiretap to gather evidence on a money laundering suspect in Los Angeles on the basis that the phone belonging to a suspected courier had been in contact with a phone that had, in turn, been in touch with another phone belonging to a Riverside County nightclub owner.

After that change, Hestrin said law enforcement kept asking for wiretaps, but prosecutors said no frequently. Eventually, the requests stopped coming.

Riversides increased scrutiny of wiretaps applications is a step in the right direction, but it doesnt erase years of taps that were awarded under questionable policies, said Adrienna Wong, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.

Wong said Wednesday that the ACLU submitted a public records request asking the DAs office for wiretap polices  both old and new  after The Desert Sun/USA TODAY investigation was published.

The DAs office refused.

Given the lack of transparency, we remain concerned about the issue, Wong said. And the fact that the problem may be solved, at least for the time being ... doesnt address what may have happened in the past.

TEMPE, Ariz. (AP)  Albert Pujols collected his first two hits since offseason foot surgery, Mike Trout tripled and doubled, and the Los Angeles Angels roughed up Scott Kazmir in a 13-13, nine-inning tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday.

Pujols, who had been 0 for 5 in two games, followed his RBI single up the middle in the first with a run-scoring bloop single to right an inning later on Kazmir's final pitch.

""He's starting to get there,"" Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ""He swung the bat well. I think our 'A' lineup out there looked really, really good.""

Trout's slicing triple to right also came off Kazmir, who allowed five runs and six hits with two walks while getting four outs.

Angels starter Jered Weaver wasn't any better. Joc Pederson, Austin Barnes and Scott Van Slyke all homered off Weaver, who was charged with five runs and six hits in 2 2-3 innings.

Weaver, who had a career-worst 4.64 ERA last year amid hip pain, topped out at 81 mph with his fastball in his second start.

""I wake up every day hoping this is the day it's going to click,"" Weaver said. ""It just hasn't happened yet.""

Trout went the other way again for a double in the fourth off Chris Hatcher and scored three runs. He's 6 for 10 in five games.

STARTING TIME

Dodgers: Kazmir spent parts of three seasons with the Angels before being released in 2011. He left Houston to sign a three-year, $48 million deal in the offseason.

""I ended up throwing fastballs right there with two strikes and got hurt,"" Kazmir said. ""As far as health, I feel great. It's really frustrating to have the outing that I did.""

Angels: Adrian Gonzalez added an RBI single in the third off Weaver. A drop in velocity has coincided with his recent struggles.

""I think if I can locate I can get guys out at 60 mph,"" Weaver said. ""It's where you put the ball and I wasn't able to put the ball where I wanted to today and it showed.""

TRAINER'S ROOM

Dodgers: OF Howie Kendrick (groin) sat out for a third straight day, but participated in morning drills. . OF Alex Guerrero (knee) remain sidelined . LHP Julio Arias (groin), the club's top pitching prospect, is scheduled to make his debut Friday against the Angels.

Angels: Closer Huston Street (calf) could pitch Thursday. . Tyler Skaggs (Tommy John surgery) threw his third bullpen session.

CRON AT FIRST

While Pujols returned sooner than expected from November surgery, he's only been the DH.

C.J. Cron, who backed up Pujols last season at first base, started there and had no issues while going 1 for 3. Scioscia said he's ""definitely"" comfortable with Cron at first.

""He's moving better,"" Scioscia said. ""His hands were always OK and he's got a strong arm. And he's throwing the ball accurately. . He has the game to play at a higher level at first base for sure.""

PEDERSON SPARK

Pederson was a rookie All-Star before hitting .170 over the final three months last season. He was 1 for 7 before his towering homer to right. He finished 2 for 4 in a game that had 36 hits.

UP NEXT

Dodgers: RHP Kenta Maeda starts Thursday against Oakland.

Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney, scratched from his first start due to illness, debuts Thursday against Arizona.
