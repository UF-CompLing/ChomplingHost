NPR News

In a time of media fragmentation and sound-bites, NPR has succeeded by focusing on its core: in-depth, quality news. We've evolved from a secondary to an essential news source, with dozens of bureaus around the world and the nation. Drawing on more than 340 news staff (reporters, correspondents, newscasters, editors, producers hosts and bloggers) in the United States and abroad-from Washington D.C. and New York to Shanghai and Kabul, we have the capacity to stay on top of breaking news, follow the most critical stories of the day and track complex issues over the long-term.

On-air and online, NPR presents fact-based, independent journalism that examines and airs diverse perspectives. Our journalists strive for mastery of the narrative form, telling stories in ways that transport the audience to the places where news is happening and introducing the people affected.

Digital Services

In addition to a significant and growing radio service, NPR is widely recognized as a leader among media organizations in the digital arena. We are enthusiastically embracing digital media platforms and culture. Over the last two years our entire newsroom participated in extensive training to support a successful transition to the multimedia environment.

NPR.org presents constantly updated news and alerts, timely news blogs, streaming audio, downloadable multimedia content, exclusive multimedia features (video and photojournalism), and free access to more than 10 years of archived coverage and transcripts to web users through NPR.org. NPR Podcasts are among the most-downloaded sources of podcasts in the world, delivering approximately 32 million podcast downloads every month.

NPR realized the power of mobile early, launching a NPR News iPhone App in August 2009, which quickly joined the ranks of the top free News apps in the iPhones App store, and then a NPR Music App in June 2010; an Android NPR News App in December, 2009; and an app and optimized site for the iPad when the product was first introduced. NPR.org was revamped in the summer of 2009 to more seamlessly bridge the NPR on-air and online experience. Digital metrics suggest that our audience is engaged with us; we have approximately 2.5 million Twitter followers and more than 2.4 million Facebook fans.

In 2007, NPR Music launched as a free online music discovery destination devoted to music genres neglected by commercial media. Enriched by content from member station partners, it features live concerts and in-studio performances, interviews, reporting on-location from major music festivals and events, as well as reviews, blogs, and recommendations. The site is an influential arbiter of music tastes and trends, identifying and promoting classical, jazz and blues, rock/folk/pop, world, and urban artists. Its concerts at South by Southwest are must-hears.

More innovation is right around the corner. NPR will continue to invest in online media to ensure that our programming and stations are always relevant and compelling to audiences.

Technology Leadership

Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS)

NPR is the home of The Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), a combined satellite and internet content distribution service that distributes public radio programming and related digital content. This includes our content and the work of other program producers, including American Public Media (APM), Public Radio International (PRI), and independent public radio producers. The PRSS is managed by our Distribution Division, and its annual operations are entirely self-supporting based on the fees paid by both public and commercial clients.

Application Program Interface

In July 2008 NPR was the first major media organization to establish an open API (Application Programming Interface) to bring our content to a wider audience in a manner that is open, accessible and free. The NPR API provides a way for two computer applications to communicate in a common language so that NPR member stations, the public, and other non-profit organizations can find our content and present it on their own websites or applications.

NPR Labs

Offering innovative research and consulting services to the broadcast industry, NPR Labs is a leader in the advancement of broadcast radio technology. We are the only major broadcast organization that invests in radio technology assessment and research and development on an ongoing basis.

The Labs' engineering group is recognized internationally as a radio technology authority. In 2003 the team developed digital multicasting for HD Radio, the replacement technology for analog radio, and they conducted research and tests that led to improvements in the performance of HD technology.

Multicasting makes it possible for all radio stations - commercial and non-commercial - to offer multiple streams of programming on one channel, free to the public. More Labs-initiated innovations in digital radio are underway, including development of accessible media services for those with hearing and vision impairments.

Satellite and International Radio

Beyond the radio station network, and web and mobile services and applications, NPR programs a channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and one web-based stream. NPR also produces multiple international services heard in more than 150 countries, provides programming for Armed Services Radio and operates a radio station in Berlin.

A Brief History of NPR and Public Radio

1920's-40's

Our roots go back to the earliest days of American broadcasting. In the 1920's, many of the country's first radio stations grew up at colleges and universities who wanted to experiment with this new medium to educate and entertain the public. In the late 1940's, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allotted the lower end of the new FM band exclusively to non-commercial, educational stations, setting the stage for a major station expansion. This is where most public stations are still found today.

1950's-60's

As commercial radio began its first decline with the advent of TV, public radio grew, along with public TV. The big breakthrough came in 1967 when President Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act. This new law led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which Congress called upon to encourage ""the growth and development of non-commercial radio"" and to develop ""programming that will be responsive to the interests of the people.""

CPB introduced technical and professional standards to improve what were then mainly small stations. Soon CPB and individual stations saw the need for a national radio service to bring Johnson's vision to life.

1970's

NPR was incorporated on February 26, 1970, by 90 forward-thinking charter stations to provide national news programming. In April 1971, NPR hit the air with live coverage of the Senate hearings on the war in Vietnam. Just a month later, we debuted our first weekday newsmagazine, All Things Considered. In 1977, NPR assumed a new responsibility - to represent the interests of NPR member stations (who had grown from 90 to 190) - before Congress, the FCC and others. Our premier newsmagazine, Morning Edition, launched in 1979, signaling that NPR was becoming an all-day news service.

1980's

This was a decade of transformational and tumultuous change. NPR launched the first ever nationwide, satellite-delivered radio distribution network to serve a growing network of about 250 stations, ushering in a decade that saw an explosion in new national programs for public radio. In 1983, NPR suffered a severe financial crisis; it emerged with stronger governance and management, and an improved business model that ultimately propelled growth for both NPR and stations.

1990's

A growing interest in news - local, national and international, led to expanded distribution of NPR programming and growth in audience. The Gulf War spawned the 1991 launch of NPR's first talk program, Talk of the Nation, and ultimately, the emergence of the public radio news-talk format. NPR launched NPR Worldwide in 1993, providing programming beyond the boundaries of the U.S., and throughout the decade NPR stations expanded their services  acquiring additional stations and growing their own programming and operations. The effort in 1994 to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting led to an unprecedented burst in contributions from listeners, and a groundswell of non-partisan political support from the public. Federal support for public broadcasting was maintained.

2000's

September 11, 2001, was a turning point for NPR; a catalyst to shift our orientation even more fully to high-quality, contextual, timely news - both domestic and foreign. 9/11, Election 2004, the Iraq War, the primaries and Election 2008 led to spikes in audience, and most of these new listeners stayed with us. Over the last few years, we've extended our focus to build an equally compelling service on NPR.org, as well as mobile sites and apps. These digital platforms offer more ways to listen, learn and experience NPR and stations, and new people are discovering us every day.

Today we are experiencing another era of innovation, not unlike the earliest days of radio, though much faster, and more chaotic and dynamic. Our radio service is a strong foundation upon which to build, as NPR and its stations are actively embracing the power and potential of digital media to serve our mission.","['stations', 'media', 'programs', 'programming', 'content', 'radio', 'digital', 'overview', 'music', 'npr', 'public', 'history']"

Peering back across Harper Lee's life, it can seem impossible to distinguish the novelist from her masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee died at the age of 89 in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala., on Friday morning  yet it's clear that her legacy will live on much longer than that, through her characters and the readers who have embraced them for decades.

""America and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century's most beloved authors,"" Hank Conner, Lee's nephew, announced in a statement. ""We knew her as Nelle Harper Lee, a loving member of our family, a devoted friend to the many good people who touched her life, and a generous soul in our community and our state.""

Conner's experience, though  and the experiences of those who knew Lee personally  are exceptional. For the most part, Lee's readers have known the author only through To Kill a Mockingbird, her debut  and, for decades, her only  novel.

The book depicts the strivings of a small-town Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch, on behalf of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with raping a white woman, and it casts the events through the lens of Finch's precocious daughter, Scout. Despite its relative brevity, the book bears considerable weight, both in the gravity of its themes and the care with which it treats them.

toggle caption AP

Perhaps, then, it should be no surprise that Lee and her editor, Tay Hohoff, weren't exactly expecting this book to fly off store shelves.

Hohoff ""cautioned her that a book with racism at its center involving a rape trial was not a thing in 1960 to make people run to the bookstores for,"" says Charles J. Shields, author of Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee. ""She counselled her client and said, 'If we sell 2,500 copies and break even, you should be proud.' ""

You already know this twist: Turns out they were flat wrong.

The book all but immediately became a best-seller. (And it's gone on to sell more than 40 million copies, according to The Washington Post.) It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. Just a year later, it was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film.

What accounts for that kind of success? In many ways, it struck a chord for the very reasons Lee's editor was feeling cautious, says Mary Murphy, director of the documentary Hey, Boo: Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird.

""You know, there were two big revolutions in the '60s in this country when To Kill a Mockingbird came out: One was civil rights and the other was women's rights. And in a way, To Kill a Mockingbird speaks to both those things,"" Murphy says.

""Scout Finch at 6 enjoyed, as child growing up in the Depression, enjoyed more freedoms than most women in the '60s did. She wore pants, she swore, she played with boys, she spoke her mind,"" Murphy continues. ""And of course the Civil Rights movement: Many people I spoke to who were active in the movement said that the fact that a white Southerner wrote that book gave them hope that justice could prevail.""

And then, seemingly all at once, Lee was gone  at least, that's how the popular narrative goes. The author quietly continued to write, but she decided to step out of the spotlight. Lee did not publish another novel for more than five decades, and she refused nearly every attempt by the press to speak with her.

Naturally, there grew around her the mythology of the reclusive writer. It's a myth that Murphy says simply isn't true.

""Harper Lee was not a recluse. She was not holed up in her house like Boo Radley  unless of course, you were a reporter, and then she was not going to talk to you,"" Murphy says. ""I think that's a big distinction.""

Wayne Flynt, her friend and professor emeritus at Auburn University, says her absence had little to do with preconceived notions of her personality.

""Many people describe her as an introvert, many people explain her as being extremely shy, she was neither an introvert nor shy,"" Flynt says. ""She was a private woman, she lived very much within herself, she was quite content within herself.""

And he explains Lee's decision not to publish again  for decades  quite simply.

""I suppose what I would say is that there are some writers who have one great story to tell and they tell that one great story.""

In the meantime, that singular novel was becoming a staple on high school syllabi, a beloved text read and reread even as its era passed on into the next, and new generations picked up the book.

""The people who have To Kill a Mockingbird seared in memory  their first reading experience of To Kill a Mockingbird seared in their brain  it's the biggest book club in the world,"" Murphy says. ""I mean, for all our conversations about Facebook and social media, To Kill a Mockingbird is the biggest social media group of our time, in a way.""

Lee was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work in 2007, and a National Medal of Arts in 2010.

Then, the second twist: Last year, after some 55 years of waiting, Lee decided it was time to publish a second novel, Go Set a Watchman. The book was initially billed by many as a sequel to Mockingbird, for it shared principal characters, reviving Atticus and Scout in a setting several years later than Mockingbird's main action.

Yet, in many ways, it was less a sequel than a glimpse at what would have been, had Lee gone with her first impulses a writer rather than following her editor's advice and reworking her first drafts. For years, Hohoff had worked with Lee on radical revisions to the text, from 1957 to the book's eventual publication in 1960, according to The New York Times.

""I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told,"" Lee said in a 2015 statement.

Go Set a Watchman, then, let Lee's early visions of her definitive work find the light of day. In the process, though, it also invited significant skepticism that Lee, who had suffered a stroke in 2007, was fully in control of the decision.

Then, there were the decidedly mixed reviews.

""All I know for certain is that Go Set a Watchman is kind of a mess that will forever change the way we read a masterpiece,"" NPR's Maureen Corrigan, for one, wrote about the book when it was released in July 2015. Her assessment was by no means uncommon.

Lee's own reaction to the reviews and the controversy?

""She chortled,"" Flynt told AL.com at the time.

And herein, perhaps, rests a lesson: Despite our best attempts to confine Lee's life to the pages she wrote and the characters she created, her own life far exceeded the bounds of her book covers. Lee was more than Atticus, Scout and Tom; she was more than the author of To Kill a Mockingbird. And, perhaps, she often remembered that fact much better than the rest of us.

""She was a good companion,"" Flynt remembers. ""She had lots of people she adored.

""One thing I will say about Harper Lee: If you ever met Harper Lee, you got just exactly what you saw. She never tried to be anything her entire life except who she was.""","['life', 'lee', 'shaped', 'harper', 'text', 'mockingbird', 'murphy', 'caption', 'lees', 'book', 'kill', 'measure', 'towering', 'previous', 'twoway', 'npr']"

Jack Garratt has been called the ""sound of the year"" for 2016.

That accolade came from the BBC. In the United Kingdom, he has already won several awards for his music. His debut album, Phase, comes out today in the United States.

From the start of his musical career, Garratt has been a one-man band, playing the guitar, drums and keyboard all himself  often at the same time. Garratt grew up in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, the son of a police officer and a teacher. In 2005, at the age of 13, he entered the Junior Eurovision song contest  and came in dead last.

""That was the first time I ever put my foot in any kind of door,"" he says. ""And the door broke my foot as it slammed in my face.""

A few years later, while till writing and performing music, Garrett took a job as a teaching assistant to a boy with cerebral palsy. The experience, he says, was mind-opening  and had a profound effect on his creative work.

""He ended up teaching me a lot about losing your inhibitions when you can, and not being too stuck-up or stubborn to try new things,"" he says. ""I got to see a kid who had cerebral palsy go and hit balls harder and try and run faster than all the other kids in his year, because he wasn't going to let his mind stop him just because his legs were trying to.""

npr,,Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless,[],"Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless

Its tempting to say that weve used one word a countless number of times.

But that would be wrong, because we can quantify it:

 Countless showed up 255 times in the past year on NPR.org.

 The word is in 112 broadcast transcripts from that same period.

There are two points to make about this:

 We (and our guests) use the word too much. We cannot have found that many things that qualify as countless.

 We (and our guests) often misuse the word, either because what were talking about can be counted or because a better word would paint a clearer picture. Countless just ends up sounding like a throwaway word that conveys little information.

This is the point in this post where we should go the dictionary. The adjective countless is defined as too many to count; innumerable; myriad. If you want to make the case that youre using it as a synonym for myriad, please be prepared to prove that youre speaking of an indefinitely large number.

A pretty good use of the word was a reference we made to the countless other people around the world who showed support for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. That group could be considered an indefinitely large number. (Might millions have been a better word? Theres a case to be made that the answer is yes.)

A poor use of the word was this headline: The Countless Lives Of Lauren Bacall. The appreciation of her life that ran with the headline details about a dozen times she reinvented herself. Thats not indefinitely large.

What to say instead? A look through our reports shows that, depending on the context, more precise words would have included:

 Many

 Dozens

 Hundreds

 Thousands

 Millions

 Billions

By the way, it is not a job requirement that reporters covering the 2016 campaign always put countless before the words handshakes, pork chops, county fairs, town halls and stump speeches.

In the weeks since the world was introduced to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the full power of its diverse casting has been revealed. It has engaged millions who might have ignored the film after the prequels disappeared into the Sarlacc pit of critical disdain. It's brought a shine to the eyes of children who'd never seen their reflections in a story so grand and sweeping. And it's led already-addicted fans to talk and think differently about the franchise they love.

Much has been written about the decision to cast Nigerian-British actor John Boyega as escaped Stormtrooper FN-2187, whose race and even species are ambiguous in the film's shooting script, and the fact that two of the film's other leading heroes are played by a young woman and an actor of Guatemalan descent. It's been noted that these choices reflect today's diverse American population, expand the $30 billion franchise's potential global audience  Star Wars has accrued nearly 150 million fans around the world, making its fandom the 9th most populous nation on Earth  and make the film a truer reflection of the present and future.

Of course, change has not been welcomed by all.

But of course, change has not been welcomed by all. Among those who see the whiteness and maleness of heroes as a divine right, these casting choices triggered some of the more virulent social media reactions of recent memory, a great disturbance rippling out to the farthest reaches of pop culture.

This battle between factions  those accepting ""darkness"" in their onscreen heroes (and with it, openness, change and progress), and those stubbornly clinging to ""lightness"" (and thus psychic closure, defiant self-delusion and often plain-and-simple racism), played out multiple times throughout 2015, as other ""nontraditional"" casting choices sparked similar backlash from the uglier crevices of the Internet.

Michael B. Jordan as Fantastic Four hothead Johnny Storm? Human Torch is now black for some PC reason. Stick to the source material and stop the nonsense!

Mehcad Brooks as Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl series? Blackwashed again. Getting mighty fed up with this. Will not be watching.

And, in what must have seemed like the ultimate final straw for casting purists, Noma Dumezweni as an adult Hermione Granger in the sold-out Harry Potter stage sequel? Seriously f unhappy with this! Why do we keep changing characters' race?

Hardly any of these reactions challenged the skills or appeal of the actors in question, or whether they could play the roles effectively. Some fans simply couldn't accept that the color of an actor's skin conflicted with the character they had in their minds, underscoring that even in the genres of speculative fiction and fantasy  stories unrestricted by space, time and the limits of physics!  differences in race and ethnicity remain a twilight zone too forbidding for many otherwise imaginative individuals to traverse.

They have no problem believing a man can fly. They recoil, however, when that man is black.

They have no problem believing a man can fly. They recoil, however, when that man is black.

Of course, Caucasian audience-goers aren't the only ones accustomed to melanin-deficient heroes. Anyone who came of age on a diet of Western culture's greatest hits is susceptible to the idea that when it comes to adventure stories, people of color belong on the sidelines (or down in the underworld).

From our earliest storybook read-alouds, every princess was a ""fair maiden,"" every hero a ""white knight,"" and if there was ever a villainous vizier, diabolical demon or traitorous templar, he was invariably described as swarthy, dark or black.

Disney's animated tales often doubled down on the White Makes Right meme, with one royal named Snow White and another named Cinderella, who, invisible when darkened by the dirt and soot of her labors, cleans up as a glorious blond woman drawing every eye.

And then there were the comic books, which over my lifetime evolved from kiddie fare to adult geek obsession to mainstream blockbuster fodder. Who doesn't know the story of Superman, that musclebound alien from another planet who somehow managed to end up looking like a plausible cousin to Don Draper?

Those of us who loved comics accepted that the caped crusaders of our four-color pulp fantasies  no matter how mutant or alien or non-humanoid their backstories  had to be rendered in shades of pale, because that's what the pages in our sweaty little palms told us to do.

There is no sadder example of this suspension of disbelief than a recent New York Times op-ed by Malaysian radio host Umapagan Ampikaipakan titled ""That Oxymoron, the Asian Comic Superhero."" In it, Ampikaipakan questioned the wisdom of the ""current push to draw diversity into comics.

Growing up in Malaysia, Ampikaipakan and his childhood friends were ""brown and yellow,"" he writes, ""but we didn't mind that our role models were all white."" In fact, rendering them otherwise might have been destructive, potentially ""undercutting the genre's universal appeal.""

That appeal was rooted in notions of the American dream  that is to say, the Anglo-American dream, red for courage, blue for truth, and white, well, because to Ampikaipakan and to all of us raised in a postcolonial cultural context, white is often the default shade associated with people who are heroic and good and just.

Despite the increasing volume of calls to diversify pop culture, Ampikaipakan's view remains the dominant one in media and entertainment. Whiteness remains universal, all-encompassing, ""normal."" To make a protagonist any other race or ethnicity requires an accounting for one's actions.

Take a look at what happened when Sony remade the classic musical Annie, based on the classic comic strip Little Orphan Annie, with African-American actors Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx in lead roles. The endeavor was bombarded with complaints and questions about why a ""black Annie"" was necessary. ""I wanna live in a colorless world but I will not stand for a black Annie. #EnoughSaid,"" tweeted one skeptic.

But here's the thing: reimagining classic characters as non-white may not always be as much of a stretch as the purists would have you believe. Take a closer look at some of the most popular comics franchises out here, and if you cock your head ever so slightly, you'll start to wonder if white really is the only color that matches these stories.

For starters, set aside the way Joe Shuster and hundreds of comics artists since have rendered Superman, and take another look at the hero's backstory: a dark-haired refugee from a distant, exotic place, where people have weird, hyphenated names like Jor-El and Lor-Van. Once he arrives in America, he is transracially (trans-specially?) adopted by parents in the Heartland, and raised to ""fit in"" with everyone else, but also to preserve and appreciate his hidden heritage.

He moves to the big city, where he hides behind dorky glasses and displays a humble, passive persona to his coworkers. But in his spare time, he embraces his true self, gathers with others like himself and lets it all hang out.

To sum up? That dude Asian.

A similar case can be made for Spider-Man, a dark-haired, glasses-wearing nerd named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider on a science field trip. Consider that Parker has always been depicted as being from Queens, home to the largest Korean-American community on the East Coast, and you could imagine his secret identity as ""Peter Park"" instead.

(Marvel may have had the same thought: In 2014, the company introduced a Korean-American member of the Spider-fam: Cindy Moon, better known as Silk, who got her powers from the very same spider that transformed Peter Park. Er, Parker.)

And then there's The Hulk, the alter ego of a nuclear physicist who in an instant goes from celebrated scientist to accused traitor, hunted by the government, charged with allowing a top-secret weapon of mass destruction to escape U.S. military hands.

When I think of The Hulk's origin story, I can't help but recall the cases of Wen Ho Lee, Xiaoxing Xi, and other Asian-American scientists who, in recent history, saw their careers transformed in a flash when they were accused of spying for China and hounded by federal prosecutors, charges that were in several cases later dropped (and linked to racial profiling).

The point of these thought experiments is that, contrary to what defenders of wall-to-wall whiteness in pop culture will have you believe, it's not impossible to imagine heroes of color  or to reimagine existing heroes as another color. And in fact, when we do so, it can move storytelling forward, into unexpected, undiscovered, unexplored territories.

And isn't that what these genres are all about?

A new hope

Of course, with the unknown comes fear and anxiety. For a lot of ""traditionalist"" sci-fi and fantasy fans, the big worry seems to be that heroes who look like, well, everybody else will somehow become inaccessible and unrelatable. (Of course, those of us who grew up non-white can testify that it's possible to empathize with someone you don't look like.)

And it's absolutely true: rethinking the default whiteness of heroic stories will fundamentally change them. Done properly, however, this can bring fresh energy, new texture and unexpected resonance to stories that have become hidebound, and free them from genre conventions that have become stifling.

For example, the revelation that FN-2187 is black opens up all sorts of intriguing potential backstory for the First Order's Stormtrooper army. Most of the imagery associated with the First Order is inspired by Nazi Germany: The salutes, the uniforms, enormous rallies under giant red and black banners, the embrace of genocidal ""Final Solutions,"" the term ""stormtrooper"" itself.

That's nothing new. In popular culture, the Nazi aesthetic has long served as the signpost of ultimate evil, so much so that the Internet is littered with essays decrying this cinematic reductio ad Hitlerum cliche.

But unlike prior generations of Imperial soldiers, the First Order's stormtroopers aren't clones. FN-2187 and his fellow legionnaires are forced conscripts, abducted as young children from their home planets. The fact that the First Order's overseers are depicted as white humans, while the only Stormtrooper whose face we've seen is an abducted and enslaved black man, provides an opening. It raises a whole host of unsettling and fascinating new questions about what the First Order wants, and how it works, that future episodes will have a chance to answer.

All of this adds specificity and gravity to the arousal of FN-2187's conscience, and his eventual emergence as Finn, our hero. Yet his quest for freedom and thirst for redemption remain unquestionably universal. They span not just galaxies, but time itself. And of course, we shouldn't discount Boyega's performance: It's brilliantly deft, fresh and fun to watch  arguably the film's most nuanced and human turn.

That's what diverse characters, performers, and creators can bring to the page, the stage and the screen. Having a wider and deeper pool of options makes it more likely that you'll discover breakthrough talent like Star Wars's Boyega, who's not only a fabulous actor, but also wields the power to transform any story he touches in fresh, exhilarating ways.

There's also evidence that diverse storytellers can perform a sort of Jedi Mind Trick on us, the audience, helping over time to flush out the toxic abscesses of racial fear, hate and scorn that continue to plague America.

Take a recent study of 2,000 people who watched the web comedy series Halal in the Family, a sitcom parody featuring The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi as the patriarch of a Muslim-American family. The study, which was commissioned by the creators of the show and conducted by researchers from Seton Hall, the University of Washington, and New York University, found that after watching the show, viewers had more favorable associations toward Muslim Americans, and less unconscious bias against them.

That's not the only research showing that diversity in pop culture has real-world impact. MIT professor Edward Schiappa found that after watching shows with queer protagonists  Will & Grace, Six Feet Under and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  subjects were more likely to disagree with anti-gay statements and to see queer individuals more positively.

There's a good chance that your actual social network doesn't include people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Surprisingly, even in an era of global digital connectivity, 91 percent of the average white American's friends are white. But on-screen protagonists can serve as something like friend proxies, providing what researchers call ""parasocial relationships"" that help to (literally) color one's perspective on reality.

When we see characters who we perceive as ""different"" getting to do all the things human beings do in real life  kick butt in their careers, goof around with their kids  or go beyond, reaching for the stars and bending the universe to their will, it changes how we look at ""different"" people in the real world.

""At this point, it's a pretty unequivocal finding that TV can affect how people feel and think about others,"" Schiappa told Code Switch last year. ""When you're exposed to a wide variety of people in a certain minority group,"" he said, ""your ideas about that group get more complicated.""

The bottom line is that enriching pop culture with heroes of all colors, cultures, genders and identities doesn't just make stories better  it may have the power to ultimately makes us better as well.

""A black Stormtrooper, or a female Jedi, or even a suburban Muslim dad at first confound us, and then become unremarkable,"" says Mik Moore, one of the creators of Halal in the Family. ""They provide evidence of what's possible.""

A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, it might have made sense to imagine that heroes had to look a certain way. That era is gone forever. There has been an awakening  and it's time for the Force to come to balance.

i toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

Earlier this week, officials at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore announced they had received approval to begin conducting the first organ transplants from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients. This comes after a 2013 change in the law that lifted a ban in place since 1988.

Surgeons at Johns Hopkins say that they are ready to begin performing liver and kidney transplants as soon as the appropriate candidates are available.

NPR's Michel Martin spoke with Dr. Dorry Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who has worked for years to allow these kinds of organ transplants.

Interview Highlights

On how the issue came to his attention

About five or six years ago, we were really ramping up, both at our center and nationally, transplanting patients with HIV. So HIV had totally changed as a disease from basically a death sentence in the '80s to now something that's a chronic disease, people live their lives with it. They just need to take antiretroviral medication.

We're seeing now kidney failure, liver failure and the need for transplantation in these patients. As we were ramping up, we're putting more and more people on a waiting list. Now, as you know, the waiting list has about 120,000 people on it, so that's kind of a depressing line to wait in. And at the same time it occurred to me that we were throwing away organs that were infected with HIV, that could be used to help people with HIV  because of this antiquated law. So it occurred to me, living 30 minutes north of Capitol Hill, that maybe we should do something about this.

On how he started the campaign to change the law

The first thing we did was estimate what the impact would be of a law like this. So we did a study to try to estimate how many potential HIV-positive deceased donors there would be. And it turns out that it's about 500 per year. So if you think about 500 donors per year  deceased donors  that's over 1,000 organs, so that's over 1,000 lives saved. And if that were to happen it would be the biggest increase in transplantation that we've seen in the last decade.

When we thought about it that way, we thought: This is highly impactful. And so we published this, we got some media attention for it. And then we got groups from the HIV community, the transplant community, the medical community, patient advocacy groups  they all joined us in our effort. We wrote a bill that would become the HOPE Act, the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act, and started to do what they taught us on Schoolhouse Rock.

On why organ donations from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients was illegal in the first place

This was kind of a quirk of timing. The big congressional law that oversees organ transplantation in the United States that really organized our transplant system came about in the mid-'80s. And the mid-'80s happened to be the AIDS scare and at that time AIDS was basically a death sentence. So it was written into that law at the congressional level  not the policy level, but the statute level  that we can't use organs infected with HIV. And so that stood during the entire AIDS scare.

On who receives these organs and what factors they consider

The plan is HIV-positive organs can go into HIV-positive patients. And then we would be selective about who the right donors are, who the right recipients are and how we can properly match them so that somebody doesn't get, for example, a much more aggressive strain of HIV.

We think that superinfection is a reality and is something we're going to have to deal with. But if you think about it, if you have a pretty unaggressive strain of HIV and we know that the donor you're getting the organ from was also controlled on the same meds that you're taking, then you will probably remain controlled when you get that organ.

Basically it would be just like all the other compatibilities we consider in transplant.

On who benefits

Imagine now we take hundreds or maybe thousands of people off of the list, then everybody behind them moves forward. So people with HIV are benefited directly and everybody else on the list is benefited indirectly. And we're all very excited to get started.

How he feels about the announcement

I'm thrilled that this is possible. I'm thrilled that Congress was receptive to this, that President Obama signed the bill. I'm thrilled that we are now able to do this for people. But I'm most thrilled that now patients with HIV on the waiting list will have a better chance at life.","['donors', 'begin', 'set', 'hiv', 'organ', 'transplants', 'thrilled', 'johns', 'list', 'hopkins', 'patients', 'shots', 'hivpositive', 'organs', 'law', 'thats']"

npr,,Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air,[],"Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air

There was a good discussion this week among correspondents and editors in the New York bureau about whether we can use some offensive language in podcasts that we cant on the air.

The immediate question was this (NOTE: sensitive readers may find the next sentence objectionable):

Can we call an asshole an asshole?

The answer was no, we dont want an NPR correspondent to say that on a podcast.

The process, by the way, worked. A correspondent consulted his editor. The editor consulted his boss and the Standards & Practices noodge. A case was made, consideration was given and a decision was reached that everyone understood.

This is a good time to ask: How do we feel about offensive language in podcasts?

As an organization, we respect our audience and set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive.

That line was originally written about what we say on the air, but we made clear three years ago when the Ethics Handbook was published that the bar applies to our other platforms as well:

Online, if sound or text containing potentially offensive language has been approved for use by a Managing Editor or someone above that level, it too must be preceded by text (and in the case of audio, a verbal warning as well) advising the NPR.org audience that what follows contains language some may find offensive.

The environment is changing quickly. Some very popular podcasts do not worry about whether their language might offend. Their hosts conversational and sometimes profane ways of speaking are probably pulling in far more listeners than they repel.

We dont want to seem boring and out-of-step. We do want to sound like America. But, the bar that NPR journalists need to get over before using such language themselves has to be set incredibly high  so high, in fact, that its almost impossible to get over.

Were professional communicators at a major news organization. What we say and write in public reflects on NPR. No matter what platform were using or where were appearing, we should live up to our own standards. Yes, theres more room in podcasts to let guests speak freely and for our journalists to be looser with their language. But it doesnt mean NPR correspondents are free to use words or phrases in podcasts that they would never use on the air.

We should always be the news outlet that revels in language. There are so many wonderful words. Use them!

The most common offensive words and phrases are among the least creative ways of expressing yourself. Theyre akin to cliches in the sense that theyre easy ways out. We pride ourselves on using words that pop out because theyre funny, provocative, rarely heard or just perfect. Again, use them!

You may be asking: Who needs to sign off on what is permissible language in a podcast, what does and does not need to be bleeped and what kind of warnings need to be given to listeners? The people to consult are: the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott).

npr,,Guidance On The Words Protests And Protesters,[],"Guidance On The Words Protests And Protesters

Please avoid referring to the people in Baltimore who have injured police officers, started fires, looted stores and vandalized properties as simply protesters.

Reports from Baltimore indicate that some people are taking advantage of the situation to lash out at authorities or to grab what they can from businesses. Those are not just protesters in the sense of the word that normally comes to mind.

Likewise, it is too simple to say that protests turned violent. That paints a picture of a peaceful gathering that changed into a rock-throwing, tear-gas flying confrontation between citizens and police. Reports from Baltimore indicate thats not been the case in many instances.

As in other cases weve discussed, its wise to avoid labels. In this case, protesters is a label thats too broad. The better approach is to focus on action words and describe whats been happening.

On a Newscast this morning, Dave Mattingly said that rioting [in Baltimore] yesterday injured 15 police officers. More than a dozen buildings and nearly 150 vehicles were set on fire. He noted that the violence followed the funeral for 25-year-old Freddie Gray.

Korva Coleman used similar language, saying that Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency in Baltimore, after rioting broke out yesterday. ... Some residents started fires and clashed with police.

Morning Edition introduced a report from Jennifer Ludden with this language:

Lets go directly to Baltimore, this morning. Thats where people threw cinder blocks at police and set stores on fire. They did all that after the funeral for a black man who died in police custody. NPRs Jennifer Ludden is tracking the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray. Jennifer, whats it like in Baltimore?

LABELS AND WHY ITS WISE TO AVOID THEM

 Immigrants.

 Medical conditions.

 Teenager.

 Victims vs. survivors. (Particularly in cases of sexual assault.)

Update at 9:55 a.m. ET:

We should also avoid saying that Freddie Gray died while in police custody. He had been arrested, so he had been taken into custody. But it was a week after his arrest, and he was in a hospital, when he died. The phrase in police custody calls to mind someone who is in a jail cell, or who is in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser.

Between the release of Yuck's self-titled 2010 debut and the arrival of its 2013 follow-up, Glow & Behold, lead singer and chief songwriter Daniel Blumberg left the London grunge-pop band. Those duties then fell on guitarist Max Bloom, who was tasked with righting the ship and managing the expectations of a fan base that had fallen in love with Yuck's expert re-purposing of '90s indie-rock influences.

It was the kind of moment that most bands don't survive. But here we are with a third Yuck album, Stranger Things, in which Bloom and his colleagues  bassist Mariko Doi, guitarist Edward Hayes and drummer Jonathan Rogoff  employ a back-to-basics approach. Recording at home on a shoestring budget, they benefit greatly from the twin luxuries of creative control and isolation. Yuck leaps out of the blocks with the fuzzed-out bass and lighter-in-hand sway of ""Hold Me Closer,"" as well as the playfulness of ""Cannonball."" But once the group gets to the title track, you can almost sense the new Yuck snapping into place.

Time will tell whether it's the weight of expectations being lifted or merely a shift in influences  Archers Of Loaf and Superchunk swapped out for Teenage Fanclub and Real Estate  but Stranger Things marks that moment where the band stops playing to the room and starts speaking directly to listeners. With no outside forces pushing the band, ""As I Walk Away"" and ""Down"" achieve a lightness that's new to Yuck but suits the group well.

""Yr Face"" closes Stranger Things with a crowd-pleaser that could pass for a Built To Spill outtake; it's attacked with such wide-open, spaced-out fuzz, it sounds like an eternal set-closer. It's the kind of song Yuck does best: The band may not make the rules, but it knows just how to tweak them for maximum emotional resonance.","['kind', 'yuck', 'stranger', 'things', 'guitarist', 'expectations', 'band', 'moment', 'yucks', 'group']"

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

One of our favorite guests is scientist, talk-show host and raconteur Neil deGrasse Tyson. He joined us just a few months ago to talk about how he likes to relax.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Thank you, thank you.

SAGAL: Great to have you. You are perhaps a hero - no, not perhaps, definitely a hero to the great, as you like to put it, geek-averse (ph), all the science geeks and nerds and science-fiction readers. And you seemed to spend a lot of time stamping down our fantasies. There aren't aliens, Pluto's not a planet, that sort of stuff.

TYSON: Well, no, it's a reality check on your fantasies. And there's plenty else to fantasize about. I'm not totally closing the doors on all of your fantasies. You know, there's black holes and what - could there be wormholes? Could - might there be a multi-verse? These are all fascinating frontiers. What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? And what was around before the universe? And do we have access to higher dimensions? So..

FAITH SALIE: Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going, Neil.

SAGAL: Now, one of your famous incidents or contributions to pop culture was when you criticized the movie ""Titanic,"" now a few years old...

TYSON: Yeah.

SAGAL: ...For showing the wrong stars in the sky after the ship sank. And it's interesting because while they were drowning, none of the people noticed that, but you did and I appreciate that. And famously, when James Cameron redid the film, he added some effects, he changed the stars. But you do - do you do that a fair bit? Do you go to movies and, like, well that couldn't happen.

TYSON: See, I think I'm misunderstood when I post these comments about films. So here is Kate Winslet sitting on - you know, laying on this plank. This ship is down. She let her boyfriend drown. They didn't even try a second time to get him to float on that with her. So I'm angry by that, I think...

SAGAL: I - you know, I've - I admire you, personally and professionally. I ain't never going to the movies with you.

TYSON: No, no, no, let me tell you - I'm going to tell you - hear me out. Watch, so there she is, looking up at the night sky and the night sky is not only wrong, which I noticed in an instant. But later, on closer analysis, I revealed that the left half of the sky was a mirror reflection of the right half of the sky. Now that - now, excuse me, please, that's not only wrong.

ADAM FELBER: It's lazy.

TYSON: ...It's lazy.

SAGAL: You are getting - you are getting kind of agitated.

MAZ JOBRANI: No, I don't blame him.

SAGAL: And I am just going to say...

TYSON: No, no, but I am not the most annoying person to bring to a movie 'cause I basically hold it in and write about it later or tweet about it. The most annoying people to bring to movies, I think we all agree, are those who read the book first.

SAGAL: Oh, yes.

TYSON: Get them all out of the movie theater.

FELBER: Objectively true.

SAGAL: We are the worst.

TYSON: I don't need to hear, oh, that character wasn't developed right. Oh, they left out a - shut up already. Leave me alone. Stay the hell home.

SAGAL: (Laughter) One last question. As perhaps the nation's best-known astrophysicist or scientist of all kind - of any kind - do you agree that planetarium shows are much better when you're high?

(LAUGHTER)

TYSON: Maybe that's not the right question. Maybe the question is, is everything better when you're high?

SAGAL: Neil deGrasse Tyson, is everything better when you're high?

(APPLAUSE)

TYSON: Just - in all seriousness, personally, when I'm in the dome and I'm looking up - or...

SAGAL: Yeah.

TYSON: ...More realistically, when I'm on a mountaintop looking up at the universe, there's a certain euphoria that descends upon me...

SAGAL: Yes.

TYSON: ...That I'm betting that any other chemical version of that, it will just pale relative to the real thing. So I derive my high from the highest things there are. And that is the observable edge of the known universe.

JOBRANI: Nice.

SALIE: Wow.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: I will do that. I will go to a mountaintop. I'm going to do it in Colorado just to have a backup.

TYSON: Good one, I caught that.

SAGAL: Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, you're smart.

JOBRANI: Were you on one of those mountaintops looking up when you were like, wait a minute, the ""Titanic"" doesn't work, the movie?

TYSON: No, I knew the sky. I didn't have to, like, recheck the sky after it. I got it in my head.

SAGAL: He knows it. All right.

TYSON: Who do you think you're talking to?

SAGAL: We can...

JOBRANI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Anyway, we could, in fact, talk to you all day 'cause it's so great. But Neil deGrasse Tyson, we have asked you here to play a game this time we're calling...

BILL KURTIS: How About A Bob? It'll Frame Your Face so Nicely.

SAGAL: You are a famed expert on cosmology, but what do you know about cosmetology?

(LAUGHTER)

TYSON: OK.

SAGAL: Answer 2 of these 3 questions about hairstylists and other spa experts from around the world, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners, the voice of our scorekeeper Carl Kasell on their voicemail. Bill, who is Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson playing for?

KURTIS: Jean Bentley of Bristol, Tenn.

SAGAL: All right, here's your first question. I guess at this point we say let's see how smart you really are.

TYSON: OK.

SAGAL: Cosmetologists, despite what you may think, are no pushovers. When a robber tried to rob the women taking classes at a Louisiana beauty school in 2006, how did those students respond? A, they beat him up with curling irons, B, they did the old hairspray and cigarette lighter trick, chasing him away with bursts of flame or C, they put a cops hat on a wig stand and scared him into leaving.

TYSON: Wow, I don't know why a beauty salon would have a cop's hat and the curling irons are not deadly unless they're still plugged in and they're hot. So I'm not quite sure about that. But I don't know who remembers anymore that you can ignite spray cans, plus there aren't really any spray cans anymore 'cause that was destroying the ozone layer. So I'm - actually, I'll have to go with they chased him with the curling irons.

SAGAL: My God, he did it with science. You're right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: The most amazing thing I've ever seen. So that was very good. Next question, the hot new spa treatment over in Bali is which of these? A, you are covered with house paint, which is allowed to harden, and then peeled off, taking toxins with it, B, the python massage, in which snakes crawl all over you. It's exfoliating or C, instead of hot rocks, hot lava is dripped onto your back.

TYSON: Oh, wow, OK, so the only kind of lava that exists is hot. Just (laughter)...

(LAUGHTER)

TYSON: And it is hot enough to - it's way hotter than hot wax or even the hot rocks. It would basically vaporize a hole through your body, so it'd be a one-time treatment.

(LAUGHTER)

TYSON: I would say - and paint doesn't peel unless it's acrylic paint, so maybe it is acrylic paint that they're using, not oil paint. So let me say yes, it would be acrylic house paint, which, when it dries, peels very nicely. So let's go with that.

SAGAL: Ha, ha, we fooled you. It was the python treatment.

JOBRANI: Whoa.

SAGAL: I actually - I...

TYSON: The python.

SAGAL: The python treatment, yes. It costs about 50 bucks. If you're in Bali, you can go for it. This is very exciting. If you get this last one right, you win. Let's say you don't like snakes, well just jet on over to Thailand where you can get what? Is it A, a one-hour foot massage from an inmate at the Chiang Mai Correctional Institution, B, a haircut from a skilled artisan wielding a power saw or C, a manicure from a monitor lizard trained to love the taste of fingernails.

TYSON: Wow, monitor lizards are pretty gnarly creatures. I want to go with the monitor lizard. That's just weird enough to be true. No?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There - I'm at a conundrum because you're wrong. But if I tell you you're wrong, would it destroy your career and credibility? Would this be, like, your Waterloo? Like, he was doing so...

TYSON: (Laughter) I love being wrong 'cause that means in that instant, I learned something new that day.

SAGAL: You did. Well, in that case, I'll let you know 'cause you enjoy it, that, in fact, the answer was the inmate. The one-hour foot massage. You can't train a monitor lizard to chew on fingernails, come now.

TYSON: You know, animals - who - you know, I've seen animals eat worse, so...

SAGAL: (Laughter) In fact, this is - Chiang Mai Correctional facility is for women in Thailand. And this is one of the things they do for rehabilitation and job training. You can go in there, get a massage. The reviews on Trip Advisor say it's quite lovely. So how did - Bill, how did Neil deGrasse Tyson do on our quiz?

KURTIS: This is very, very interesting. You need two right answers out of three to win. Actually, Neil, you just got one.

TYSON: Oh, wow, OK. So that's how the arithmetic works on this one, OK.

SAGAL: Yeah, pretty much.

KURTIS: You know, nobody goes away empty-handed. And we're honored to have you...

TYSON: But somebody's not getting a Carl Kasell...

SAGAL: I have to say, this is a strange moment because, as listeners know, I usually like people to win and I often give hints, but I was so pleased by the idea of fooling you that - Neil deGrasse Tyson - so, like, by doing this, I therefore, by the rule of succession, become the smartest person in the world.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I have slain the dragon - you know, it's like...

TYSON: So I look - I look at it differently. I look at had I gotten all three right...

SAGAL: Yeah.

TYSON: ...I would've learned nothing. But having gotten two wrong, I learned two things today.

JOBRANI: Wow.

SAGAL: There you go.

KURTIS: There's a lesson.

SAGAL: Neil deGrasse Tyson is the Emmy-nominated host of National Geographic's ""Star Talk."" Dr. Tyson, thank you so much for joining us.

i toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP

Days after Apple's CEO wrote an open letter to customers, the head of the FBI responded with his own message, urging those involved to ""take a deep breath and stop saying the world is ending.""

FBI Director James Comey made his case in a blog post on the Lawfare web site that was published Sunday night, the latest exchange in a battle over the FBI's attempts to get Apple to unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.

The FBI leader's post comes as Apple faces a court-issued deadline to formally respond to the FBI's request for help by this Friday.

""We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land,"" Comey wrote, later adding, ""Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

Over the weekend, it emerged that shortly after government officials obtained the iPhone Farook used, a San Bernardino County employee working with federal authorities reset the password for its iCloud account  meaning the phone could no longer perform an automatic wireless backup that could have enabled Apple to recover information.

Hours after Comey's message went online, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to his employees saying the company is trying to ensure the data security of ""hundreds of millions of law-abiding people"" and avoid setting a ""dangerous precedent that threatens everyone's civil liberties.""

Apple also posted a page to answer questions about the case, on which it calls for the FBI to withdraw its demand for help opening the phone  and for the government to ""form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.""

That remark echoes a sentiment in Comey's post, in which he urged Americans to have a ""long conversation"" about technology, saying it ""creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure: privacy and safety.""

He added:

""That tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living. It also should not be resolved by the FBI, which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.""

The message comes less than a week after Apple opposed a federal judge's order to help the government unlock the iPhone in question. In an open letter addressed to Apple's customers, CEO Tim Cook wrote:

""While we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.""

Apple says that in order to comply with the judge's order, it would have to create something that doesn't currently exist: a software tool that could potentially unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.

The FBI has linked its request to the ongoing investigation into the San Bernardino shootings, but as the Two-Way reported last week, ""Apple and the federal government have been arguing about encryption for years.""

There is a wide range of opinion about whether Apple should comply with the latest request, as a listen to today's Morning Edition proves.

Philip Mudd, a former counterintelligence analyst who has worked for both the FBI and the CIA, tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that Apple should help investigators break into the phone  with one key condition: ""I don't believe they should tell the government how they did it. They should hand over the data, but not compromise themselves by giving the government the method by which they broke the code.""

When reminded that Apple has rejected that idea by saying it would create a precedent that could be abused by governments or hackers, Mudd responds, in part:

""I would say we've done this for decades, with emails and phone information before the age of smartphones  and nobody said that fundamentally violated American rights. So I don't know why smartphones are so much different than issuing a court order to say, Verizon or to Google for email information.""

To give us a sense of what regular Americans think of the dispute, Frank Morris of member station KCUR in Kansas City filed a report for Morning Edition.

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

When Susan Cain wrote Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking in 2012, it was a big success. The book made the cover of Time magazine, spent weeks on the New York Times best-sellers list and was the subject of one of the most-watched TED Talks, with more than 13 million views.

From that grew The Quiet Revolution, a company Cain co-founded that continues to produce and share content about, and for, introverts. The site offers an online training course for parents and stories submitted by readers about being introverted. There's even a podcast.

Kids, Cain says, ""are at the heart and center of it.""

""Introverts often are really amazing, talented, gifted, loving children, and they feel like there's something wrong with them,"" she says. ""And our mission is to make it so that the next generation of kids does not grow up feeling that way.""

In her latest book, Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths of Introverts, she's taking her message about introverts to teenagers. Though the book is written for young adults, it's also a tool for teachers and parents.

I talked with Cain about her mission of supporting introverts, and asked her advice on how to teach them.

So what does it mean to be an introverted child?

It's really not different for a child than for an adult. It's a person who feels at their best and at their most alive when they're in quieter, more mellow environments. And it stems from a neurobiological difference between introverts and extroverts. Literally, different nervous systems. Introverts have nervous systems that simply react more to everything that's going on around them, and that means they feel more in their sweet spot when there's less stuff happening. And extroverts have nervous systems that react less, which means that they don't get to their sweet spot until there's more stuff happening. And so this is why you see these different behavioral preferences. An introverted kid would rather draw quietly or would rather play their favorite sport with one or two other kids. A more extroverted child would rather be part of a big gang and a big noisy birthday party, and not only not be fazed by it but seem to really relish all that stimulation.

And it's different from being shy?

It is different. Shyness is much more about the fear of being judged. It's a kind of self-consciousness and not wanting people to look at you and feeling easily embarrassed or easily shamed. These are all the feelings that a shy child would have. And in practice, many introverted children are also shy, but many are not, and you can also have children that are quite extroverted but who are shy, and as soon as they overcome their shyness, you see them being in the middle of the big gang. So it's really important when you're working with children to understand what is actually happening inside them so that you make sure that you're responding to the right thing.

So let's talk about schools. Where do they come in?

You know, lots of schools are really hungry for information on how they can do a better job of working with these kids.

They're asking good questions: What indeed are the right ways to think about class participation? And are we over-evaluating as an educational culture? We overvalue the person who raises their hand all the time. Why is that important? Do we overvalue in quantity, as opposed to quality, of participation? Are there ways to think about class participation differently? Like we [at Quiet Revolution] have been encouraging schools to think in terms of classroom engagement rather than participation. Take a more holistic way of looking at how a child is engaging with this material or with their classmates.

Grant Snider/Dial Books for Young Readers

One of the anecdotes I loved in the book was when the teacher had her students think for a minute before answering. What other kind of good ideas or tips can teachers use like that?

Another idea is the think/pair/share technique, which I think many teachers are familiar with already, but may not realize the power of it within a population of students. This is a technique where the teacher asks the students a question; asks them to think about the answer. They pair up with another student to talk about their reflections. And then, once they're paired, once they've articulated it with that partner, then you ask each pair to share their thoughts with the room as a whole. And this does a lot of great things for introverted kids. No. 1, it gives them the time to process. No. 2, it allows them to get the experience of articulating their thoughts out loud. But in front of only one other student, they don't have to do it in front of the whole class. And then, often, once they have had that warmup period with one other student, they're then much more likely to want to share with the whole class.

So this is a technique that works, it works equally well for introverts and extroverts. It's great for the extroverts, too, but it just happens to work well with the more reticent kids.

What do you think about using social media or technology in the classroom? Helpful for introverts? Harmful?

Helpful. Well, of course social media is such a big thing, so for introverts, there are pros and cons. But my first impulse is to say helpful, and there are teachers now who are starting to incorporate social media into their classrooms and report that the more reticent children are much more likely to participate when their means of expression is through their screens. They can type their answer into a screen, the other students then see what they have written or typed or whatever, and then ""real life"" dialogue begins based on the initial ideas that were contributed through the screen.

So in general I'm a big fan of social media. I think incorporating it creatively into the class can work. If we're talking about it as an educational technique, then I am all for it.

This brings me to another school-related trauma: the public speech. Should teachers kind of push introverts along, out of their comfort zone?

Yeah, so I think that it's important, of course. The key, if we're talking about public speaking or really anything that kids are fearful of, is to think of anxiety levels on a scale of 1 to 10, and to make sure you're pushing kids within a zone of 4 to 6.

If you have a kid who is really freaking out, they're really in that 7-to-10 zone, it's just too dangerous to push them at that point. They might succeed, they might, you know, do well and feel this is great. But there's too big a risk of it backfiring and the experience going poorly and the fear being further codified in their brain.

So you're much better off meeting a fear in small steps. The answer is not: 'OK, you never have to do ... ' The Answer is: ""OK. You're afraid of public speaking. Why don't you prepare your speech and work on it first with your best friend?""

Give the speech to your friend. And then, when you've done that, maybe you can give it to another, smaller group. From there, you work up in stages, to finally giving the all out speech. You look for ways to make the experience less anxiety producing.

In the book, you mention that loving the topic can help kids get into their speech.

Making sure that the child is speaking about a subject that they're truly passionate about and excited to speak about is important. Because again, this is ... biochemical. If you tap into your body's behavioral activation system by speaking about something you're excited about, then that overcomes the body's behavioral inhibition system. Which is the system in your body telling you, stop. Slow down. Get the heck off the stage. So it does require extra work on the part of the teacher and an extra degree of thought and care, which I recognize is not always easy, you know, for overburdened teachers. But it goes a long way.

What about group work? Is that good for introverts?

In my experience, it depends a lot on how the group is structured. How carefully it's structured. Because I've seen group work where it works really well, you've got kids who work well together, everybody knows their role. That can be a really positive experience. And then I've seen big free-for-all groups where it's Lord of The Flies and you've got the most dominant kids taking over. Everyone else is checked out. So it can really go both ways.","['kids', 'introverts', 'power', 'big', 'work', 'quiet', 'theyre', 'youre', 'parents', 'teachers', 'nurture', 'really', 'think', 'theres']"

There is new music from Quilt and that makes me happy. The band's third album, which is out next week on Feb. 26, is called Plaza, and its winsome, wandering electric folk thrills my late-1960s soul. The songs on Plaza, a combination of brand new material and newly invigorated older tunes, often revolve around place and family. We asked Anna Fox Rochinski (vocals/guitars), Shane Butler (vocals/guitars) and John Andrews (drums/vocals) to tell us how they were made. Below, you can listen to every song on the new album, alongside comments from band members about how each one was made.

1. Passersby

""This song was written several years ago. It is meant to be a simple reflection on the passing strangers in a public space, with lush orchestration and an alternate guitar tuning to give it a darker atmosphere. The lyrics of the song are built around a fleeting moment of eye contact with a stranger in passing- ""knowing eyes of passersby gaze into mine"". I think of it as a soundscape with a little poem inside of it.""  Anna

2. Roller

""Roller was one of the last songs written for Plaza. I wrote it at my house in upstate N.Y. during the winter, which was long and snowy and often fell below zero degrees. The song itself is very upbeat and poppy but much of its lyrical content is very sad. Feeling stuck, frustrated with a partner or any kind of relationship, or just other people in general. Being a 'roller' is a sensation that lies somewhere between claiming strength for yourself but also hiding to protect yourself from the human bullshit of the world. Like, 'Yo, I got this, let me do my thing' Haha. Taking time for yourself to recalibrate your life, cruising through your experiences with your head on your shoulders, not being so affected by other people. I wrote the guitar solo in the middle to sound kind of woozy and like a normal guitar solo that had had one too many beers. The ""bridge"" is at the end of the song, and doesn't really have a conclusion, but opens it back up... 'Please, you've got me hiding out, and I can't quite seem to make a noise about it.'""  Anna

3. Searching For

""'Searching For' is a song that was written between New York and Atlanta over 2015. For the lyrics I was thinking a lot about 'home' while being temporarily displaced and technically without one over the whole of 2014 touring for Held In Splendor. I was considering moving back to the city after being away for many years. I moved to the city when I was 14 years old, from upstate New York, and then away from it to Boston when I was 18. In my experience it's just this weird place that is always changing and always staying the same, which makes its aura of 'home' pretty odd.

""I do like to joke [that] the song is about google searches, though ... haha, maybe it is on some level. I was definitely thinking a lot about social media at the time, so that's not out of the question. The whole bridge references that 'living on your own stage' idea. I mean, it's an age old concept [that] just has a whole new meaning these days with all our little gadgets and profiles. All this put on some nostalgia glasses for when I was a teenager and writing more punk-derivative songs. I was missing that part of myself a bit. Bands like The Urinals and The Clean were definitely dancing around my thoughts a lot during this time. We kinda just started riffing all together in Atlanta and the whole song got filled out pretty quick, everyone adding their arrangements naturally.""  Shane

4. O'Connor's Barn

""This song is a true mishmash of bits. The opening guitar lines which repeat throughout are something Shane and I just weirdly played together one day in summer '14, so we just stuck it in there. The verses and bridge I had written like three years ago or something, and I felt really relieved that they finally found a home. John wrote the chorus during preproduction and came up with these magically fitting lyrics, and we all stitched the whole thing together. I love Shane's zippy guitar line thing in the verses; it reminds me of the Talking Heads.

""The lyrics are inspired by my love for short stories, particularly Raymond Carver, and just the whole experience of sitting down with a book of short stories and briefly entering and exiting little worlds. I wanted this song to be like a fictional scenario set to music. It wasn't until I had to sit down and finalize the lyrics that I decided the song would be about a strange group or cult at a place called 'O'Connor's Barn' and the words are kind of a re-telling from one friend to another about the ultimate demise of its leader, who fits the typical profile of a charming, sexual, eerily controlling male, as well as a plea for her friend to escape. The female protagonist/narrator has some mixed feelings by the end because she probably really did love him ... just in that special way that one loves a slightly evil, controlling, brilliant, charismatic narcissist.""

5. Eliot St.

""The first version of this song was written while I was still living in Boston and feeling a lot of distance from the city. I was in a relationship that just didn't seem to work out no matter what we did and overall it was just a very isolating time. I recorded an earlier version of the song solo in both Baltimore & Doylestown, Pa. with Natalie Mering (Weyes Blood) on back up vocals. I really wanted to play the song with the band though, so we worked on it in upstate New York. For the chorus I was ruminating on one of the first loves of my life at the time, and thinking a lot about how we 'almost' come so close to things at moments in our lives, yet they still seem so distant. Maybe they aren't.

""Anna wrote a guitar line over the choruses that ended up being one of my favorite touches on the song. In the studio we doubled it with piano. In terms of the production we definitely were interested in going for a lot more of a contemporary approach for the actual sonics as we did with most of the record. Haha ... thinking about it [now], the songs we were listening to in the studio for production inspiration were probably a lot different than what one might think when they hear the final product.""  Shane

6. Hissing My Plea

""The ninth chord which repeats throughout and parts of the verse melody began as a pastoral, slow, fingerpicked folk song I was working on in my mom's kitchen at some point last year. The bridge probably came about around that same time, too. The guitar solo in the middle was its own thing, around which I was trying unsuccessfully to write a whole other song. And the chorus was lifted from another song entirely, that we had to put into another key and simplify to sound good with the verses.

""So when all these scraps were in front of everyone, everything slowly got put together and it became this funk song all of a sudden; it got really filled out with the other instruments and Shane came up with that 'We've got an answer' part. The lyrics began very specifically about this one thing, I was trying to write about this tragic Hollywood/'80s corrupt real estate murder story that I found fascinating (too long to put here), and then chilled out on that premise and just opened it up more broadly to be about desperation in general. I love the string arrangements that Simon [Hanes] did, madly.""  Anna

7. Something There

""I wrote 'Something There' when I was living in Lancaster, Pa. It's a simple song about the concept of, 'you get what you give,' especially in relationships. 'If you are loving, she's loving, if you are leaving, she's leaving,' pretty much sums it up.""  John

8. Padova

""The main chunk of 'Padova' was originally written in this crazy villa-like building we were playing in Padova, Italy. We had some time off after our soundcheck and I just wandered around this huge mansion and found a guitar in this huge wooden room with a chandelier. The guitar was missing a string so I detuned the whole thing to something that sounded alright and the song just plopped out.

""My mother had just passed away earlier that year and I was thinking a lot about death at the time. A few of the songs on the record have some reflections from this period but I feel that this song in particular captures the particular feeling of that time sonically. I made a recording of it in that room and then brought it up when we were in Atlanta. In upstate we added the outro to the song and rounded out all the parts. Mary Lattimore played an amazing harp part on it and [Producer] Jarvis [Taveniere] slid some guitar around. I think the final touch that really wooed me was John's piano playing. I had been thinking a lot about Nina Simone at this time and the way her songs flow with such comforting intensity. I feel like John's piano really has this feeling to it ... It is heartbreaking, strong, and fluid.""  Shane

9. Your Island

""This little ditty was written probably in winter '13. It's about distractions and miscommunication between close associates, and the 'island' as something we build subconsciously, where we hide in our 'towers' to avoid confrontation and truth. Ultimately that s*** always crumbles and you have to face each other and reality, and it's usually the better option, no matter what.""  Anna

10. Own Ways

""'Own Ways' was originally written in [bassist] Keven [Lareau]'s mom's house in New Hampshire. We had a chunk of time where we would go up there a lot to practice. One day John, Keven and I walked downstairs and just started to jam on the riff that ended up being 'Own Ways,' yet it was really slow. While we had some time off between Atlanta and the studio I spent a lot of time listening back to all the songs we had and thought we could use another fast one. So, I made a demo version of it with a lot faster pace and then brought up the idea in the studio.

""This song is really special to me because it is one of those songs where the final arrangement was totally made by the full band in the room. The lyrics, chords, and tone were all set, yet it never had its final form until we were all in the studio. Anna's lead-guitar lines for this song really helped set the mood. Her playing reminds me of the attitude in some Gun Club songs that I love. Kinda sinister and mystic at the same time. In the studio we had our viola player distort and distone as intensely as she could til the end. That's when the song really felt complete; as her strings scraped into a climax at the end. I've been craving more dissonance in our songs and was so happy to have those moments close out the record.""

Jack Garratt has been called the ""sound of the year"" for 2016.

That accolade came from the BBC. In the United Kingdom, he has already won several awards for his music. His debut album, Phase, comes out today in the United States.

From the start of his musical career, Garratt has been a one-man band, playing the guitar, drums and keyboard all himself  often at the same time. Garratt grew up in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, the son of a police officer and a teacher. In 2005, at the age of 13, he entered the Junior Eurovision song contest  and came in dead last.

""That was the first time I ever put my foot in any kind of door,"" he says. ""And the door broke my foot as it slammed in my face.""

A few years later, while till writing and performing music, Garrett took a job as a teaching assistant to a boy with cerebral palsy. The experience, he says, was mind-opening  and had a profound effect on his creative work.

YouTube

""He ended up teaching me a lot about losing your inhibitions when you can, and not being too stuck-up or stubborn to try new things,"" he says. ""I got to see a kid who had cerebral palsy go and hit balls harder and try and run faster than all the other kids in his year, because he wasn't going to let his mind stop him just because his legs were trying to.""

Jack Garratt spoke with NPR's Ari Shapiro about the making of Phase and the personal stories that shaped it.

It's also a deeply cinematic story  in fact, it's currently in development as a miniseries at AMC. And even in its darkest moments, it's a compelling read: The Sparrow follows the crew of a near-future first-contact expedition to an alien planet, alongside the testimony of Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, who is recovering from his part in the ordeal. This isn't just a story about the rigors of space travel and the difficulties of establishing communication after contact. It also explores the way travel forces us to acknowledge what we've left at home, how travel can be an act of faith (regardless of religion), and the ways in which journeys demand internal audits to determine how we've changed in the crossing. (And if you can't get enough of Sandoz, you can follow him in The Sparrow's sequel, Children of God.)

Bill Kurtis reads three quotes from the week's news...Grand Old Chaos, Senior Moment, All The Single Lobsters

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Come join my secret society - the Billuminati. I'm Bill Kurtis.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in downtown Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. We do have a great show for you this week. Later on, we're going to be talking to Mark and Jay Duplass, the writing, directing, acting brothers who are responsible for ""Togetherness"" on HBO, the film ""The One I Love,"" ""The League,"" basically everything ever, they did it. But this weekend is Valentines Day. And we wanted every person out there who somehow didn't get a Valentine from their loved one to know he or she got you this show. That's right - we got a call from him or her and he or she asked us to make this show especially for you to show his or her love.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All we want from you is a sign of affection is that you give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Now, let us welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

MARNIE BABBITT: Hi, this is Marnie Babbitt from Flagstaff, Ariz.

SAGAL: Hey, Marnie Babbitt. How are you?

BABBITT: I'm doing well, thank you, Peter. How are you?

SAGAL: I'm well. I really like your name, Marnie Babbitt. That is a great name. You should be the protagonist of your own television show.

(LAUGHTER)

BABBITT: I think so, too, or maybe my own radio show.

SAGAL: Hey, stay off my turf that, Babbitt.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, welcome to the show, Marnie. Let me introduce you to our panel. First, a comedian performing at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on April 1 and whose book ""I'm Not A Terrorist, But I've Played One On TV"" is now in paperback - it's Maz Jobrani.

(APPLAUSE)

MAZ JOBRANI: Hi Marnie Babbitt.

(APPLAUSE)

JOBRANI: That's tough to say.

SAGAL: Next, a feature writer for the Style section for The Washington Post and a sophisticated woman about town, Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: Hi, Marnie.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And a correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning and the host of ""The Henry Ford's Innovation Nation"" Saturday mornings on CBS, it's Mo Rocca.

(APPLAUSE)

MO ROCCA: Hi, Marnie. I would listen to Marnie Edition.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Marnie, you're going to play Who's Bill This Time? Bill Kurtis is going to read you three quotations from the week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain just two of them, you'll win our prize - the voices scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?

BABBITT: I am so ready.

SAGAL: I can tell. Here is your first quote.

KURTIS: ""Oh wow, wow, wow - wow, so beautiful, so beautiful.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That was somebody beginning his victory speech after winning the Republican New Hampshire primary. Who was it?

BABBITT: Donald Trump.

SAGAL: Yes, indeed. It was Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: We are going to start the show with the Republican primary for the same reason you would start a conversation with the news that the house is on fire.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: In New Hampshire, Donald Trump saw his shadow, and now we have at least eight more weeks of Donald Trump.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And you heard his reaction to his big win - wow, wow, wonderful. It's beautiful. Donald Trump says the things in victory that most people say during a massage.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: The thing I hear most supporters say is they say - they go I love him because he says what's on his mind. He just says what's on his mind, what's on his mind. And then you go well, what about his policies? They go I don't know about his policies. He just says what's on his mind. And I actually encountered it with my Iranian mother. I kid you not; she fell for it. She goes, I like this guy because he says what's on his mind. And I said, mom, if he wins he's anti-immigrant. Your relatives couldn't come to visit you. And she goes, I don't like them anyway.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: So there you go.

ROCCA: I'm happy for - am I jumping the gun here by saying that I read today that Bush's - that Jeb Bush's donors were thrilled that he came in fourth?

SAGAL: That's true, they were.

ROCCA: We're number four.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, no, it's - everybody had written Jeb Bush off. But he actually did better than expected. But more than that, Marco Rubio did worse. He, of course, Saturday night before the primary, he totally flamed out. Chris Christie says, you know, you're acting like a robot. And Rubio's like (imitating robot) that does not compute.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: After, you know, he totally flamed out in New Hampshire, Rubio said - and he said this, this is a quote - ""we've had how many, eight debates, and 7.95 of those debates I did very well on,"" unquote. OK, Mr. Rubio, when people are calling you a robot, it's not a good idea to start spouting numbers down to the second decimal.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, very good, very good. Here is another victory speech from Tuesday night.

KURTIS: ""And you know what that average contribution was? Twenty-seven dollars.""

SAGAL: What a bargain. Who was this big...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: ...Cut-rate winner?

BABBITT: Was it Bernie?

SAGAL: It was Bernie.

KURTIS: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: No last name necessary.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bernie Sanders completely dominated the Democratic primary with the overwhelming support of young people while old people went for Hillary Clinton. This is because unlike old people, young people do not know what old people, like Bernie Sanders, are like.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Do you know what it's like, guys, to watch your grandfather eat? Imagine that running the country.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The State of the Union will be delivered in 15-minute bouts between bathroom breaks, and all of emergency addresses to the nation from the Oval Office will have to be moved before 6:00 p.m.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Think how much could get done if meetings only lasted 15 minutes.

SAGAL: That's true.

ROCCA: Free and sure for all.

SAGAL: Now, since of course as we have already indicated, the winner of the New Hampshire primary inevitably will become the president. Now we have to think about a Sanders administration. It would be very different, of course, Bernie Sanders being Bernie Sanders. Air Force One will just be whatever Southwest Airlines flight happens to be going where he needs to go. Bernie will be like well, they offered me boarding group A, but that's, like, $15 extra.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: Is every state dinner going to be an early-bird special now?

SAGAL: It will be.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But it is crazy what happened in New Hampshire this week. I mean, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. It's like they went to the store during a blizzard and there were only two loaves of bread left.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There was one loaf of bread that was old, white and crusty and another loaf of bread that was completely insane.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: I smell a remake of ""Grumpy Old Men.""

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So whether or not we ever get a female president of the United States, we already have a queen, and here she is.

KURTIS: ""When he loves me good, I take his [expletive] to Red Lobster.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Who says...

ROBERTS: My God.

SAGAL: ...In much more explicit terms in her new song that she'll take you for a nice meal at Red Lobster if you treat her right?

BABBITT: Beyonce.

SAGAL: Beyonce, yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Last week, Queen Bey - Beyonce dropped a new song and video, ""Formation."" And this is true - and just because of that one line, she personally increased sales at Red Lobster restaurants by 30 percent.

JOBRANI: Are you serious?

SAGAL: I'm not - I'm serious. Listen people - the way she said it was first, you get with Beyonce, then you get to go to Red Lobster. It doesn't work in the other direction.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: So it's like Peyton Manning and Budweiser and Beyonce and Red Lobster.

SAGAL: Well, that is really strange because, I mean, you think about it - she just drops Red Lobster in the song, instantly sales go up. She has such power, she could use it for good. It's like when he bleep me good, I take his [expletive] to at the March of Dimes.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: Or how about when he bleeps me good, I give to NPR.

SAGAL: Yeah, that would be nice. Beyonce, if you're listening, we'll take that.

(APPLAUSE)

ROCCA: I think - I think she should have taken him to Olive Garden because when you're there, you're family.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: It would've had a nice ending.

SAGAL: It's true.

JOBRANI: Mo, you know, this discussion was being had - there was a boss at Olive Garden going why couldn't you get us into that song? Just yelling - heads are going to roll. It should've been Olive Garden.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Marnie do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, Marnie is a perfect winter. You get to go to Red Lobster.

(APPLAUSE)

BABBITT: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thank you for playing.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Now Red Lobster sales dip because of that.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""CRAZY IN LOVE"")

BEYONCE: (Singing) Got me looking so crazy right now. Your love's got me looking so crazy right now, got me looking so crazy right now. Your touch got me looking so crazy right now, got me hoping you'll page me right now. Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now, looking so crazy in love, got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.","['past', 'lure', 'travel', 'literary', 'thing', 'cant', 'machine', 'know', 'thats', 'willis', 'change', 'history']"

There have been a couple times in recent weeks when people weve interviewed asked that we remove their names from the stories we posted on the Web. We have issued guidance on this topic several times before. Reminders seem to be in order about how to avoid getting into such situations and how to handle them if they arise.

Click on these headlines to see our guidance:

 This Story About You Is Going To Be On The Web Forever And You May Come To Regret That

 Reminder: Whether To Go With First-Name-Only Needs To Be Discussed And Explained

 How To Explain Why We Wont Take Down A Story

 When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Here are some important points from those notes:

 Were not saying that Sen. Doe or Mayor Smith or CEO Jones need to be reminded that what they say to us is on the record and will be available to anyone with a Web connection. They should know what theyre doing.

 The notes dont cover reporting done in war zones or situations when stopping to have a long conversation about the long tail of the Web isnt safe or practical.

 But the guidance does cover other situations involving people who are vulnerable. Those include survivors of sexual assault, people with serious medical conditions and those whose lives may be put in danger if they are fully identified. As the handbook says, we minimize undue harm and take special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering.

We do not preview our stories for those we interview. But it is essential that vulnerable individuals understand in general how we will be using the information we get from them, how we will identify them and whether any images of them will be published (remember: visuals are important parts of our journalism and we treat them that way). There may be times when people say we can use their full names and photos and we are not comfortable doing so.

It must be made clear to such individuals that our stories do not only air on the radio  they live on various digital forms and will be searchable on the Web.

How such individuals names, biographical details and images will be handled must be discussed with a senior editor well before anything is aired or published. That means a supervising senior editor, a deputy managing editor or the standards & practices editor. In reality, theyll all probably be involved.

One other reminder (because were asked about it at least once a week):

When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source.

Well stop there.

Redundant acronym syndrome isnt our most serious problem. Theres even a case to be made that saying something like START treaty instead of just START (the acronym for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) may be a helpful error on the radio (though never online). If there was a sense that adding the word treaty helped the listener understand what you were talking about, the redundancy would be a relatively minor mistake.

But, listeners notice when we insert redundant words. They point out that we would not say automated teller machine machine or liquid crystal display display or personal identification number number or redundant acronym syndrome syndrome.

For those listeners, redundancies are nicks in otherwise spotless stories. As Oxford Dictionaries notes in its guidance on avoiding redundant expressions, repetition can give the impression that you dont really understand the meaning of the words youre using.

Its also worth noting that we benefit if we eliminate unnecessary words. Doing that makes room for other information and when youre squeezing everything you can into a tight space, each word counts. Precision writing and editing, as weve said before, are important tools of our trade.

There are many lists online of redundancies, including those at:

i toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images

A team of U.S. government disease detectives Monday launched an eagerly anticipated research project in Brazil designed to determine whether the Zika virus is really causing a surge of serious birth defects.

A 16-member team of epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began training dozens of Brazilian counterparts in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, in preparation to begin work on Tuesday. The researchers will gather data on hundreds of Brazilian women and their children.

""Having the data at this point in time are very critically important for understanding the impact Zika might be having in the future and as it spreads in the region,"" says J. Erin Staples, a CDC medical officer leading the CDC team in Brazil.

Scientists believe there has been a significant increase in microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brain, since Zika started spreading widely in Brail. That strongly suggests that the virus is to blame. And Zika has been found in the brains of a small number of babies with microcephaly. But that still does not prove the virus is to blame.

""Taking that and saying the 4,000 to 5,000 cases of microcephaly reported in Brazil are due to Zika is a very big jump,"" Staples says.

To try to better understand whether the association is real, the CDC is launching what is known as a ""case-control"" study, which involves comparing cases of people with diseases with similar people who did not have disease to try to identify the cause.

On Monday, the CDC planned to form eight teams of American and Brazilian investigators. On Tuesday, the teams planned to fan out in the region searching for about 100 mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly since the Zika outbreak began.

The teams will collect blood samples from the mothers and children to test for signs of Zika infection, examine the babies and gather detailed information from the mothers. Among the information the researchers plan to collect is whether the women experienced any symptoms of Zika infection during their pregnancies and, if so, when.

The investigators will also ask the women a series of questions aimed at identifying any other factors that may have played a role in the birth defects, such as whether the women had any other infections, including toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus. In addition, they'll try to determine if the women were exposed to anything in the environment, such as mercury or pesticides, that could be to blame.

The investigators planned to do the same thing with several hundred other women who are similar in terms of their ages, locations and socioeconomic status who gave birth to healthy babies around the same time. The researchers will then compare the two groups.

The hope is that this study will either provide more definitive evidence establishing the link between Zika and microcephaly or identify other factors that may be to blame, either in combination with Zika or instead of Zika.

""What we're really trying to do is to better understand what's going on in terms of the size, the scope and the causes of microcephaly,"" Staples told NPR's Shots blog last week. ""We want to better understand the role the Zika virus has in the outbreak of microcephaly.""

Staples estimated it would take three or four weeks to collect all the data, but was unsure how long the analysis would take.

But ""hopefully from all this work we will glean some information that we'll be able to help us prevent other children from being born microcephaly,"" Staples says.

The virus is spreading rapidly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Dozens of travelers have arrived in the United States after being infected elsewhere, but so far the virus is only known to have spread once in the continental United States, and that was through sexual contact.

The mosquito that spreads the virus is found in parts of the United States, but health authorities have said they are optimistic any transmission in this country would be quickly controlled.","['brazil', 'arrives', 'staples', 'cdc', 'birth', 'investigate', 'possible', 'virus', 'united', 'link', 'babies', 'microcephaly', 'women', 'zika']"

At pretty much any Lady Gaga performance, you can count on spectacle: whirling lights, elaborate sets and many, many costume changes. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different  except that she was deploying her famous pipes in the service of another artist's music. As she pinballed through David Bowie's catalog in a career-spanning tribute to the late icon, it was a reminder that the 29-year-old Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her hero. After six Grammys of her own, a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel, duets with Tony Bennett, a Super Bowl national anthem and one very famous meat dress, there appears to be little that the woman born Stefani Germanotta cannot do.

And yet, she recently surprised herself. Alongside veteran hitmaker Diane Warren, Gaga co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the 2015 film The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses. The track is up for an Oscar, but the bigger breakthrough is a personal one. Like Warren, Gaga is a survivor of sexual assault, and says the decision to work on the song didn't come easily  but that once it was out there, stories from other survivors came flooding in, some prefaced with the admission that they'd never felt comfortable sharing their experiences until now.

Lady Gaga joined NPR's Michel Martin from New York to talk about songwriting that hits close to home, how artists and fans benefit from mutual support, and what David Bowie meant to her as a teenager gazing on the cover of Aladdin Sane for the first time. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below.

Michel Martin: I want to start off by talking about ""Til It Happens to You,"" which is nominated for an Oscar. I know it's not easy to talk about, but may I ask how you came to be involved in this project?

Lady Gaga: ""Til It Happens to You"" is something that has come out of a group of women coming together, who decided that they wanted to make a change. And that's me and Diane Warren and Bonnie [Greenberg], who was the music supervisor. When we first started talking, I was really not sure what to do. I have a very uncomfortable relationship with this topic because it's so personal to me, and I didn't know if I was ready to be a part of it. And as soon as I met Diane and she started to talk to me about what she wanted to do, I knew that I had to be brave, and I had to help tell this story to the world.

So, Diane and I met in New York City. She played me this song idea that she had started, and I immediately started crying. I was really unsure, even in that moment, if I was going to be able to do it. And she said, ""Well, I want you to make it your own. I want it to be something that you feel connected to."" And we started to change the song together  make it something that reflected both of our experiences with sexual assault. I guess it's a long story, but what I'm trying to say is that it's a quite complicated one. And it starts with me, when I was a young girl: I had this traumatic experience, and it's sort of coming full circle now, and really ending in a way for me, as I'm healing from it in writing this song with Diane.

Have other artists come to you since you recorded this song to talk about this issue? It just seems as though a number of people in your industry have had similar experiences and didn't talk about it for years, or ever.

Yeah, there are. I wouldn't reveal names of anyone that came to me personally to express that they had been through something similar. But there's a lot of people, men and women all over the world, who have experienced sexual assault not only on campuses and not only in the music industry, but within their own families and within their own relationships. It has been kind of overwhelming for both Diane and I, the amount of letters and people on the street that stop us to talk about this song and to tell us how much it means to them. I've had reporters tell me about their experiences with sexual assault in interviews, and they've told me, ""I've never ever told anyone that but you."" You know, that's a powerful thing to witness.

As an artist, and also through your foundation, you've worked on some really raw and emotionally complex issues. Given that you have a voice you can use to elevate a topic, how do you decide what you want to talk about?

Well, I always have been an activist for things that were just authentically a part of my life, that I felt connected to. In terms of my involvement in ""don't ask, don't tell"" and marriage equality and anti-bullying and social emotional learning in schools  these are all things that arise out of my relationship with the world and with my fans. I listen to them, I meet with them, they write me letters; I'm in tune with what people want to change in the world, and I want to be a part of moving that forward. I just genuinely feel that that's what you do when you're an artist: You stick up for the people around you.

I imagine that's draining, emotionally and physically. How do you manage that work and still do all the other things you do?

I guess I don't really think about it that way, you know? This thing that I do with caring about the message in my music, it's not separate from my work as a commercial artist; they're totally one and the same. I'm always going to be thinking about what my voice means. When I was 22, putting out my first couple records, I was a baby  and nobody really views you as any type of role model or anything. But as you get older, you realize that you have the attention of a lot of young people. And you think, ""OK, well, what should I say now? What can I say that will be impactful in a positive way?""

You know, just bringing it back to ""Til It Happens To You"": What happened to me happened 10 years ago. And then I became famous like overnight, it felt like, and I never really had time to deal with my issues. As soon as you start to make money selling your music, there's a lot of people around you that are very excited about what you have to offer financially to business, and they start to maybe forget that there's a person underneath all of that. [So] my team now, they spend every day making sure that I am healthy and happy and that I am able to focus on the things that I love.

We have to talk about David Bowie and your tribute to him at the Grammys this year. He's somebody you've been compared to in some ways: constantly reimagining yourself, testing the boundaries of presentation. Your performance actually used computer graphics to draw his famous lightning bolt on your face as you sang. How did you get to this point?

YouTube

Well, the moment that I saw the Aladdin Sane cover for the first time, I was 19 years old, and it just changed my perspective on everything, forever. It was an image that changed my life. I remember I took the vinyl record out of the casing and I put it on my vinyl player  which was on my stovetop in my kitchen, because I was living in this really tiny apartment and I had my turntable on my stove. ""Watch That Man"" came on and, I mean, that was just the beginning of my artistic birth. I started to dress more expressively. I started to go to the library and look through more art books. I took an art history class. I was playing with a band.

I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, my friends and I in New York, we've lived a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology since we were kids  and this is because of him. I just would never be here, or have the philosophy that I have, if I didn't have someone to look up to that you know blew my mind so intensely. You know the way that Nile Rodgers talks about Coltrane, and the way that Coltrane makes him think about jazz? That's how David Bowie is for me. You meet or see a musician that has something that is of another planet, of another time, and it changes you forever. I believe everyone has that, don't you? That one thing you saw as a kid that made you go, ""Oh, okay. Now I know who I am.""

How do you feel now that the tribute is over? I mean, it had to come together so quickly, and it was so complex and had so many layers to it.

How do I feel now that it's over? I mean, I feel like my whole career is a tribute to David Bowie.

So it's not! It's ongoing, right?

It's still going. I've been watching his videos all day long, and also listening to Blackstar, his last album, which is a truly incredible piece of music. It's one of the single greatest things an artist has ever done: making a masterpiece album that is their own eulogy. Can you imagine? To go into the studio every day and put your heart in that place, where you are saying goodbye to life? I mean, his art made him strong.","['brave', 'bowie', 'started', 'things', 'song', 'david', 'gaga', 'know', 'music', 'thats', 'lady', 'talk', 'really']"
npr,2016-02-20 00:00:00,How Brainwaves Allow Paralyzed Musicians To Continue Playing,[],"How Brainwaves Allow Paralyzed Musicians To Continue Playing

Linda Wertheimer speaks with Eduardo Miranda and Elisa Bergersen about their project that enables paralyzed musicians to perform again through proxies.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

At the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in London last year, a quartet of musicians made music again. One was a violinist, severely disabled in a car accident; another had a degenerative disease. None of them had enough control of their bodies to hold an instrument or even to speak. They wore caps, which read their brains' electrical impulses. Alongside them, four proxy musicians translated those impulses into an ever-changing melody. We gathered Eduardo Miranda and Elisa Bergersen to talk about the project. He harnessed the technology and she served as a proxy, playing the viola. I asked her exactly how - I asked exactly how everything worked.

EDUARDO MIRANDA: We developed an interface that if someone wants to select, let's say, a melody that sounds, you know, is low or fast or whatever, then that person looks and then that choice is made.

WERTHEIMER: What you appear to have done is you have discovered a way for them to choose a musical phrase from a choice of about four different ones. As I understand it, they are not imagining music in their minds.

MIRANDA: No.

WERTHEIMER: They are choosing a piece of music.

MIRANDA: They are choosing - exactly. They choose what they see in front of them. Of course, because they are musicians and they have been - you know, some of them more professional than others - but they understand what they see because we provide little musical scores for them. So the choices they make are informed choices. They know what those things are going to sound like.

WERTHEIMER: Now, Ms. Bergersen, you carry out the instruction that is sent to you by the computer through this complicated process of electronic signals.

ELISA BERGERSEN: Yep, that's right.

WERTHEIMER: Now, how does - what is the experience like?

BERGERSEN: Well, each member of the quartet is paired up with a partner, and the four partners are the four patients. So what I see is what I'm being fed, obviously, by my musical partner. So the experience is very different from playing, let's say, a written score on a piece of paper as you would do normally because you never know what you're going to get. We did know the excerpts of music or the phrases of music that Eduardo had already composed previously. But we didn't know in which order we were going to get them or how many times we were going to get one of them.

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) So you're sort of doing a very fast sight-read of something that you've see before but you have no idea what it's going to sound like in combination with the other parts.

BERGERSEN: That's right, yeah. And an actual fact - it's a more intense sight-read than normal because even if you're sight-reading a piece of music, you normally have 40 or 60 or 80 bars on one sheet. And even if you've only seen that sheet for two seconds, you can flick your eyes down the page and you can see how intense the music gets or parts where you may be resting. You know, you can get an idea of the piece even just by casting your eyes down the sheets whereas with this you can only see, let's say, two or four bars at a time, and you know nothing after that point.

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) So if I were standing there with the doctors and nurses in the back rows, I suppose, I would have seen four people with instruments and four people wearing funny hats and looking at computers.

BERGERSEN: Yes, correct.

WERTHEIMER: How did the audience respond to that?

BERGERSEN: It was really emotional. It was really emotional because, as Eduardo said, you know, these four patients, they do have a musical background. They were all musically interested or experienced in some way. So for the audience to see them being able to perform, as it were, it was really moving. It was really - it was really emotional and there were a few tears (laughter) that I witnessed.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

WERTHEIMER: Now, Dr. Miranda, you - you wrote the piece of music.

MIRANDA: Yes, I did. Yeah, it's a...

WERTHEIMER: When I mean you wrote, you wrote the original combination of phrases. right?

MIRANDA: It's like a Rubik's cube, you know...

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter).

MIRANDA: ...The way I designed it. I composed hundreds of those small phrases, and I laid a kind of a scaffold where those musical phrases would fall and then for each of those little beams, so to speak, in the scaffold, there were several options. So I more or less know what's going to happen, but this piece has millions of combinations, so it will always sound different.

WERTHEIMER: Have they surprised you, your disabled musicians? Have they surprised you with what they do with the bits that you gave them?

MIRANDA: Yes, they did. I think the thing that surprised me most is how quick they got to the idea. You know, I was thinking, oh, no, I'll have to explain this many times and I have to rehearse, I have to practice and so on and so on. It was nothing like that.

We just got in. We just put the system in front of them and they already started doing it. Somehow, we enabled them to communicate emotions within themselves, and I think that was what moved us, Elisa was saying. You know, we were all moved when we saw this happening 'cause it was really magical.

WERTHEIMER: Professor Eduardo Miranda of Plymouth University in the U.K. and Elisa Bergersen of the Bergersen Quartet, thank you both.

BERGERSEN: Thank you.

MIRANDA: Thank you.

Political blogger Dru Ealons, Virginia Republican Puneet Ahluwalia, and publisher of The Federalist webmagazine Ben Domenech join Michel Martin to discuss the criticism surrounding President Obama's decision to skip Justice Antonin Scalia's funeral and the republican primary in South Carolina.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now it's time for the Barbershop. That's our weekly conversation with a group of interesting folks to talk about what's in the news and what's on our minds. Sitting in the seats for a shapeup this weekend are Barbershop regular Dru Ealons. Dru's a political blogger and former Obama appointee at the Environmental Protection Agency. Welcome back, nice to see you.

DRU EALONS: Glad to be back.

MARTIN: Welcome back also to Puneet Ahluwalia. He is active in the local Republican Party in Northern Virginia. He's also a consultant. Welcome back to you, Puneet.

PUNEET AHLUWALIA: Thank you so much for having me.

MARTIN: Joining us for the first time is Ben Domenech. He is the publisher of the conservative web magazine The Federalist and hosts The Federalist Radio Hour. Ben...

BEN DOMENECH: Good to be with you.

MARTIN: Good to see you, too. And thank you for having that great voice, that great, like, Darth Vader voice.

DOMENECH: Thank you so much.

MARTIN: I just love that. And also here to Domenico Montanaro. He's our lead political editor for NPR. Welcome - and I also understand that you have some news for us.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: I do. Well, the Associated Press is projecting that Hillary Clinton has won the Nevada Democratic caucuses. With more than two-thirds of the vote in now, Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders 52 to 48 - most of the vote that's out still remaining in Clark County, where about two-thirds of the vote in Democratic caucuses comes from. That's where Las Vegas is.

MARTIN: All right, so Domenico, thanks. That's Domenico Montanaro. He's going to stick with us for the rest of our conversation, right?

MONTANARO: All right, sure.

MARTIN: You have nowhere else to go, do you?

MONTANARO: Oh, you know, I'm just hanging out with...

MARTIN: Exactly.

MONTANARO: ...Twenty feet outside the studio anyway. So...

MARTIN: That's exactly it, so thank you for taking a walk down the hall to talk with us about this. OK, what we'd like to start with is we just heard our colleague Nina Totenberg reporting on the funeral of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. And I've got to start us off by asking about criticism of the president for not attending the funeral mass, which was held at the National Shrine at the Immaculate Conception. Now, the president did visit the Supreme Court yesterday, where the justice was lying reposed. And the vice president, Joe Biden, who also shares Justice Scalia's Catholic faith, did attend the mass with his wife Jill, which was celebrated by the justice's son Paul, who's a priest, a very moving ceremony. But a lot of people are jumping all over the president for not attending. And I just wanted to - for a number of reasons. Some people saying that it was just rude, and other people saying he missed a chance to demonstrate bipartisanship. So Ben, I just wanted to ask each of you what you think about that.

DOMENECH: So I think this is kind of a fitting coda for a presidency that began with a lot of promise to maybe make D.C. a more civil place, a place of more bipartisanship. And I think that this really is something that even people on the left - even my friends on the left criticized as being something that was inappropriate. President Bush, obviously attended and eulogized William Rehnquist when he died back in 2005. It's not like the situation security wise is any worse now comparable to then. And I think that, you know, Justice Scalia, during his life he had all sorts of different lines. But one of his lines that he came back to frequently was that he believed he was in a battle about ideas and not about people, that good people could have bad ideas and that they should be able to get past that. It explains his friendship with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others across the aisle who shared none of his opinions really when it came to the law. And I think it would've been a good demonstration of bipartisanship for the president to show.

MARTIN: Dru, do we know whether the justice's family actually even wanted the president there?

EALONS: Well...

MARTIN: Not to be mean about it, but perhaps, you know, this is a solemn religious rite. Did they...

EALONS: Right.

MARTIN: ...Even want him there? Do we know?

EALONS: I was just thinking about that. Yes, he could have gone and yes, he could have shown bipartisanship. And I think - or ease the political banker - rancor that is out there. But I think, you know, a lot of times that needs to be a two-way street. And this is a way that unfortunately gave those who look for opportunity to criticize to criticize. However, when you think about the reverence and what happens and takes place at a funeral that case, if it were my family and how they do, they don't even have a eulogy. And they - it's a very sacred type of event. And to have the president there could have been disruptive. And yes...

MARTIN: But wait - but he's - the president's been to a number of funerals of people.

EALONS: Right.

MARTIN: I mean, you know...

EALONS: But...

MARTIN: Senator - State Sen. Pinckney in South Carolina...

EALONS: Exactly...

MARTIN: ...After that terrible shooting in Charleston, S.C.

EALONS: ...But those funerals were highly televised and were pushed before...

MARTIN: This was televised.

EALONS: But pushed for a public type of event. And he actually gave the eulogy. And I guess my point was that

MARTIN: This was televised, Dru. I watched it.

EALONS: I get that. I get it was televised. But I'm thinking more along the lines of he could've gone, yes.

MARTIN: Should he have gone? I'm asking you. Should he have gone...

EALONS: Should he have gone?

MARTIN: ...In your opinion?

EALONS: I would just say I am glad that he paid respects. I don't think he had to go. I think that's my point. I don't think he had to go.

MARTIN: OK, Puneet, what about you?

AHLUWALIA: He had to go. You have a justice who's in office who passed away, and President Obama there's no red America, there's no blue America. There's one America. Where is it? This was the time to show respect, and I think...

MARTIN: You don't think he showed respect by going to the Supreme Court?

AHLUWALIA: Well, that's one thing, but apparently I think when you - in certain cultures, especially in the Catholic you say goodbye. And he should have shown as a commander-in-chief - paid his respect and been there. That's how I look at it.

DOMENECH: Chris Hayes from MSNBC said the other day that his mother always told him that if you're thinking about whether you should go to a funeral or not, you should go.

AHLUWALIA: Exactly.

DOMENECH: I think that's generally good advice.

MARTIN: All right, Domenico, I'm not going to ask you for an opinion on this because that's not - that's not your job. But I am going to move us along to the whole question of the South Carolina primary, if that's OK with you.

MONTANARO: Sure.

MARTIN: OK, so tonight's primary's in South Carolina. Donald Trump could cement himself as the frontrunner as we edge closer to Super Tuesday. But he continues to say things that we just have not heard from other candidates. Earlier this week, he hit back at Pope Francis after the Pope in Mexico remarked that people who want to build walls aren't Christian. Most people assumed that that was aimed at Donald Trump. And then last night, you just heard from our colleague Don Gonyea that he was talking about tougher tactics against terrorism by repeating a story that fact checkers say is not true about Gen. John Pershing allegedly executing Muslims with bullets that were tainted with pig's blood, which is clearly meant as a religious insult. And I just - you know, I have to say - you know, we keep saying that, you know, he can say things that other people can't say. It doesn't have any real meaning, but I still have to ask you about this. You know, what do you think?

MONTANARO: None of those things matter in a Republican primary, I have to tell you. I mean, I think that the thing that mattered - that might matter for Donald Trump and whether or not his numbers come down is the fact that on Thursday, he had echoed support for - voice support for the employer mandate in the health care law, Obamacare, and then kind of had to walk that back, his uneven performance at the debate in which he criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq War - and not only for criticizing the decision to go in but saying that he lied about weapons of mass destruction, knowing that they weren't there. Those things started to raise questions for conservatives in South Carolina. And also, it didn't look like he was in command. He wasn't in control, and I think when people start to look at that funnel and start to winnow out the field and figure out who do they want to be in the White House, I think a lot of conservatives were saying eh, you know, is this the guy who I want to pick? I think we'll see - he's had a double-digit lead for quite some time there in South Carolina. But there have been some polls in the last week or so that have showed that race tightening. It will be really great to watch what happens tonight when people actually vote.

MARTIN: Puneet, what do you think about this? Is this a candidate that you can go out and sell to your constituency...

AHLUWALIA: I think he is sellable.

MARTIN: ...To your fellow man?

AHLUWALIA: The reason is if he's leading in the polls, the very reason is that he is basically watching certain frustration and pent up emotion that exists, hence the reason he's leading the polls. And - but at the same time, he's also in a very divided field where it's basically - people are choosing their own special candidates they are in for. So he is vocalizing issues which are important. And as a person who's running for himself in the 10 District as a candidate, I will support any Republican nominee.

MARTIN: OK. OK, Ben, what about you? What do you think?

DOMENECH: So I think this is another example of Donald Trump being, you know, an Internet comment thread come to life, which is the way that he expresses himself oratorically. I do think that there was interesting point though regarding that the policy shift. One of the reasons he has enjoyed this support is that so many people who are backing him are not actually that ideological. They are moderate. They are disaffected voters who haven't been very active in politics before. But he has also glommed on a lot of new support in South Carolina from evangelicals, from conservatives, which were not the traditional people who had been backing him to that point. So it's potentially - something like endorsing the mandate does potentially hurt him with people like that. But then there's a question of how outraged are they? And I think that in this case, we're dealing with a state that while it traditionally has not looked to candidates like that to back, it's been refined, let's say, in the types of people it elects. It's elected people who look like kind of the dream team for the new Republican Party in Nikki Haley and Tim Scott and people like that. I think that in this case, you have an example of a state where the outrage may be so significant that they still give him a big victory tonight. And that's going to give him huge momentum going into the SEC primary.

MARTIN: What do you think? Can I ask you what you think about it? What do you think about what he said?

DOMENECH: I think that this is just par for the course for Donald Trump. Everything that Trump says has to be viewed as within the context of negotiation. He negotiates from the extremes. And frankly, it works along the lines of people who endorse a conspiracy theory where anybody who comes along who judges the theory as being incorrect is just more evidence that the conspiracy exists against him from the establishment, from the elites. I participated in the National Review cover story against Trump. Obviously, I was one of those 22 people. And so I think my stance on him is pretty clear. But I think that he's going to continue to thrive and succeed in an environment where there's so much outrage.

MARTIN: All right, Dru, what do you think?

EALONS: I think it doesn't matter what he says. I think he's turned the whole political system on its back. I believe that his bombastic reality and how he responds to things is what we come to respect and know, and I don't think it matters to this particular electorate. Those that are supporting him, like Ben said, the ideals about pro-choice, abortion rights, all of that is not necessarily concerned. What they feel is they've been disaffected because they haven't been heard. For those who have been establishment, who have been elected, who have been there, they have not done anything. You keep saying you're going to repeal Obamacare. It hasn't happened. You keep saying you're going to do this or that and it hasn't happened, so now they believe that because of who Trump is that he can actually make that happen.

MARTIN: OK, let's - before we let you all go, I want to touch on an interesting meeting between Ted Cruz and Ben Carson that occurred Thursday night. The meeting was reportedly an attempt by Cruz to mend fences between the two after, you know, some kind of dirty tricks, I think it's fair to say. And it's become a little bit of a thing on social media because of the venue where it took place, which was a closet.

(SOUNDBITE OF RAP OPERA, ""TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET CHAPTER 1"")

ROBERT KELLY: He walks up to the closet. He closer to the closet. Now he's at the closet. Now he's opening the closet...

MARTIN: Sometimes you just have to do it. You just have to play the - I mean...

EALONS: Oh, my God.

MARTIN: Sometimes you just have to bring it out because it occurred to you, so you - OK, so it didn't end particularly well because the Carson campaign came out afterwards saying that they thought the meeting was going to be off the record and that the details were leaked and they didn't appreciate that. So I mean, you know, you've all - well, a lot of you have worked on campaigns. You've followed campaigns, certainly. I don't know, I didn't find it that strange that they met in a closet.

AHLUWALIA: Yeah.

MARTIN: Did you? Did anybody?

EALONS: No.

MONTANARO: I thought it was weird. I don't know. They...

MARTIN: You did?

MONTANARO: I mean, maybe it was a really big closet. But I mean, they said that Secret Service were outside the - I don't know that I remember a meeting like that. I mean, maybe some of the others on the panel have met in closets with some of their cohorts before. I don't know.

MARTIN: Was it - why is this a thing? Why is this a thing, Ben?

DOMENECH: You know, isn't this kind of an example, though, where - I mean, you've - you're familiar enough with this to know it's very difficult to get privacy on the campaign...

MARTIN: Right...

DOMENECH: ...Trail.

MARTIN: ...Thank you. That's what I was saying.

DOMENECH: And so I think that if this is something like that, I can understand why people would laugh about it. Cruz himself though does have a problem with Carson. As long as Carson is in the race, he siphons away evangelical support. He may perform poorly in South Carolina but still stay in simply to kind of spite Cruz and everybody else in this situation where he feels that he's been treated unfairly.

MARTIN: Do you really think that's why Dr. Carson's staying in at this point, just to spite him?

DOMENECH: No, I think there really was signs that that campaign was getting ready to fold. And then after some of these things happened, I think that he's kind of staying in there - perhaps not out of spite but more directly just that he feels like he wants to reestablish himself...

EALONS: (Whispers) It's the ego.

DOMENECH: ...as a serious candidate - yeah, the ego...

EALONS: It's the ego.

AHLUWALIA: I don't think it's the ego.

MARTIN: You don't think so, Puneet?

AHLUWALIA: I don't think - what I've seen of an intellectual doctor who is - who has a very - in his mind - a very clear way of leading America. I think he's staying there for a purpose. I think he...

MARTIN: Which is what?

EALONS: I'm not saying the ego is about the purpose. I'm saying the ego is for him to say you're going to get out or leap that he's going to be out, that his ego is saying no, I'm not because I do have a purpose. I do have something that America needs to see. That was my point of the purpose.

MARTIN: But do you think the closet meeting was - what, Dru? - you were cracking up. Just admit it, you were cracking up. Tell me why.

EALONS: I think it was unfortunate because they would take oppor - because it's going to go viral like this. But to your point, there's no place that you can be private. I just think maybe it could've been orchestrated a little bit better. But if anybody walks by and sees two Secret Service people standing outside a closet, it's still going to be a little weird. And the fact that things, they...

MARTIN: Where could they have met, at Denny's? I don't - where are you supposed to meet, like the kitchen at the Denny's?

EALONS: But the funny thing about it is, is that...

MARTIN: IHOP is good.

EALONS: ...He came out still mad. Like, he's still upset about it. Like, whatever happened in the closet, it didn't resolve anything

MARTIN: It doesn't work, didn't work.

AHLUWALIA: I think it didn't achieve the purpose what...

MARTIN: Right.

AHLUWALIA: ...Cruz had in mind and what Ben Carson had in mind. But I think it's a good - it could be a good movie in making in the future.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: OK, all right...

MONTANARO: Even though they have Vegas on Tuesday, what happened in the closet - well, never mind.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: Oh, wow.

EALONS: Wow.

MARTIN: Thank you, Domenico. All right, we have to leave it there for now. That was political blogger Dru Ealons, The Federalist's Ben Domenech, Virginia Republican activist Puneet Ahluwalia and our own political - lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thank you so much for speaking with us, all.

MONTANARO: Thank you.

DOMENECH: Thank you for having us.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

The low rumble of Beyonce built like thunder, starting on the first Thursday of February, as the #BEYONCEISCOMING hashtag began trending on Twitter. Rumor spread that not only was the reigning Queen of Pop about to unleash a Super Bowl performance that would render headliner Coldplay a sideshow, but the Internet had gotten wind that there was new music afoot, too.

Beyonce's digital drop famously stopped the world the last time around, a little over two years ago, and by now, for music fans all over, just the threat of new Beyonce music is enough to throw a wrench in one's day. In New Orleans, though, she looms even a little bit larger. Here she exists as a specter whose presence you might already be living with. Ever since she shot the ""Deja Vu"" video at a bar in Carrollton and a plantation in St. James Parish the summer of 2006, Beyonce sightings have increased in New Orleans to the point where today they are both rampant and unverifiable. Solange is the visible Knowles sister, the one who lives here fulltime, and she was especially about it this Mardi Gras. She lead the Krewe of Muses parade, drunkenly accepted the key to the city from the mayor and lost her wedding ring throwing beads from her float before appearing at the Zulu Ball and hosting her own Lil Kim themed party. She is constantly and colorfully present.

Beyonce is more elusive. Her immense celebrity should make moving freely an impossibility and give her invitation to fancier forays than our chaotic goodtiming. So rumored glimpses, whether it's because of her secured privacy or our own (self-)doubt, inevitably become ""why you lyin'?"" moments. That's Bey and Jay Z's new house, I'm telling you. Someone's cousin once danced with her at DJ Soul Sister's Sunday night party, either this year or last. If she's in town she ""always"" ends her nights with a hot sausage poboy at Gene's. Sure.

So when ""Formation"" struck, its decidedly New Orleans aesthetic  images of Mardi Gras Indians and lace-drenched ladies in Creole cottages, the voices of bounce artists Messy Mya and Big Freedia, stunning performance footage atop a sinking NOPD car  seemed a confirmation of all that time, indeed, spent with us. The world looked to Beyonce with rapt attention and in a halted moment she served everybody the sights and sounds of black New Orleans. All this, just as we readied to celebrate the final, most intense weekend of Mardi Gras.

For her first single from what we expect will be her next album, Beyonce glorified the black New Orleans culture that is both hyper familiar to me, having grown up in the city, and dramatically invisible in the national media. We are represented by 12 Years a Slave and Annie, the Popeyes Chicken Queen, and whatever the words ""Bourbon Street"" or ""voodoo queen"" conjure up, but rarely by movie characters with the sturdy grace of the little old Creole ladies who every Sunday attend Corpus Christi Catholic Church in the Seventh Ward or the brash confidence of the second liners who've been buckjumping since the 1800s. Beyonce saw us and declared us good.

Her representation has been lauded for being ""unapologetically black,"" an embrace of all the things that pop culture either whitewashes for profit or disregards entirely. So it's either incredibly savvy or completely ironic that Beyonce chose New Orleans as the backdrop for the assertive blackness of ""Formation."" There is perhaps no city in America where being black has historically been defined, by law and by social custom, in so many different ways. Blackness here has been measured in drops and fractions, measured against paper bags and disguised with French and Spanish terminology, divided into backatown and Uptown neighborhoods and left to drown as a community. Blackness, here more than anywhere, is complicated, and Beyonce's experience of it may be unapologetic, but New Orleanians at Mardi Gras time didn't exactly agree that it was theirs.

From Friday until Fat Tuesday, the biggest, brightest parades rolled day and night throughout the city. In between the dozens of papier mache floats depicting Roman and Egyptian gods and Greek muses, mostly black high school bands, cheerleaders, dance teams, flag and baton twirlers marched in tight formation, executing songs and routines that had been polished to dazzle weeks before. The weekend parades, particularly the superkrewes that parade at night, count as prime time; inclusion in them is an honorific reserved for the schools that really get down, whose basslines and high-stepping is never not on point. Except this year, when, mid-eight-count, someone from the crowd yelled ""You came to slay!"" a sparkling majorette broke her gameface and threw a laugh of recognition in that direction, just this once.

Post-Katrina, those band numbers had dwindled, along with school enrollments, because of displacement and dysfunction. Some schools shut down, some merged with rivals, some charters opened. Six months after the storm, a sadder, smaller Mardi Gras rolled, and in the years since high school bands have swelled again. How strong, how deep is your band  this is a point of pride and argument. Small bands who spread themselves wide over the pavement have weak sound and do less elaborate arrangements. 10 years later, bands' formations don't just fill up a single car lane in the streets where they parade, they stretch once again from curb to curb blaring heart-poundingly soulful versions of The Weeknd's ""The Hills.""

Beyonce's ""Formation"" video featured the four drum majors from Edna Karr High School, one of the city's most popular marching bands, via a clip from the documentary That B.E.A.T. ""We were wowed,"" Karr's principal, Harold Clay, told Nola.com. ""I always have to take into account the exposure and what it entails for the kids, but to have a world renowned superstar wanting and really investigating what band she really wants in a video  a lot of people didn't make the cut.""

Footage from That B.E.A.T. is the only part of ""Formation"" that was shot in New Orleans, with the rest filmed in California. That here-but-not-here trickery has given credence to criticism that Beyonce has once again swagger jacked a New Orleans culture she does not truly belong to. ""First it was 'Get Me Bodied' and taking from Jubilee [Beyonce's 2006 song has an extended dance callout section at its end which owes a debt to local bounce artist DJ Jubilee's ""Get It Ready"" and ""Do the Jubilee""], now she's got Messy Mya and Freedia on there and trying to steal from sissy bounce,"" one Lundi Gras revealer argued near the line to buy soft shell crab poboys. Another man, folding up his lawn chair at the riverfront festival, had his own ax to grind: ""Maybe she can tell us why it took so long to send help [during Katrina].""

A huge part of Beyonce's rise to pop superstardom has been her extraordinary use of videos, which are as iconic for their culture-defining dance moves (""Single Ladies"") as for their timing. Beyonce synthesizes visual cues and themes from all over the place (and history) to create for a medium that has to both promote and embody her music. Such is her confidence in their effect, she has stopped giving traditional interviews, and her art, in this case punctuated by her flipping both middle fingers while standing between the columns of an ivied mansion, is her sole response to its critics.

The double-fisted salute may be necessary for a global star who makes no bones about grounding her art in her black American experience, an intersection where Afros and Givenchy dresses and ""Jackson 5 nostrils"" are all touchstones of glamour. It might also have been a proactive dismissal of protests she surely knew her nod to the Black Lives Matter movement would induce. But to be unapologetic for, and quiet in conversation of, her ""Formation"" video is to also leave open to interpretation the image of her sinking into floodwaters on the hood of an NOPD cop car, a scene shot on a soundstage in Los Angeles. Was she making reference to heinous policing tactics in the aftermath of Katrina, offering that what happened to all those black bodies then could well have happened to Beyonce too? Was she sinking or was she submerging herself?

""I did initially think it [the flood metaphor] was awkward, but I gave it a pass because of the cop car. I assumed it had more to do with a stance on Black Lives Matter than Katrina,"" says New Orleans-born filmmaker and video director Chike Ozah. ""I always like anything that is going to keep New Orleans in the conversation.""

""I stopped the video halfway through,"" says New Orleans native Shantrelle Lewis. ""Not for any one particular reason, but because it was too much."" Lewis, a curator and filmmaker, lost both her great-grandmother and grandmother in 2005 due to Katrina-related circumstances. ""This is only one of millions of stories of other people who are triggered by those very visceral images of those flood waters. I was flabbergasted.""

""Then everybody started to claim what the imagery meant, they're trying to bring in vodou and African sacred traditions into it, she's representing the south, or it's just this unapologetically black anthem,"" she says. ""I'm like, 'What about New Orleans, though?' There are so many things that are wrong with this video that, if you're from New Orleans, you cannot deny, starting with the colorism that is vivid in the video.""

Given longstanding tensions between light-skinned New Orleans blacks who identify as Creole and the black populace who roll their eyes at that qualifier, the lyric ""you mix that Negro with that Creole make a Texas bama"" rings differently in attuned ears than it does elsewhere. Combined with scenes of Bey in colonial era wardrobe and the fact that 10 years ago she scrapped a B'Day b-side called ""Creole,"" which called women to the dance floor by skin tone, ""Formation"" lands Beyonce squarely in the middle of a centuries-old sensitivity to the term. For many, the word Creole automatically calls to mind a separatist history dating back to the 1700s system of placage, a social distinction given to the free black consorts of colonialists, and will always serve as a reminder of our city's purposeful embrace of one type of blackness over another. Was she acknowledging that part of our black history or fetishizing it?

Beyonce's New Orleans as depicted in ""Formation"" and the New Orleans that Mardi Gras stirs to life overlap and refute each other and mix in a way that IRL New Orleanians can hate and love all at once and be just fine with the contradiction. Last Sunday, as the Krewe of Thoth rolled along the live oak-lined streets of Uptown, parade goers staked out spots that would allow for a quick withdrawal to watch Super Bowl 50 before a return to the streets for the Bacchus mega-parade. There was urgency in all kinds of New Orleanians, since local-born football scion Peyton Manning was taking on Cam Newton's Carolina Panthers and Beyonce's impending performance had everyone wondering whether her new spectacle would include us, too. Southern University's band didn't march in Endymion on Saturday, is it because they were going to join her? Would Beyonce bring out Big Freedia? Would she do something totally new and maybe perform the other song whose video she maybe shot in the Superdome?

Leaving Thoth with my two brothers and two sisters, we jammed into Milan Lounge, a dive bar 15 blocks from the private high school Manning attended and seven blocks from the bar where Big Freedia would be performing postgame, as she had just deflatingly announced on Instagram. The almost entirely white crowd there smoked Pall Mall Slims outside and poured shots inside, while our all-black crew of five spent the first half watching the Panthers fall behind Manning's Broncos. As Saints fans, we're constitutionally incapable of rooting for NFC South rivals, but the coded analysis of Cam Newton's leadership (""too arrogant""), dancing (""not sportsmanlike"") and intelligence (""he can't read a defense, that's why he runs"") in the lead up to kick off was too racist to leave us ambivalent. Every time Newton rolled out from the pocket, one guy standing at the bar's elbow yelled ""KILL HIM"" in a guttural cry that made everyone near him hoot and each of our party wonder exactly how long we'd stave off a fight if we tried to stand up for Cam. We looked at each other, nodded, and tacitly agreed that we were here until Beyonce and not a minute longer.

As the game went to halftime the bartender switched off the TV sound so he could blast Billy Joel's ""Scenes From an Italian Restaurant."" ""Tradition,"" he said, when I frantically elbowed my way to the bar. ""We'll turn it back off when the song ends."" Coldplay ceded the stage to the premminent pop star of our time  a black woman clad in Black Panther tribute, hurling New Orleans references at a nationwide audience  and in one corner of our city she was muted, as per tradition.","['mardi', 'orleans', 'school', 'gras', 'city', 'creole', 'watching', 'video', 'black', 'beyonc', 'formation']"
npr,2014-07-28 00:00:00,Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities' : Code Switch : NPR,[],"Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities'

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great car tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.","['migration', 'life', 'code', 'ghosh', 'explore', 'modernday', 'car', 'tales', 'hyphenated', 'switch', 'writers', 'odysseys', 'sea', 'train', 'world', 'ship', 'identities', 'journey', 'npr']"

A BBC journalist tweeted Wednesday that Queen Elizabeth II had been admitted to King Edward VIIs Hospital in London, leading at least one other major news outlet  CNN  to tell its affiliates that the queen had been hospitalized and setting off speculation that she had died.

The queen is apparently fine and is not in the hospital. The backstory, according to the BBC, is that it was conducting a technical rehearsal for an obituary and tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist.

The BBC has apologized. CNN, which tweeted the news without citing any source, subsequently told affiliates to please disregard our previous tweet about Queen Elizabeth. It was sent in error.

Poynters Benjamin Mullin has more here.

We should note that there but for the grace of God go we. But this is also a reminder of why, as the Ethics Handbook says, we do not just spread information we see on social media, even if its posted by usually reliable news outlets. We are careful and skeptical.

Heres part of what we say in the handbook:

When determining whether to pass along information being reported on social media sites by other news outlets or individuals, be thoughtful. When we point to what others are saying, in the eyes of many we are effectively reporting that information ourselves. ... Above all, proceed with caution, especially when news is breaking and accounts vary widely about what is happening. Reach out to other sources for confirmation. And the general standard is simple: Tweet and retweet as if what youre saying or passing along is information that you would put on the air or in a traditional NPR.org news story. If it needs context, attribution, clarification or knocking down, provide it. News moves fast on the Internet, and we know that speed and accuracy are fierce rivals, so keep your guard up. Ask questions, report and engage as you would in any public setting. But remember that everything you say or do in a social media environment is effectively a public statement from an NPR journalist, so dont pass along inaccurate information.

i toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Harper Lee, the author of the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, has died in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer was 89.

Monroeville city officials confirmed reports of Lee's death to Alabama Public Radio. Her publisher, HarperCollins, also confirmed the news to NPR.

Her famous novel about a young girl's experience of racial tensions in a small Southern town has sold tens of millions of copies and been translated into dozens of languages.

Lee's family issued a statement Friday morning saying that Lee ""passed away in her sleep early this morning. Her passing was unexpected. She remained in good basic health until her passing.""

Family spokesman Hank Conner, Lee's nephew, said:

""This is a sad day for our family. America and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century's most beloved authors. We knew her as Nelle Harper Lee, a loving member of our family, a devoted friend to the many good people who touched her life, and a generous soul in our community and our state. We will miss her dearly.""

The family says that as Lee had requested, a private funeral service will be held.

Lee made headlines last year, on the news that a companion to her beloved novel would be coming out some 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird was first published in 1960. When that book, Go Set a Watchman, was published last summer, it set off debates about the author's health and how involved she had been in the project.

An Alabama native, Lee moved to New York City in 1948 with the dream of being a writer. For about eight years, she worked as an airline reservationist at Eastern Airlines.

As NPR reported last summer:

""Lee's fortunes began to improve at the end of 1956 when her friends Michael and Joy Williams Brown gave Nelle, as those close to Lee call her, a generous Christmas gift: enough money to spend a year writing. That's when she completed the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman. The novel helped her find an agent, who got her signed to the publisher J.B. Lippincott. But Go Set a Watchman was never released. Instead, Lee's editor urged her to expand on the flashback passages set during Scout's childhood. Lee spent more than two years writing and rewriting the novel that became known as To Kill a Mockingbird.""

When it was published in 1960, To Kill a Mockingbird found immediate success. Lee won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction the following year, and the novel inspired a film adaptation that came out in 1962 starring Mary Badham as Scout and Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.

That film was also a smashing success, garnering numerous Academy Award nominations and several wins.

Lee was famous for avoiding the public eye  one of the last extensive interviews she gave took place in 1964, when she spoke to New York radio station WQXR. Here's some of what she said:

""Well, my objectives are very limited. I think I want to do the best I can with the talent that God gave me, I suppose. I would like to be the chronicler of something that I think is going down the drain very swiftly, and that is small-town, middle-class Southern life. There is something universal in it. Something decent to be said for it, and something to lament, once it goes, in its passing. In other words, all I want to be is the Jane Austen of South Alabama.""

In that same conversation, Lee also spoke of how she had attended law school, but ""I didn't graduate. I left the university one semester before I'd have gotten my degree.""

In 2007, Lee was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she was honored with a National Medal of Arts in 2010.

Here's how news website AL.com describes Lee's final years:

""Harper Lee suffered a stroke in 2007, recovered and resumed her life in the hometown where she spent many of her 89 years. A guardedly private individual, Lee was respected and protected by residents of the town that displays Mockingbird-themed murals and each year stages theatrical productions of To Kill a Mockingbird. ""Lee returned to Monroeville for good once her sister Alice became ill and needed help. She'd eat breakfast each morning at the same fast-food place, and could later be seen picking up Alice from the law firm founded by their father.""

President and Mrs. Obama released this statement Friday in memory of Lee:","['set', 'lee', 'family', 'author', 'harper', 'dies', 'morning', 'winning', 'lees', 'novel', 'mockingbird', 'published', 'pulitzerprize', 'kill', 'watchman', 'twoway', 'npr']"

i toggle caption Amanda Gray/U.S. Navy Amanda Gray/U.S. Navy

""Raise your hand if you have ever determined your location on the planet using the stars,"" Lt. Daniel Stayton tells his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.

A young officer halfheartedly puts up her hand. Another wavers. The rest of the class of 20 midshipmen sits stone-faced.

This is the challenge facing the U.S. Navy as it tries to bring back celestial navigation. The Navy stopped training its service members to navigate by the stars about a decade ago, focusing instead on electronic navigational systems. But fears about the security of the Global Positioning System, and a desire to return to the basics of naval training are pushing the fleet back toward this ancient method of finding a course across open water.

Navigation by the stars dates back millennia. The ancient Polynesians used stars and constellations to help guide their outrigger canoes across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean. And right up until the mid-20th century, navigation on the sea was usually done by looking at the heavens.

That changed in the late 1970s, when the military began launching GPS satellites. The satellite system provided a far more accurate fix than the stars could. In 2000, the U.S. Navy began phasing out sextants and charts in favor of computers.

Rear Adm. Michael White, who heads the Navy's training, says the change in curriculum was driven by the need to bring young officers up to speed on the Navy's equivalent of Googlemaps, called the Voyage Management System. It uses GPS, radar, and other tools to precisely track a ship's position and course across the ocean. The system is complex and, ""we don't have infinite training time available,"" White says.

i toggle caption Geoff Brumfiel/NPR Geoff Brumfiel/NPR

So, why return now to the old ways? The Navy and other branches of the U.S. military are becoming increasingly concerned, in part, that they may be overly reliant on GPS. ""We use it to synchronize all military operations, we use it to navigate everywhere  it's just something the U.S. military can't live without,"" says Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now with the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that studies security issues in outer space. In a big war, the GPS satellites could be shot down. Or, more likely, their signal could be jammed or hacked.

Already, jamming has become more common, Weeden says. ""You can buy a lot of GPS jammers off the Internet,"" he says. ""A lot of those are made by Russia.""

He thinks the Russians probably have systems to jam the special signals the military uses as well. And China may be developing similar capabilities.

White, who heads the Navy's training, says there is also a desire to get back to basics. Over the past decade, electronic navigation systems on ships have become easier to use, so less training is required. He says the Navy is bringing back celestial navigation to make sure its officers understand the fundamentals.

""You know, I would equate it to blindly following the navigation system in your car: If you don't have an understanding of north/south/east/west, or perhaps where you're going, it takes you to places you didn't intend to go,"" he says.

In fact, there has been at least one incident in the past decade when a Navy ship ran aground partly because of problems with the electronic navigation system, investigators say.

Back in the classroom at the Naval Academy, the midshipmen finishing up their first course seem a little bewildered. Until now, says 20-year-old Audrey Channell, celestial navigation wasn't on her radar.

""I mean, obviously I heard about using stars to navigate in the old days,"" she says, ""but I never thought I'd be using it.""

Like many of the others in the class, she uses GPS to navigate her daily life.

Her instructor, Daniel Stayton, says that's OK. Nobody expects these young officers to become Magellans overnight.","['training', 'using', 'young', 'brings', 'officers', 'system', 'stars', 'navigate', 'navy', 'military', 'navigation', 'gps']"

Victims of a shooting spree are being mourned in Kalamazoo, Mich., where Jason Dalton, the man suspected of killing six people Saturday, is expected to be arraigned Monday. Police have been trying to determine a motive for what seem to be random attacks.

Eerie details have emerged about the case  including a witness's account of getting an Uber ride from Dalton, 45, who was a driver for the ride-hailing service. The witness tells NPR that he rode with Dalton shortly before the suspect was arrested in the center of town  and that they briefly discussed the shootings.

""Dalton was driving for Uber that night and stopped after midnight to pick up Derek  who asked NPR to only use his middle name because he's afraid of retribution from speaking about his encounter,"" NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports.

That encounter occurred after midnight, more than six hours after the first of three shootings  and during a manhunt that had police on the lookout for a Chevrolet like Dalton's.

Here's what Derek told Hansi:

""I jokingly said to the driver, 'You aren't the shooter, are you?' and he either shook his head or said no, and I said, 'Are you sure?' ""And his response wasn't like you would expect, like a laugh. It was just very calm and quiet. It was, 'I'm just tired. No, I'm just tired.' ""

Dalton was arrested about a half-hour later, Hansi reports. On Sunday, Uber confirmed that Dalton was a driver and had passed the company's background check. Police have said he did not have a criminal record.

Michigan State Police believe Dalton is the man who fired around 10 shots outside an apartment complex around 5:42 p.m. ET, wounding a woman who is now listed as being in serious condition.

That woman, whose name hasn't been released, is ""a hero,"" Kalamazoo Sheriff Richard Fuller tells local TV news WWMT. Explaining that she was in an area where several children were when the shooting started, Fuller says, ""This person put themselves between the children and the shooter, right away.""

The violence continued more than four hours later, when a father and son  Richard Eugene Smith, 53, and Tyler Daniel Smith, 17, both from Kalamazoo  were shot and killed at the Seelye Ford Kia car dealership.

That shooting was reported at 10:08 p.m. Minutes later, the third shooting was reported, at a parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant. That's where police say four women were killed after two vehicles  a Chevrolet Cruze and an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan  were fired upon.

State police released the names of those victims Sunday:

Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Mich. (driver of Oldsmobile minivan);

Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, Mich. (driver of Chevrolet);

Dorothy Brown, 74, of Battle Creek, Mich. (rear driver-side passenger of Chevrolet);

Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, Mich. (rear passenger-side passenger of Chevrolet).

A 14-year-old girl who was a passenger in the Chevrolet survived the shooting and was listed in critical condition late Sunday.

Prayer vigils and remembrances were held for the victims last night. Gov. Rick Snyder has ordered Michigan's state buildings to fly the state and U.S. flags at half-staff for the next six days, to honor each of the six who died.","['uber', 'passenger', 'suspects', 'later', 'ride', 'shooter', 'driver', 'arrest', 'state', 'arent', 'dalton', 'mich', 'kalamazoo', 'shooting', 'twoway', 'came', 'npr']"

Saturday is Primary Election Day for Republicans running for president in South Carolina and Democrats in Nevada. NPR gives the latest.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

The 2016 presidential campaign has arrived at its next big juncture. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. On the Republican side, voters in South Carolina have been going to the polls all day in that state's GOP primary. In Nevada, Democrats have spent the afternoon at caucus sites across the state. Early results are coming in and show a very close race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. We want to check in with our reporters on the ground in each state. NPR's Don Gonyea is in Columbia, S.C., following the Republican race. Hi, Don.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hey there.

MARTIN: NPR's Tamara Keith is in Las Vegas, Nev., following the Democratic race. Hi, Tamara.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi.

MARTIN: And you are at Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas Strip, where there was a caucus today that you got to watch. Obviously, this is a different setting from what we saw in Iowa. But is the process more or less the same?

KEITH: Well, yes, it is more or less the same. People form preference groups. They go to different sides of the room to show their support for their candidate and then they're counted up. So it is very much like Iowa, except that it is clear we are not in Iowa anymore because I was at Caesar's Palace where just an incredibly diverse group of voters came out to support their candidates. There were people wearing their uniforms. So there were the chef's coats and housekeepers in their blue housekeeping jackets and cocktail waitresses in their cocktail dresses. It was a very Las Vegas kind of scene. I spoke to two people who were participating in the caucus - Nora Gomez (ph), who supports Bernie Sanders, and Norma Anderson (ph), who supports Hillary Clinton. And here's a little sound from them.

NORA GOMEZ: He was more explicit in what he really wants and what he's going to fight for - you know, for the students, for veterans, you know, for a lot of the same-wage work - you know, for equal pay and all that stuff.

NORMA ANDERSON: I think she's for African-American women. I think she's honest. I think we can trust her with taking care of the country. She's shown - she's proven as secretary of state to care about the country, and I'm with Hillary.

KEITH: And you can tell it was a pretty raucous scene with people cheering for their candidates. And the final result at Caesar's Palace was 28 delegates for Hillary Clinton and 12 delegates for Bernie Sanders.

MARTIN: So Tam, just briefly before we turn to Don, you said it's raucous. But what was the atmosphere? Was it friendly raucous, or was it...

KEITH: Oh...

MARTIN: ...Not so friendly raucous?

KEITH: ...Absolutely. It was totally friendly. People were having fun, they were chanting. I mean, there was - these are people who left work to go caucus, and then they were going to go back to work. And I think they were - a lot of people talked about just having fun exercising democracy.

MARTIN: OK Tam, stay with us, but we want to turn to Don Gonyea...

KEITH: OK.

MARTIN: ...Now. Don, South Carolina has a straightforward primary. People there have been voting since 7 a.m. this morning, and there is a lot on the line, is there not?

GONYEA: Oh, absolutely. This could change the shape of the race going forward. So let's start with the battle between Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. It may be the fight for second place because Donald Trump is still the frontrunner here. But listen, Cruz and Rubio have very different audiences. Cruz has been working the evangelical vote, which is very sizable here. He's been working it just like he did in Iowa. But this is a bigger state, way more spread out. So Rubio seems to have put his rough week just over a week ago in New Hampshire behind him. He seems a lot looser here, and he got the biggest endorsement you can hope for in this statement from Gov. Nikki Haley and from U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.

MARTIN: And...

GONYEA: So...

MARTIN: ...What about Donald Trump?

GONYEA: I saved him for last.

MARTIN: Got to hear about Donald Trump.

GONYEA: You never know what Donald Trump is going to say, right? At his last big rally here last night, he went into this riff telling this very violent story from World War I about Gen. Pershing and how Gen. Pershing brutally killed Muslim prisoners to stop terrorism. Now, there is no evidence that this story is true, that this ever, ever happened. But the legend has been around for a long time, but here's what Trump said last night.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: He took 50 bullets and he dipped them in pig's blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people. And they shot 49 of those people, and the 50th person - he said you go back to your people and you tell them what happened.

GONYEA: OK, so you never feel like you heard it all from Donald Trump, right? But that one kind of stopped everybody cold. Again, no evidence the story ever happened. Again, his point - America has to be tough on terrorists.

MARTIN: What reaction, Don, though to this - I'm guessing that there's going to be more reaction as the time wears on - but what reaction so far to this?

GONYEA: Yeah, you know, Marco Rubio called it a shocking story. And he said people should be kind of shocked and offended by it. But it hasn't been getting a whole lot of buzz on the ground here today.

MARTIN: Today. OK - have to ask you, Don, about Jeb Bush, came in with such a commanding - came into this race with such a commanding presence - you know, the name of course, a huge war chest. This seems to be make or break for him at this point. Fair to say this is a critical night for his campaign?

GONYEA: Yeah, all of that just seems so long ago. And now we're all checking for vital signs. He needs a really impressive showing here or it's just hard to see how he makes the case to voters or to himself for that matter what the way forward is. You know, sixth place in Iowa, fourth place in New Hampshire, which was considered a victory. Third place here might keep him alive. Who knows? But anything less than that and they've got to start making some cold, hard decisions.

MARTIN: And I'm going to go back to Tam in just a second, Don, but one more question. South Carolina's a state known for some really bare-knuckle tactics. Has the Republican race lived up to that billing in this year?

GONYEA: Oh, yeah. You know how they make those robo-calls? You're at home and your phone rings and you pick it up and it's a recording? Give it a listen to this one from a group that's - a super PAC that supports Ted Cruz.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Put in the museum. Let it go.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: That's Donald Trump supporting Nikki Haley removing the battle flag from the Confederate Memorial in Columbia.

TRUMP: Respect whatever it is that you have to respect because it was a point in time and put it in a museum.

MARTIN: OK.

GONYEA: Yeah, that robo-call referred to the Confederate flag as our flag, so that's just a little taste.

MARTIN: A little taste there. So that's Don Gonyea. Tam, back to you very briefly. Nevada was supposed to be essentially Clinton country, not a tough race for Hillary Clinton to fend off Bernie Sanders. Has it turned out that way? What happened?

KEITH: It is definitely closer than she wanted it to be, and I think what happened is that Bernie Sanders has momentum. He had momentum coming out of New Hampshire, and he brought that momentum into Nevada. He's had these very large rallies. He also surged staff into the state much later than Clinton. Clinton has been here since April with staff working with the community, but Sanders was able to surge staff in.

MARTIN: And so to this point though - now, Tam, we only have about 30 seconds. So we're going to actually be talking to both of you throughout the evening as we watch it all unfold. Very glad to have you both where you are on the ground telling us what's going on. That's Tamara Keith in Las Vegas and Don Gonyea in Columbia, S.C. We are awaiting the results of the Republican primary in South Carolina and private and the Nevada caucuses among the Democrats. Don Gonyea, Tamara Keith, thank you both. We'll be talking to you both later on.

GONYEA: All right, we'll be here.

KEITH: You're welcome.

npr,,Stories About Illinois Police Officers Death Underscore Need To Attribute,[],"Stories About Illinois Police Officers Death Underscore Need To Attribute

A look back at our coverage of what happened to Illinois police Lt. Charles Gliniewicz, who authorities now say killed himself, highlights the importance of attributing information and not getting ahead of ourselves when stories are breaking and investigations are under way.

Here are lines from five stories we aired or posted in the first few days after the news broke:

 Gliniewicz was shot to death in the line of duty on Tuesday  while chasing three suspects on foot.

 Investigators acknowledge they still only have vague descriptions of the three men Fox Lake police officer Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was trying to apprehend when he was shot and killed Tuesday morning.

 Lt. Gliniewicz was pursuing those suspectstwo white men and a black man on foot when he lost radio contact with a dispatcher.

 Before he was shot and killed Tuesday morning, Lt Charles Joseph Gliniewicz told dispatchers he was pursing three suspicious men on foot  two of them white and the third, black.

 The officer radioed to dispatchers that he was going to check on suspicious activity around 8 a.m. local time in the community of Fox Lake, Lake County sheriffs office spokesman Christopher Covelli said at a news conference. The officer, who has not yet been identified, then said he was in a foot pursuit, before losing contact. Covelli said responding officers arrived and found the officer injured from a gunshot wound and without his service weapon. The officer died at the scene.

The first three examples flatly say that Gliniewicz was chasing suspects when he was shot. The last two examples make it clear that Gliniewicz said he was in pursuit of three suspects.

Examples 1-3 skipped a key fact  that it was Gliniewicz who reported he was chasing three suspects. He was the source for that information. He was a single source. In hindsight, the attribution was critical.

Two other phrases in our early reports are interesting to think about now: Shot to death and shot and killed. Gliniewicz was shot. He did die. However, those phrases make it sound as if someone else did the shooting. If we had known he took his own life, we wouldnt have used them. We couldnt have known that, of course. But theres a case to be made that we should have thought through the possibilities and said before he was shot and died or some other phrasing that didnt include the word killed.

npr,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Italian Author And Philosopher Umberto Eco Dead At 84 : The Two-Way : NPR,[],"Italian Author And Philosopher Umberto Eco Dead At 84

i toggle caption Ulf Andersen/Getty Images Ulf Andersen/Getty Images

Internationally acclaimed Italian author and philosopher Umberto Eco has died at age 84. His death was confirmed by his American publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

Born in a small Italian town in 1932, Eco is perhaps best known for his 1980 mystery novel The Name of the Rose, which is set in a monastery in the 14th century. It was an unexpected international bestseller, launching his career as an author.

Eco didn't publish his first novel until he was 48, when a friend suggested he write a detective story. Before that, his focus was medieval studies and semiotics. And even after he published novels, he said ""I am a philosopher ... I write novels only on the weekends,"" the BBC reported.

Here's how Eco described his transition into fiction in an interview with The Paris Review:

""I have long thought that what most philosophical books are really doing at the core is telling the story of their research, just as scientists will explain how they came to make their major discoveries. So I feel that I was telling stories all along, just in a slightly different style.""

He told NPR's Scott Simon last October that several of his novels like Foucault's Pendulum and Numero Zero focused on characters that he affectionately termed ""losers""  because ""they are more interesting than the winners.""

""They have a more complicated philosophy,"" Eco told Scott. ""And then in the world, there are more losers than winners, and so my readers can identify themselves with the characters.""

Eco's works tend to be challenging and laden with obscure references. But as he told The New York Times, he considered ""challenging"" a compliment: ""Only publishers and television people believe that people crave easy experiences.""

Sometimes you want your history close to home. It's a good thing, then, that Ruth Goodman seriously commits to her research. In How to Be a Tudor, billed as ""a dawn-to-dusk guide to Tudor life,"" she recounts her experiences with lower- and middle-class daily habits, including Elizabethan hygiene regimens (not bad), rush-mat floors (quite nice), roasting meat on a spit (spectacular) and attempting to plow fields for planting (sad trombone).

This isn't the first time Goodman has immersed herself in a bygone era; she previously tackled the 19th century in How to Be a Victorian. For those hoping for an identical experience, How to Be a Tudor doesn't quite reach the same breadth of detail that went into How to Be a Victorian. Then again, that's no surprise, given that the literacy rates of Tudor England hit a maximum of about 30 percent, and documentation is trickier to come by  and that's before you start looking for genetically accurate manchet wheat to make your period-correct bread.

In fact, Goodman's Tudor research sounds like detective work as much as anything, from sorting out the proper bookkeeping allocations for shirts in tradesmen's wills to figuring out the invisible steps left out of advice manuals in their instructions for making cheese. But what you lose in extant documentation, you gain in the visceral detail that comes with hands-on experience. Her description of an Elizabethan suit of clothes is positively breathless, and tracing the amount of work that went into making even a modest Tudor meal is enough to make you want a nap by proxy.

The rush floors might be obsolete, but the crucial importance of ephemeral etiquette and the social panic about those who aimed above their station haven't changed at all. Scholars even released pamphlets scolding the youth on the bawdy language of their popular songs; if that doesn't make the past come alive, nothing will.

Given the mountains of scholarship on the high-stakes political landscape of the era, How to Be a Tudor wisely skips most of the court intrigue. Goodman instead concentrates on laws that touch on day-to-day life, each of which echoes larger concerns about scarcity, social climbing, sexual expression and global trade. Sumptuary laws prevented men of a lower class from wearing certain kinds of fur or forbade the purchase of imported cloth in order to boost local economies; licensing laws worked to prevent widows from turning their living rooms into alehouses, or to protect brothels from constabulary scrutiny. (And every detail matters  London had a brothel licensed by the Bishop of Winchester until 1546, which speaks volumes about the relationship between church and state, the role of prostitution in urbanization and how effectively the plague could shut down a business.)

This sense of the past mapped over the present isn't touched on overmuch by Goodman herself; she's here to demystify the past, with only occasional threads drawn directly to the modern day. (There aren't even many illustrations; in this book, the ways in which people spoke about dancing and the flow of energy through an evening is more important than an actual map of steps.) But at some point, reading about the everyday minutiae of the past ceases becoming a list of the ways Then is different from Now, and just becomes a list of malleable human follies that are separated more by wishful thinking than by anything else. The rush floors might be obsolete, but the crucial importance of ephemeral etiquette and the social panic about those who aimed above their station haven't changed at all. Scholars even released pamphlets scolding the youth on the bawdy language of their popular songs; if that doesn't make the past come alive, nothing will.

And at heart, How to Be a Tudor wants nothing more than that. Engagingly written and awash in the practicalities of life in the age, it presents a vivid, fascinating era of British history and reminds us that we're never as far from the past as we like to think.

i toggle caption The Kobal Collection The Kobal Collection

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.","['past', 'lure', 'travel', 'literary', 'thing', 'cant', 'machine', 'know', 'thats', 'willis', 'change', 'history']"

i toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images

A team of U.S. government disease detectives Monday launched an eagerly anticipated research project in Brazil designed to determine whether the Zika virus is really causing a surge of serious birth defects.

A 16-member team of epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began training dozens of Brazilian counterparts in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, in preparation to begin work on Tuesday. The researchers will gather data on hundreds of Brazilian women and their children.

""Having the data at this point in time are very critically important for understanding the impact Zika might be having in the future and as it spreads in the region,"" says J. Erin Staples, a CDC medical officer leading the CDC team in Brazil.

Scientists believe there has been a significant increase in microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brain, since Zika started spreading widely in Brail. That strongly suggests that the virus is to blame. And Zika has been found in the brains of a small number of babies with microcephaly. But that still does not prove the virus is to blame.

""Taking that and saying the 4,000 to 5,000 cases of microcephaly reported in Brazil are due to Zika is a very big jump,"" Staples says.

To try to better understand whether the association is real, the CDC is launching what is known as a ""case-control"" study, which involves comparing cases of people with diseases with similar people who did not have disease to try to identify the cause.

On Monday, the CDC planned to form eight teams of American and Brazilian investigators. On Tuesday, the teams planned to fan out in the region searching for about 100 mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly since the Zika outbreak began.

The teams will collect blood samples from the mothers and children to test for signs of Zika infection, examine the babies and gather detailed information from the mothers. Among the information the researchers plan to collect is whether the women experienced any symptoms of Zika infection during their pregnancies and, if so, when.

The investigators will also ask the women a series of questions aimed at identifying any other factors that may have played a role in the birth defects, such as whether the women had any other infections, including toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus. In addition, they'll try to determine if the women were exposed to anything in the environment, such as mercury or pesticides, that could be to blame.

The investigators planned to do the same thing with several hundred other women who are similar in terms of their ages, locations and socioeconomic status who gave birth to healthy babies around the same time. The researchers will then compare the two groups.

The hope is that this study will either provide more definitive evidence establishing the link between Zika and microcephaly or identify other factors that may be to blame, either in combination with Zika or instead of Zika.

""What we're really trying to do is to better understand what's going on in terms of the size, the scope and the causes of microcephaly,"" Staples told NPR's Shots blog last week. ""We want to better understand the role the Zika virus has in the outbreak of microcephaly.""

Staples estimated it would take three or four weeks to collect all the data, but was unsure how long the analysis would take.

But ""hopefully from all this work we will glean some information that we'll be able to help us prevent other children from being born microcephaly,"" Staples says.

The virus is spreading rapidly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Dozens of travelers have arrived in the United States after being infected elsewhere, but so far the virus is only known to have spread once in the continental United States, and that was through sexual contact.

The mosquito that spreads the virus is found in parts of the United States, but health authorities have said they are optimistic any transmission in this country would be quickly controlled.","['brazil', 'arrives', 'staples', 'cdc', 'birth', 'investigate', 'possible', 'virus', 'united', 'link', 'babies', 'microcephaly', 'women', 'zika']"

The PBS-distributed show Finding Your Roots says its mission is to help people discover long-lost relatives hidden for generations within the branches of their family trees. But it granted actor Ben Afflecks request that it not mention his slave-owning ancestor. Affleck says he was embarrassed by the discovery and didnt want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves.

For the record, the decision made by Finding Your Roots was not in line with our standards.

PBS ombudsman Michael Getler has had some things to say about what happened:

 Any serious program about genealogy, especially dealing with celebrities, cannot leave out a slave-owning ancestor.  This censorship should have been stopped cold and mistakes should have been admitted publicly.

The cover of Santigold's 99 shows Santi White as she's shrink-wrapped tight like a Barbie doll amid a candy-colored clutter of lifestyle accessories. Smacked right onto the cheapo cellophane, a yellow price tag declares the album's title, as if it's a dollar bin  or, perhaps, taking a clever dig at the cost of a single song. But as the singer, producer and fashion-forward mastermind makes clear throughout the album, the photo is also a statement about how each of us commodifies our image and namesake into a manicured, marketable brand, suitable for consumption.

From the beginning, Santigold has threaded the needle between engaging with the mass pop-culture machine and critiquing it with an outsider's remove. In early songs like ""L.E.S. Artistes,"" White  who for a time worked as a major-label A&R rep, wrote songs for pop stars and fronted the punk band Stiffed  called out New York's trendiest scenes for being more enamored with optics than making art with lasting value. Later, on 2012's Master Of My Make Believe, and especially its ecstatic single ""Disparate Youth,"" she alludes to revolutionary movements in world politics.

Following a hiatus and the birth of her son, White sought to create a collection of fun, playful songs that reveal even more of her personal voice. With 99, her third and finest album yet, Santigold presents a joyfully danceable record that shape-shifts between Technicolor electronic pop, brooding R&B and noisy arena-rock. She then savvily embeds themes of vulnerability and heartbreak, as well as outspoken ideas on art and commerce, identity and authenticity, and femininity.

99 kicks off with the head-bobbing ""Can't Get Enough Of Myself,"" in which White examines selfie-centric celebrity culture, then flips its script and proudly deems herself worthy of admiration and self-love. ""All I want to do is what I do well / Ain't a gambler but, honey, I'd put money on myself / All I want to do is bottle it to sell / 'Cause my brand of vainglory is much better for your health,"" she declares in the song's soulful, summery chorus. Paired with ""Big Boss Big Time Business,"" a bass-heavy banger full of clattering, syncopated beats, Santigold unleashes a swaggering feminist rallying cry to stand up to anyone who challenges her agency and power. ""Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one,"" she asserts, as if busting through the door and taking what's hers.

Santigold's songs are also defined by cutting-edge beats and globe-spanning influences, and 99 assembles another star-studded team, including frequent collaborators John Hill and Dave Sitek, as well as producers and co-writers like Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij, Patrik Berger, Hit-Boy, Zed's Dead and ILoveMakonnen, and many more. It's a crowded cast, each shaping songs with a unique sonic fingerprint  from the reggae-esque singalong of ""All I Got"" to the glossy voguing of ""Rendezvous Girl,"" the rubbery Afro-Latin dance-floor groove of ""Banshee,"" the lackadaisically off-key melody of ""Who Be Lovin' Me,"" and the slow-building synth ballad ""Run The Races."" But even with the expansive, mix-and-match aesthetic, there's remarkable cohesion of vision with Santigold at the helm.

Among the strongest songs, ""Chasing Shadows"" is refreshingly stark, constructed around a plinking piano that places the focus on Santigold's nuanced vocal and phenomenal verbal dexterity. Words fly off her tongue with rapid-fire precision in lines like, ""I give 'em my heart in words, will they remember me? / I'll leave 'em alone, and time'll want to smother what I say.""

The album closes with the dynamic, empowering arena anthem ""Who I Thought You Were,"" which channels the soaring guitars of David Bowie's ""Heroes,"" the shimmering synths and disco-inflected rock of LCD Soundsystem, and the sneering attitude of Siouxsie Sioux. All the hair-raising hooks complement an outrageously satisfying kiss-off, as Santigold takes down a former love for his fake hotshot persona: ""Hey, now, take a look at you / Hosed down in a million-dollar suit / But I knew you when that wasn't you / I knew you when you had a clue.""

Santi White has remained at the forefront of pop innovation while operating just left of its mainstream. As 99 demonstrates, she's at her best and most comfortable when she's pushing toward something unexpected.","['album', 'taking', 'santigold', 'pop', '99', 'single', 'shes', 'words', 'white', 'songs']"

Ferrante Fever goes something like this: You pick up one of Elena Ferrante's books because a friend told you that you had to read it. You read a few pages, and then before you know it, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning, you've finished the book, and you're on the hunt for the other three titles in the Neapolitan series.

This cultural phenomenon comes our way via translation  the novels were translated from the Italian by New Yorker editor Ann Goldstein. Ferrante is famously private  she gives no interviews, no one knows who she is  so Goldstein has become an unintentional face of the series.

But just in case anyone was wondering if Goldstein is Ferrante, she'd like to clear that up right away: ""No, I am not. I can say that without equivocation,"" she tells NPR's Linda Wertheimer. ""And I can also say I don't know who she is.""

Goldstein learned Italian late in life. ""I had this sense that I wanted to read Dante in Italian,"" she says. So she signed up for an Italian class at The New Yorker.

Goldstein talks with Wertheimer about her recent projects; in addition to translating Ferrante's latest, The Story of the Lost Child, she's also translated Jhumpa Lahiri's In Other Words, and edited Primo Levi's complete works.

Interview Highlights

On trying to take a feeling from one language, and express it in another

Well naturally that's my goal. You can't possibly achieve that in a perfect way because there's so many things you have to take into consideration. You know, think about every word, every sentence, every paragraph, and do what you can.

On whether she liked the Neapolitan novels

I loved these books. ... It's really the story of a young woman, or two women, growing up in Naples in a poor neighborhood. The way that they get out of it  or don't get out of it  that's part of it. But it's also the story of the mid-20th century in Italy so it's really like a social, historical and personal novel. I think that even though I didn't live in Italy in those years, it did cover that same type of generational upbringing that someone like me might've had in America.

On her philosophy  or lack thereof  for approaching different writers

I don't have a philosophy. If I had a philosophy, it's that I'm kind of literal minded. For example, I would never translate poetry  it's too hard, there are too many levels. Not that prose doesn't have many levels, but it's more grounded. I like to think of the individual words, then you put the word in the sentence, then you have to think about what that word means in the sentence, then you have to read the sentence in the paragraph  you're sort of building up like that; that's my philosophy.

On how she thinks of her job  writer, collaborator, facilitator?

Enabler. My day job, I'm essentially a copy editor and I think there are certain similarities because you're dealing with words; you're trying to enable someone to express him or herself as much as he or she possibly can, and I think in a sense that's what translation is. You're expressing something that's originally in one language in another language.","['youre', 'word', 'way', 'novels', 'read', 'sentence', 'thats', 'think', 'translator', 'goldstein', 'job', 'words', 'enabler', 'ferrante', 'elena', 'italian']"

The news of Harper Lee's death hit her beloved hometown particularly hard. Fans and friends in Monroeville, Ala., reflect on her passing.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

Monroeville, Ala., is warning the death of novelist Harper Lee. She wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" set in a place based on that town. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott spoke with Lee's fans and friends there.

KYLE GASSIOTT, BYLINE: Clay Brown was driving northeast from her home in Moss Point, Miss., to Monroeville when she heard the news about Harper Lee's death. Standing in the gift shop of the courthouse museum, she remembers reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and like the young heroine scout, awakening to the racism around her.

CLAY BROWN: You know, as children, you know there's something kind of hmm (ph), but you don't really understand what it is. And it's nice to have lived long enough to see things change.

GASSIOTT: Also visiting the gift shop is Monroeville resident Iris Matthews. She says she doesn't see any similarity between today's Monroeville and Maycomb, the fictional setting for the book.

IRIS MATTHEWS: That was something that happened in the past. Time has changed as years passed, you know. You do not forget, but you forgive, and you move on, and we grow.

GASSIOTT: Like others in town, Matthews remembers seeing the author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in local restaurants and stores. And while she knew Lee never liked to be approached, she couldn't help but think...

MATTHEWS: Wow, of course, wow, you know, natural in-town celebrity.

GASSIOTT: Nathan Carter is the director of the courthouse museum and someone who grew up knowing Lee as both a personal friend and someone who was close to his cousin, Truman Capote. And Carter says he wouldn't even try to guess at what Capote might say about the death of his close friend.

NATHAN CARTER: No, I would not dare to do that. He would come up with something very, very clever and funny and memorable.

GASSIOTT: According to Carter, it's the literary contributions that Lee leaves behind that will be her legacy in Monroeville, a legacy that was further cemented by the publication of another novel last summer.

SPENCER MADRIE: When ""Go Set A Watchman"" came out, when we did the midnight release, it was totally frantic. We have never done anything like that before.

GASSIOTT: Spencer Madrie owns the Ol' Curiosities and Book Shoppe near the courthouse. On the day of ""Watchman's"" release in July, people lined up all day to buy the book from the store in Lee's hometown. Madrie says both books are special to Monroeville where ""Mockingbird"" has become a local industry.

SPENCER MADRIE: ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee is our signature. You can't move it. You can't take it somewhere else. You can't break it apart from Monroeville in any form or fashion. So that's something that keeps this city moving.

GASSIOTT: Arrangements for Lee's funeral have not been announced but are expected to be closed to the public. For NPR News, I'm Kyle Gassiott.

i toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images

A team of U.S. government disease detectives Monday launched an eagerly anticipated research project in Brazil designed to determine whether the Zika virus is really causing a surge of serious birth defects.

A 16-member team of epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began training dozens of Brazilian counterparts in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, in preparation to begin work on Tuesday. The researchers will gather data on hundreds of Brazilian women and their children.

""Having the data at this point in time are very critically important for understanding the impact Zika might be having in the future and as it spreads in the region,"" says J. Erin Staples, a CDC medical officer leading the CDC team in Brazil.

Scientists believe there has been a significant increase in microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brain, since Zika started spreading widely in Brail. That strongly suggests that the virus is to blame. And Zika has been found in the brains of a small number of babies with microcephaly. But that still does not prove the virus is to blame.

""Taking that and saying the 4,000 to 5,000 cases of microcephaly reported in Brazil are due to Zika is a very big jump,"" Staples says.

To try to better understand whether the association is real, the CDC is launching what is known as a ""case-control"" study, which involves comparing cases of people with diseases with similar people who did not have disease to try to identify the cause.

On Monday, the CDC planned to form eight teams of American and Brazilian investigators. On Tuesday, the teams planned to fan out in the region searching for about 100 mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly since the Zika outbreak began.

The teams will collect blood samples from the mothers and children to test for signs of Zika infection, examine the babies and gather detailed information from the mothers. Among the information the researchers plan to collect is whether the women experienced any symptoms of Zika infection during their pregnancies and, if so, when.

The investigators will also ask the women a series of questions aimed at identifying any other factors that may have played a role in the birth defects, such as whether the women had any other infections, including toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus. In addition, they'll try to determine if the women were exposed to anything in the environment, such as mercury or pesticides, that could be to blame.

The investigators planned to do the same thing with several hundred other women who are similar in terms of their ages, locations and socioeconomic status who gave birth to healthy babies around the same time. The researchers will then compare the two groups.

The hope is that this study will either provide more definitive evidence establishing the link between Zika and microcephaly or identify other factors that may be to blame, either in combination with Zika or instead of Zika.

""What we're really trying to do is to better understand what's going on in terms of the size, the scope and the causes of microcephaly,"" Staples told NPR's Shots blog last week. ""We want to better understand the role the Zika virus has in the outbreak of microcephaly.""

Staples estimated it would take three or four weeks to collect all the data, but was unsure how long the analysis would take.

But ""hopefully from all this work we will glean some information that we'll be able to help us prevent other children from being born microcephaly,"" Staples says.

The virus is spreading rapidly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Dozens of travelers have arrived in the United States after being infected elsewhere, but so far the virus is only known to have spread once in the continental United States, and that was through sexual contact.

The mosquito that spreads the virus is found in parts of the United States, but health authorities have said they are optimistic any transmission in this country would be quickly controlled.","['brazil', 'arrives', 'staples', 'cdc', 'birth', 'investigate', 'possible', 'virus', 'united', 'link', 'babies', 'microcephaly', 'women', 'zika']"

The debate over whether Apple should unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook isn't the first time the company has clashed with law enforcement.

The FBI also wanted to unlock the iPhone of a drug dealer in Brooklyn. Jun Feng pleaded guilty to selling methamphetamine last year. As part of its investigation, the government obtained a search warrant for Feng's iPhone. But the phone was locked by a password, so prosecutors asked a judge for an order compelling Apple to unlock it.

""In about 70 prior occasions, this exact situation had occurred,"" says Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer, who's now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""And Apple had elected to comply with the court order.""

The fact that Apple had unlocked roughly 70 phones in previous cases was revealed during a court hearing last October.

And Apple might have quietly unlocked Jun Feng's phone, too, but something unusual happened. Federal Magistrate Judge James Orenstein did not sign the order the government wanted. Instead, he went public and asked Apple if the company had any objections.

""What was remarkable was that the public hadn't seen the argument surfaced,"" says Jennifer Granick at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. She says Judge Orenstein was trying to stoke a public debate. ""Judge Orenstein had concerns about whether the government's legal argument was a valid legal argument.""

The judge seemed particularly skeptical that the government relied in part on an 18th-century law called the All Writs Act. Prosecutors say it gives them authority to compel private companies to help carry out search warrants.

The government probably expected Apple to comply, just like the company had dozens of times before, says Hennessey.

""What All Writs is intended to do is that in those areas where Congress has not spoken, it's intended to fill the gap, such that the courts can effectuate their orders,"" Hennessey says. ""This is precisely how All Writs has been applied throughout history.""

But this time, lawyers for Apple disagreed. They said the company had complied when the law seemed settled, but at the hearing in Feng's case in October, Apple's lawyers argued that the government was actually asking for something novel: the power to force a tech company to unlock one of its devices.

It's similar to the argument that's now playing out in California, where the FBI wants Apple to unlock Farook's iPhone.

""The cases are different, but the underlying legal question is very similar,"" says Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The question in the New York case is whether the government can rely on this very old statute to conscript Apple into government service.""

There are some key differences between the two cases. The defendant's iPhone in New York was using an older operating system, iOS 7, which makes it relatively easy for Apple to unlock the phone. The iPhone in California is running Apple's newer operating system, iOS 9, and the company says it would have to create software just to unlock it.

Abdo says that's a conscious choice by Apple.

""They didn't want to be in the position, they told the court, of having to serve as a government investigative agent,"" he says. ""They wanted to be out of the business of spying on their customers.""

That may be especially important to Apple in international markets, where security is a big selling point. But U.S. law enforcement is frustrated by that argument. Federal prosecutors say Apple is putting its own public relations interests ahead of national security.

They think Apple could easily unlock the phones in California and Brooklyn  just like it's done 70 times before.","['doj', 'wanted', 'apple', 'writs', 'company', 'argument', 'brooklyn', 'seeds', 'iphone', 'sown', 'unlock', 'apples', 'judge', 'law', 'public', 'standoff']"

The New York Times is reviewing some of its reporting about the San Bernardino terrorist couple, Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple writes. The Times is looking back at a story that said Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik had talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad.

The Times is examining the story and the anonymous sourcing for that claim because the FBI says it has not found any public social media postings by Farook and Malik that might have tipped off authorities to the couples extremist views, as The Two-Way writes. Instead, it looks like the couple communicated via emails and private messages.

Whether the communications were public or private is important. Wemple calls it a gigantic deal because the Times story went on to say that American immigration officials failed to uncover what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide  that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad. Thats a damning conclusion if the couple had been communicating in the open. If they werent doing that, the story went too far.

But this Memmo isnt just about what the Times did. Its about what NPR did.

Carrie Johnson, Dina Temple-Raston, Phil Ewing, Martin Kaste, Nathan Rott, Richard Gonzalez, Matt Guilhem, the Two-Way team, the Newscast desk and everyone else who touched the story* stuck to what we were confident we could say and avoided things that werent solid. They were precise in their language. For example, we were careful to say federal sources were telling NPR that Malik had posted a message on Facebook at the time of the shooting. That information has held up.

Thanks.

Chicago hip-hop superstar Chance the Rapper got his name because nobody believed a guy named Chancelor Bennett could rap. Originally broadcast Aug 1, 2015.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Last summer, we did our show outdoors at Chicago's Millennium Park in front up to 20,000 people.

BILL KURTIS: But they were there for us. They were there for our guest, Chance the Rapper.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SAGAL: And now the game where we ask very cool people about very lame things.

CHANCELLOR BENNETT: (Laughter).

SAGAL: Oh, you're going to work out great, I can tell.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Chance the Rapper got his name because nobody would believe a guy named Chancellor Bennett could rap. As far as we see it, he's the king of Chicago hip-hop. Who cares about that Kanye guy? And we are delighted to have him with us today. Chance the Rapper, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

BENNETT: Thanks for having me.

(APPLAUSE)

BENNETT: Great to be here.

SAGAL: Yeah, great to have you.

BENNETT: Thank you.

SAGAL: So you're a Chicago guy. You grew up in the South Side.

BENNETT: Yes, sir.

SAGAL: And you haven't been growing up for very long. You're only about - what, you're 23?

BENNETT: I'm 22. I'll be 23 next year.

SAGAL: You're 22, yeah, yeah, yeah.

BENNETT: Yeah, I'm a young guy.

SAGAL: You are. And this is the story we heard, which is that you've been performing since you were a kid, right?

BENNETT: Yeah, I started out doing talent shows and open mic programs and youth programs around the city, and yeah, I've been doing it for a while now.

SAGAL: We heard you - at one point you did a fine Michael Jackson impersonation.

BENNETT: Wow, that's crazy. That's deep. Yeah, I did do that at my kindergarten graduation. I...

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: Yeah, so less than 20 years ago, but yeah, pretty recently.

SAGAL: So, but the thing - the story we heard is that if you have an origin story like a superhero it's that you were thrown out of school for a little while when you were in high school.

BENNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: And you took some time, and you - what did you do?

BENNETT: Yeah, so when I was a senior in high school I got suspended for having marijuana around the school. It wasn't even really in the school, it just - yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

BENNETT: So I got in trouble for this (laughter) for having marijuana, and I was suspended from school. So on that 10-day break, I started recording a project called ""10 Day,"" which was my debut project and put a lot of people on what I was doing.

SAGAL: Yeah, and my understanding is you put that on the Internet - you worked on it for a while, put it on the Internet, it was ready and it kind of took off.

BENNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: You started making your name very quickly.

BENNETT: It did a lot for me, yeah.

SAGAL: So you're touring in hip-hop shows, you've put out some albums that have done tremendously well, you're headlining festivals. What would you say now, if he or she were here, to the principal of the high school that suspended you?

BENNETT: Well, there's a strong chance that they're here 'cause this is an NPR show.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: If they're not here, they're listening.

BENNETT: No, I'd probably say thank you, shouts out to them for all the inspiration.

SAGAL: Really? For throwing you out of school.

FAITH SALIE: Hey...

SAGAL: So - go ahead.

SALIE: Chance, how do you actually compose a rap? Are you so talented that rhymes just come to you or - I would have to sit down with a rhyming dictionary and work for days - but how does it come to you?

BENNETT: That's a great question. I think there's a lot of premeditation, if you will, to making a rap, you know? You got to sit down, focus on your breathing, you know, you want to do a good workout, push-ups, maybe sit-ups, play cards, think about your taxes, think about all the people that you've met, you know, in this life and possibly a past life, if you believe in that. And then, you know, you take off your socks and shoes, put a pencil between your toes and you start writing. And you've got a masterpiece.

MO ROCCA: Oh, my God.

(APPLAUSE)

ROCCA: I should write that down.

BENNETT: There's a lot of steps, you should definitely write that down.

SAGAL: You understand that whatever you say about this, everybody here will believe you.

BENNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: They'll be going home and be like, wow, I heard the most amazing thing about this hip-hop. They write it with their feet.

BENNETT: (Laughter) Yeah.

ROCCA: Would you please give it to me straight. I'm 46. Is it too late for me to become a rapper?

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: No, I don't think so. Some people might say it's too soon for you to become a rapper, you know what I mean?

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: It's a certain experience.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Now I - I know there's like - there's different schools of rap, there's gangster rap, there's West Coast rap. I know that one of your big hits is a song about your grandmother, ""Sunday Candy.""

BENNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: Right now, you're wearing your cardigan.

BENNETT: I am.

SAGAL: So I'm thinking, are you, like, nice boy rap? Like he's such a...

BENNETT: I'll take that. I'll wear that, for sure. I definitely would take nice boy rap. I write - I like to write about whatever is closest to my heart at the time. And yeah, I mean I'll take nice boy rap, for sure, 'cause I think, like, that's what women are into is nice boy rap.

(APPLAUSE)

ROCCA: Oh, my God.

SAGAL: You have figured this out.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: One of the coolest things that I have read about you is that you grew up idolizing Kanye, right? And that - and you've performed with him, right? You did, like, a couple shows? Did he live up to your expectation?

BENNETT: Yeah, definitely. Kanye West is, like, one of the greatest human beings of all time. I don't know if you ever heard him say it, but he'll tell you himself.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I'm sorry.

ROCCA: I want to ask you, what is the rhyme that you're most proud of? Like, a rhyme that you went, wow, that is really cool that I just pulled that off.

BENNETT: I wrote this song in the late '80s called ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and...

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: I think I've heard that.

BENNETT: Yeah, that's one of the ones that I'm most proud of.

BRIAN BABYLON: That was all you?

ROCCA: There must be two words that you rhymed that you went...

BENNETT: Two words, back to back?

ROCCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

BENNETT: I'm trying to think of a good two words, 'cause I'm actually super into that, is trying to rhyme words that people don't use all the time. Oh, recently I rhymed - very recently I rhymed the words growth spurt with tippy toes hurt.

ROCCA: That's great.

BENNETT: And yeah, like, if you're there, it's like, in context it's like, OK, I see what this guy's got.

ROCCA: Can I tell you my favorite rhyme? You probably know it. It's from ""Funny Girl,"" and one of the characters says well, my heart ain't made of marble, but your rhythm's really horrible. Rhyming marble and horrible.

BENNETT: Yeah.

ROCCA: That's kind of - it's clever.

BENNETT: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, Chance - Chance, we have asked you here to play a game we're calling...

KURTIS: Chance the Rapper Meets Saran the Wrapper.

SAGAL: So you're a rapper. You're one of the best out there, but you can't keep leftovers fresh and tasty. We're going to ask you three questions about actually wrapping things. If you get two right, you'll win on behalf of one of our listeners.

BENNETT: OK.

SAGAL: So, Bill, who is Chance the Rapper playing for?

KURTIS: Meg Sharma of Chicago, Ill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right, here is your first question. People like to come up with alternative uses for Saran Wrap, but one of them, according to scientists, never works. What is it? A, wrapping yourself tightly in Saran Wrap to lose weight, B, stretching it down a stairway to make an in-home waterslide or C, eating it so you make a funny crinkling noise when you walk.

BENNETT: I'm sure A is the right one, right?

SAGAL: It is, in fact. Yeah, people do this all the time.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It doesn't work.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Could hurt you if you wrap yourself too tightly. Don't try it. Next question, Cosmopolitan magazine, of course, includes Saran Wrap in one of their famous sex-moves-that'll-blow-his-mind articles. What do they recommend you do with Saran Wrap? A, wrap yourself in Saran Wrap like leftovers, hide in the refrigerator and wait until he gets hungry for a midnight snack...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...B, take nude pictures of yourself for him with Saran Wrap over the lens so they're blurrier and not quite so accurate or C, pull out a long length of Saran Wrap, twist it into a rope and tie yourselves tightly together and see what you can do.

BENNETT: I'm going to go with B.

SAGAL: You're going to go with B. They say take the Saran Wrap, put it over the lens of the camera to make it blurry so your flaws might be blurred out.

BENNETT: I feel like that's something Cosmo would tell people to do.

SAGAL: No, Cosmo told them to do C, to tie themselves together with the Saran Wrap so you can't move or separate or get up and get out of there. It's totally sexy. All right, this is exciting. You get this last one correct, you win. Sometimes Saran Wrap can save the day, as when what happened last year in Chile? A, a mugger on the street was captured by bystanders and held by wrapping him to a lamp post naked with Saran Wrap, B, a man was saved from a house fire when he jumped into a makeshift Saran Wrap net or C, a desperate surgeon used Saran Wrap instead of a skin graft, creating the world's first transparent man.

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: Those are also ridiculous.

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: D.

SAGAL: D?

(LAUGHTER)

BENNETT: I'm going to go with A. I think it's A.

SAGAL: You're going to go with A? It is A. Yes. You all did it.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Chance the Rapper do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, he got 2 out of 3. That means you won, Chance.

SAGAL: Yes.

KURTIS: Good.

BENNETT: Awesome, awesome.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Hey, I'm going to make my suggestion, and you tell me if I'm wrong. If people out there listening don't know Chance the Rapper's work yet, a great place to start is the video for ""Sunday Candy."" Not only is it a great song, not only is it really different than what you've seen, but he is quite a dancer. You should check this out.

BENNETT: Thank you, guys.

SAGAL: Would you agree with that recommendation?

BENNETT: I'd agree with that. Definitely check out ""Sunday Candy,"" guys.

SAGAL: Chance the Rapper's new Family Matters tour has just been announced. You can find details at chanceraps.com. Chance the Rapper, thank you so much for joining us here.

BENNETT: Thank you guys so much.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Chicago's own Chance the Rapper, give it up.

(SOUNDBTIE OF SONG, ""SUNDAY CANDY"")

BENNETT: (Singing) She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me. With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, where her money ain't. I am the thesis of her prayers. Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers. Only one she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and J. Lo. I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma...

SAGAL: When we come back, getting high and doing crimes - seriously. That's coming up in a minute on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

At first glance, it seems like a charming cartoon, stick figure animation featuring a tiny child's voice. But the content is not childish. This short animated film, which is up for an Oscar, is called ""World Of Tomorrow."" The message of this story, about a clone from the future speaking to her original, is difficult to describe, even for the creator, Don Hertzfeldt.

DON HERTZFELDT: It's one of those things that if I was smart enough to explain it in words, I wouldn't have had to make a movie out of it. It's a love letter to science fiction. I've loved science fiction my whole life. But I've never made a science fiction movie. And it's sort of a parody of science fiction at the same time. It's all of the things I find interesting in sci-fi amplified.

WERTHEIMER: Well, let's listen to a clip. We introduce the two main characters. First is the adult stick figure.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""WORLD OF TOMORROW"")

JULIA POTT: (As Emily) Hello, Emily.

WINONA MAE: (As Emily Prime) Hi.

POTT: (As Emily) One day, when you are old enough, you will be impregnated with a perfect clone of yourself. You will later upload all of your memories into this healthy new body.

WERTHEIMER: So we learn that the little child that you just heard there is Emily, is the real Emily, or Emily Prime, as she's called in the cartoon. And her response, really, is just chatter.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""WORLD OF TOMORROW"")

MAE: (As Emily Prime) I had lunch today.

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) That sounds like a real little girl. Is this an actress being a real little girl?

HERTZFELDT: That's my 4-year-old niece being a real little girl.

WERTHEIMER: Oh, my God, really?

HERTZFELDT: Yeah, I was writing this piece, and I knew I needed a little girl, and I didn't want to fake it. And so my niece was 4 years old at the time. Her name is Winona. She lives in Scotland, and I live in Texas.

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter).

HERTZFELDT: And so I don't get to see her very often. And so we get together usually for the holidays, and I have, like, five days with her. And we just hung out, and I quietly recorded her while we drew pictures and played around with toys and talked about the world. I asked her questions, and I walked away with these sessions. And it was sort of like a fun puzzle to kind of figure out what she could be looking at when they're doing these things. And then once I sorted that out, I brought in Julia Pott, who voiced the adult Emily and rewrote her lines so that they could have a conversation.

WERTHEIMER: Now what you're stuck with is that what you and your little niece created here, everybody else is interpreting, being it seems as though you're exploring what it means to be human, what it means to have memories. At one point, the Emily clone falls in love. First, she falls in love with a rock, and then she falls in love with some kind of unintelligible being from another world. And you don't want us tempted to think that you were trying to tell us that whatever it is that makes us human, you know, it persists. It continues to exist.

HERTZFELDT: Sure. I hope so. You know, I think one of the reasons I love science fiction so much is that it's - when it's ideally done right, it's a reflection on ourselves. You know, no matter what decade it comes from, it's representing the present. I think, yeah, with the cloning story, she's learning what it's like to be human. She's learning what it's like to love something, and she winds up breaking this alien thing's heart. And to me, you know, everyone goes through that at some point in adolescence, you know. There's - you meet someone when you're a young teenager, and they're never right for you, and you always wind up hurting someone on the way to figuring out all this stuff. But it was a fun writing process, you know. I not only had Winona's little bits, but science fiction, it's worldbuilding. I mean, you can get away with anything. You can do anything, and it's so free. And, you know, to be animating at the same time, it's the ultimate freedom in filmmaking because you can literally put anything on the screen that you can imagine.

WERTHEIMER: I want you to tell us about the dark ending. It's one of the funniest conversations that Emily the clone has with Emily Prime. It's about how people are coming like shooting stars out of space.

HERTZFELDT: Yeah, I'll do my best to set this clip up. So time travel is a thing. It can be very dangerous, and it's also very - it's an expensive thing to do. There's a meteor headed towards the planet, and the lower classes can't afford to escape the planet. And so they're using discount time travel to try and desperately get themselves out of the time that they're in to a safer place. And in doing so, time travel is so unpredictable, and they're using this really cheap method. All they're doing is just warping themselves into planetary orbit. And so there's a ring of dead bodies around the earth, and so our characters are looking at the night sky, and they're watching the bodies fall like shooting stars.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""WORLD OF TOMORROW"")

POTT: (As Emily) The dead bodies burn as they return to Earth and now light up our night sky.

MAE: (As Emily Prime) What's this up in the sky?

POTT: (As Emily) Dead bodies.

MAE: (As Emily Prime) Look, another one.

POTT: (As Emily) Yes, it is very pretty.

MAE: (As Emily Prime) OK.

POTT: (As Emily) No, they're all dead.

WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) Well, you know, several of us have watched your short film here, and we had a lot of different reactions around the building. I mean, sometimes people were laughing, and some people were just incredibly sad at the dystopia that you have painted and what happens to a central Emily when she's cloned a few times. What do you expect the audience to take away?

HERTZFELDT: That all sounds wonderful to me. It's great for me to hear, you know, those different reactions because when I travel with a movie like this, it's very similar, you know. You'll hear a line in one city get a big laugh, and then in another city, the same line kind of gets a gasp, and that's wonderful. I mean, to me, you know, after working so long on something like this, it's great to go out and meet people and see the reactions and remind yourself that, oh, yeah, you know, I wasn't just working in a cave by myself for no reason, you know. There are people waiting for this and hopefully having some sort of connection to it.

WERTHEIMER: Don Hertzfeldt's new short is called ""World Of Tomorrow."" It's up for an Academy award. If you want to look at it, it's on Netflix. Thank you.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

A few years back, both Adele and Bon Iver invoked Bonnie Raitt's adult-pop sophistication with their wistful covers of Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin's ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" a ballad she'd made famous at her early-'90s commercial peak. It was a reminder of the influence that Raitt's full-grown insight has exerted on many serious songwriters and interpreters who've come along after her. Still, teasing out the emotional nuances in the stories she's chosen to tell is only one of the ways she's displayed depth over the course of her four-and-a-half-decade career.

What Raitt has done on her 20th album is go deep in the pocket, leaning on her gifts as a sensitive bandleader, bottleneck guitarist and producer, not to mention a paragon of modern blues expression. In interviews about Dig In Deep, she's spoken of shaping this dozen-song set not around concept so much as feel  of going after the grooves that she'd wanted to perform night after night. While there are some very fine ballads of regret in the mix  like the gracefully resigned, keyboard-padded ""Undone"" and ""The Ones We Couldn't Be""  it turns out that she was really in the mood to plunge into meaty blues, R&B and rock 'n' roll with her longtime road band.

A couple of '80s rock tunes made the cut because Raitt heard in them the potential for sensual play. She and her bandmates amped up the already frenetic boogie of Los Lobos' ""Shakin' Shakin' Shakes""; twice, she and her guitar foil George Marinelli swap unhinged solos, weaving her signature incandescent tone around his serrated attack. Covering INXS's ""Need You Tonight"" was an excuse to goose the song's angular dance-rock with a muscled-up rhythm section. And you can tell that Raitt relishes those fleeting moments when the entire band drops out, leaving her to vocalize with teasingly seductive intimacy. Her salty-sweet singing is a touch more hoarse than it once was, but she embraces the grit, making shrewd use of its lived-in physicality.

Several of the originals showcase the group's musical repartee: The strapping shuffle of ""What You're Doin' To Me"" and the chugging propulsion of ""The Comin' Round Is Going Through"" give her sauntering delivery something solid to push against, and the sleek syncopation of ""If You Need Somebody"" hugs her sly vocal phrasing. In ""Unintended Consequence Of Love,"" drummer Ricky Fataar and bassist James ""Hutch"" Hutchinson embellish their robust groove with funky anticipation and frisky, swinging ghost notes while Raitt coaxes a lover into rekindling erotic desire. ""Let's dig in deep and get out of this rut,"" she sings. ""We'll get back to what brought us both together, baby, and find a way to resurrect our strut.""

Raitt's approach to music-making set the tone for performances that have every bit as much to say about the importance of sharing in pleasure and being in sync as the lyrics do. Her responsiveness to her fellow musicians, and theirs to her, provides a lesson in how good it can feel to figure out how you fit together. For her, musical and emotional intelligence are inextricably intertwined.","['raitt', 'shed', 'set', 'tone', 'dig', 'bonnie', 'deep', 'shakin', 'shes', 'rock', 'tell']"

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

The world is remembering writer Harper Lee this weekend. The author of the beloved ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" died on Friday, at the age of 89. Family and friends have gathered to honor the writer in her hometown, Monroeville, Ala., which was the model for the fictional Maycomb of the novel.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DEBORAH HAZLETT: (Reading) Maycomb was an old town. But it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather, the streets turned to red slop. Grass grew on the sidewalks. The courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then. A black dog suffered on a summer's day. Bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by 9 in the morning. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was 24 hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.

MARTIN: Of course, lawyer Atticus Finch lived in Maycomb, along with his two children, Jem and his sister, who was the novel's narrator, named Scout. But in many ways, one of the most intriguing characters in the book is someone who is barely seen, a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo. Boo was about 6-and-a-half-feet-tall, judging from his tracks. He dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch. That's why his hands were bloodstained. If you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long, jagged scar that ran across his face. What teeth he had were yellow and rotten. His eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.

MARTIN: In the end, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a novel about prejudice, justice, fear and compassion - and Jem and Scout's realization that all is not right with the world, when Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, is convicted.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) It was Jem's turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. It ain't right, he muttered all the way to the corner of the square, where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the streetlight, looking as though nothing had happened. His vest was buttoned. His collar and tie were neatly in place, and his watch chain glistened. He was his impassive self again. It ain't right, Atticus, said Jim. No son, it's not right. How could they do it? How could they?

I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before, and they did it tonight. And they'll do it again. And when they do it, it seems that only the children weep.

MARTIN: Readings from Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" by Deborah Hazlett. Harper Lee died this past week. She was 89 years old.

A decision to bar Canadian citizens from being future contestants on TV's Jeopardy quiz show is causing a range of reactions in Canada, particularly among those who note that show host Alex Trebek has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada.

Media outlets in Canada recently noted that their country is singled out in Jeopardy's eligibility guidelines:

""At this time we are precluded from accepting registration information from Canadian residents. We are currently evaluating this matter.""

That led the Toronto Star to note, ""Trebek may be one of the only Canadians on Jeopardy! next season.""

The situation is being attributed to differences in online privacy laws  but some Canadians aren't buying it. Here are the two top-rated comments on the CBC's story about the ban today:

""We kept winning that's why! If you can't beat'em, ban'em""  ComplacentCanadian

""This is in keeping with the general 'dumbing down' of Jeopardy questions. The last college championships were laughable. You only require knowledge of TV shows, American Presidents, and the Bible.""  Maggie M50

That CBC story, we'll note, was under the headline, ""I'll take Bummer for $400: Canadians no longer allowed on Jeopardy.""

An Ontario native, Trebek told the Ottawa Citizen last week that while Canadian contestants have been on the show in the past  and more are also competing in the current season  ""for the most recent Jeopardy! contestant tryouts, Canadians were precluded from taking the online test, since the show must now comply with new rules set down by the Canadian government.""

But Trebek also noted that once they're in the pool of contestants, people stay there for 18 months, meaning that Canadians who registered before the ban could still appear. He also said the show's producers hope to make sure it is in compliance with Canada's laws.

The precise snag that's keeping Canadians from signing up for future episodes of the show isn't being discussed in detail. Reports in Canadian media cite a statement from the producers of Jeopardy! in which they said, ""As international laws governing how information is shared over the internet are ever-changing and complex, we are currently investigating how we can accept registrations from potential Canadian contestants.""

Citing two legal experts, the Star says the law in question could be Canada's anti-spam legislation, which carries potential penalties of up to $10 million for abuse. The newspaper reports that the law, enacted in July of 2014, ""forbids companies from emailing citizens without their express or implied permission. In the U.S., it's enough to allow customers to opt-out.""

One other notable piece of online privacy legislation that recently took effect in Canada is the Digital Privacy Act. Enacted last summer, it sets rules for how personal information can be collected, used and disclosed. It also regulates how companies handle cybersecurity breaches and sets steep fines for companies that don't handle them properly.

When The National Post asked the office of Canada's Privacy Commissioner how many complaints Canadians had filed about Jeopardy! potentially violating their privacy, spokeswoman Tobi Cohen replied, ""I can tell you that our office has not been engaged in this matter.""","['information', 'privacy', 'jeopardy', 'canadian', 'companies', 'contestants', 'note', 'barred', 'online', 'trebek', 'questions', 'canadians', 'npr', 'twoway', 'left']"

When Jeb Bush suspended his bid for the GOP nomination, it brought to a close a chapter in American politics that has lasted nearly four decades. A period when the Bush family played a major role influencing the course of the country.

The combined Bush family political stats just going back to 1980 are beyond impressive.

Two presidents.

One vice president.

Two governors.

Seven national campaigns.

And there were lots of victories, but unfortunately for Jeb Bush, the most recent one won't be going in the win column. It wrapped up among loyal, but sad supporters in a hotel ballroom in Columbia, S.C.

As Jeb Bush began his primary night remarks on Saturday, it soon became clear he was bearing bad news. He would finish fourth place at best-in-the-state GOP contest. Not good enough to justify continuing.

""The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken,"" he said. Then, occasionally choking back tears, he added, ""So tonight I am suspending my campaign.""

But let's start this journey almost exactly 36 years earlier. It was January of 1980, and the Iowa caucuses were fast approaching.

Among the six candidates on stage were Sens. Howard Baker and Robert Dole, and former ambassador to China and the United Nations, former CIA chief, former congressman and former Republican Party Chairman George H.W. Bush. Skipping the debate was Ronald Reagan.

It was Bush's first presidential run and he declared, ""I want to be a part of the answer, not a part of the problem and that's why I need your help as we go into these Iowa caucuses on January 21st.""

He was well received in the auditorium that night, and on caucus day. George Bush would score a surprise victory, narrowly beating out Reagan. That strong showing was a big reason he became Reagan's running mate.

Eight years later, it was Bush's turn. He won the nomination and beat Democrat Michael Dukakis to win the White House.

During the 1988 Republican Convention, Bush spoke modestly of his military service as a Navy pilot in World War II.

""I say it without boast or bravado. I fought for my country. I've served.""

But his most famous line of that speech was this pledge, ""Read my lips. No new taxes.""

The applause was deafening, but it was a promise Bush would break as president.

The reversal played a role in his defeat in his bid for re-election four years later.

One of the triumphs of his presidency was his response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990.

President Bush pulled together a coalition of nations to respond.

He delivered a nationally-televised address, announcing, ""Air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq. We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities.""

Opeation Desert Storm was a success. Saddam Hussein was defeated. But he remained in power, setting the stage for another war in Iraq a decade later.

In 1997, at the dedication of his presidential library at Texas A&M University, the ceremony was opened by the state's governor, George W. Bush.

He praised his father: ""President Bush was a man who entered the political arena and left with his integrity intact.""

When George W. Bush ran for president himself, some saw it as a way to avenge his father's defeat.

The 2000 election ended in chaos. Lawyers battled over the recount in Florida, where Jeb Bush was governor. It took five weeks and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to declare a winner  George W. Bush was president-elect. Al Gore conceded defeat.

Bush spoke from the Texas state Capitol, saying, ""Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements.""

But it was a nation bitterly divided into red and blue camps. Eventually Americans did rally behind the president, when terrorists struck on Sept. 11.

President Bush addressed the nation: ""These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our country is strong.""

War in Afghanistan followed. But President Bush then went too far for many Americans when he invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

The president delivered a speech in Cincinnati, warning, ""We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.""

i toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The stated goal was to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but none was ever found.

As the war dragged on, public support plummeted. It also sent Bush's approval rating downward, as did the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At one point his approval rating fell to 25 percent, according to Gallup, and voters drove Republicans from control in Washington.

In an interview with Morning Edition in November 2014, the former president discussed the prospect of a third Bush presidency, as his brother Jeb mulled a run. He was asked about those who said the country didn't need another Bush in the White House.

He was candid. ""In many ways the name is a plus and some ways the name is a burden, and you just described one of the burdens.""

But then he added, ""The environment is what it is. You don't get to rewrite the environment. And so Jeb has to think about whether or not he wants to be president.""

Which brings us to 2016.

When he launched his campaign, Jeb Bush would often be asked about his brother and his father. He declared that he was running as his own man, but kept tripping on the family legacy. Especially Iraq. Bush had a hard time articulating what he would have done, and he wouldn't criticize his brother.

George W. made a very rare campaign appearance with him at a rally in North Charleston last week. His 90-year-old mother, Barbara, also hit the trail with Jeb. They both remain popular with South Carolina voters and were very enthusiastically received, but to no avail.

The biggest problem was that Jeb Bush seemed to be running the kind of race that might have worked in his father's or his brother's time  but not now. The Republican Party has changed dramatically  moving to the right and rejecting the establishment. The ground was shifting right under Bush's feet.

Over the weekend, you could hear Jeb Bush finally coming to terms with that as he wrapped up the final speech of a disappointing journey.

""Thank you for the opportunity to run for the greatest office on the face of the earth. I love you all, God bless you.""","['chapter', 'closes', 'toggle', 'saddam', 'bush', 'nation', 'jeb', 'american', 'exit', 'w', 'politics', 'bushs', 'president', 'george', 'presidential']"

The groundhog did not see his shadow, which means spring is on its way sooner than normal. But it can't come soon enough for our friends at Alt.Latino. Felix Contreras and Jasmine Garsd host the weekly podcast about Latino arts and culture. They come bearing gifts of music to heat up the remaining cold winter days. And this sounds kind of hot, what we're listening to right now. Welcome, guys.

FELIX CONTRERAS, BYLINE: Hey.

JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Hi.

MARTIN: So Jasmine, you're not a lover of winter, are you?

GARSD: Um, I like the activities associated with winter, like hot chocolate...

MARTIN: (Laughter).

GARSD: ...And movies, but no. I'm...

MARTIN: I thought you were going to say, like, skiing and sledding...

GARSD: Yeah, I'm - like, I'm South American, so...

MARTIN: It's never going to be your season.

GARSD: ...This is not for me. It's never going to be my season. But I get to listen to summer, spring-styled jams. This is one of my favorite DJ duos. It's Tropkillaz from Brazil. It's DJ Zegon and Andre Laudz. Oh, man - I follow them on Soundcloud, and every time they drop a new track, it's just awesome. Check it out.

GARSD: I guess you could be, like, listening to this and going down the - in your skis.

MARTIN: Uh-uh. That says, like, summer to me. I mean, that's, like, windows down...

GARSD: Yes, yes, yes.

MARTIN: ...Like, thump, thump.

CONTRERAS: (Laughter).

MARTIN: That's awesome.

GARSD: Yeah.

CONTRERAS: You have to see Rachel moving her hands.

MARTIN: I love it. I love that one.

CONTRERAS: Yeah, (unintelligible) it's awesome.

MARTIN: That's super cool. OK, Felix.

CONTRERAS: Top that?

MARTIN: Top that.

CONTRERAS: OK. Well, I'm from California, so I brought a California band to remind me of the warm central California sun - not as boisterous or as exciting or as moving as the track we just heard. But it's a new track from one of our favorite bands La Santa Cecilia. And they have a new album coming out. It's called ""Buenaventura,"" and this track is called ""Nunca Mas.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""NUNCA MAS"")

LA SANTA CECILIA: (Singing) Uno de tanta culpa se queda mudo, otros tienen memoria para olvidar. Si la violencia es en espejo que se rompe, y nuestra lagrimas caidas gritaran. Solo recuerda que mi cara tiene un nombre. Y nunca mas se callara. Y nunca mas se callara.

CONTRERAS: So this is a different kind of heat.

MARTIN: Yeah, but there - that soul in that voice - that's good.

CONTRERAS: Oh, yeah. Well, Marisol's voice is always going to raise the temperature. They're on a very solid trajectory through the music industry right now. They've gone from playing small clubs to bigger venues. They have fans like Elvis Costello among their following, and also, the band members have sort of settled into the life of traveling musicians, you know. They've gotten married. They've had kids. Marisol had her first baby. And to me, all of that reflects maturity, and this album shows it perfectly. Don't miss it, ""Buenaventura.""

MARTIN: All right. So let's close it out with one more song, Jasmine.

GARSD: Well, like you said, I've been in a tropical mood.

MARTIN: Aren't you always?

GARSD: I guess so.

MARTIN: You kind of are.

GARSD: I brought in this Dominican trio Mula. And the song ""Retumba."" And I have to shout out to the awesome blog that I found it on, ""Remezcla,"" which turned me on to them. This is a Dominican trio. They're doing something really cool with a rhythm from the Caribbean which you're going to hear right now, which is dembow.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""RETUMBA"")

MULA: (Singing in Spanish).

CONTRERAS: That rhythm - it's so repetitive. It can be annoying, but a lot of people are using that rhythm and then adding a lot of different things to it. That rhythm is, like - it's so malleable and a lot of fun.

MARTIN: It seems like a party starter. That's kind of like...

CONTRERAS: And it's definitely a party starter, for sure.

MARTIN: ...The beginning of a good time.

OK, everyone. You can download Alt.Latino from wherever you get your podcasts and, of course, from the NPR One app.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says last month was the warmest January on record. That sets off alarm bells for climate scientists, but for the average person living in a northern climate, it might not sound so bad.

That's what many people are saying these days in Russia, where the expected icy winter has failed to materialize this year  to widespread joy. Of course, any climate scientist will tell you that an unusually warm month  or even a whole warm winter  doesn't mean much. It's the long-term trend that counts.

But that's not how it appears to the popular imagination, says George Safonov, who heads the Center for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. He says there's a big temptation in northern countries to believe that warmer weather can bring economic opportunities, such as improving conditions for farming.

""Before 2010, we had a rising harvest rate for crops, and that was explained as a very positive impact of climate change,"" he says. ""It was not easy to convince people that this is not correct.""

The problem, Safonov says, is that while warmer weather might open up more land in cold regions such as Siberia, it's already causing havoc on existing farmland in the south.

Some of Russia's most productive farmland, the fertile steppes around Rostov-on-Don, has been facing a series of droughts.

""We had one-third of all harvests lost in 2010, one-fourth of all crops lost in 2012. And if you calculate, that was about $12 -$15 billion damage,"" he says. In other words, a huge loss for Russian farmers.

We went to the Rostov region to see what farmers are doing about all this.

There's nothing growing there now, but driving through the miles of plowed fields, you can see why this area is called the breadbasket of Russia.

The writer Anton Chekhov said it was so fertile, you could poke a stick into the ground and it would take root and grow.

Vladimir Dvornik runs an agricultural cooperative called Progress, a former Soviet collective farm. He says he and his fellow growers have had to change their crops to deal with drier conditions.

""We gave up growing some kinds of grain, soy and some vegetables, like peppers and tomatoes,"" Dvornik says. Now, he says he has switched to winter wheat and other crops that do well in drier weather.

He says it's not a catastrophe for local growers, because they've had time to adapt, but drought could cause severe problems if it keeps getting warmer.

As for moving Russian farming to Siberia, Dvornik says that's nonsense, and so does economist Safonov.

There's no infrastructure for farming there, Safonov says, no expertise and no population of potential farm workers. Between losing farmland in the south, and starting large-scale farming in the north, the costs would be huge.

""Overall, I would estimate these potential losses as a few dozens of billions of dollars per year if we don't do anything,"" Safonov says.","['great', 'farmland', 'nyet', 'winter', 'farmers', 'crops', 'climate', 'weather', 'safonov', 'dvornik', 'russian', 'farming', 'change']"

A Spanish-language version of the consent, authorization, release and waiver form that needs to be signed by a parent or guardian before many interviews of minors is available to download and print here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1680218-spanish-minor-release.html

As we noted last summer, the English-language version is here: http://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=1263794-minorconsent

Meanwhile heres a reminder, from the Ethics Handbook:

Be sure to consider legal issues when dealing with minors (generally defined as anyone under the age of 18). An interview of a minor about a sensitive subject requires us to secure permission from at least one of the minors parents (preferably both) or a legal guardian. Examples of sensitive subjects include cheating, sexual activity, involvement in gangs or crime, difficult family relationships, probation violation, out-of-wedlock pregnancy or parenthood, victims sexual abuse and similar topics that could have legal ramifications or lead to embarrassment. An interview of a minor in a special custodial situation, such as foster care, juvenile detention, or holding facilities for illegal immigrants, requires the consent of the person who has custody of the minor. Utah also requires the consent of both the custodian of the juvenile facility and the minors parent. An interview on a non-sensitive topic (normal childhood activities, sports, book, movies, trips to the zoo, baseball and the like) does not require consent. Generally however, any interview on school premises will require the permission of the school authorities. In cases where there is even a hint of doubt about whether to get consent, contact our legal team (look for LegalAlert in the NPR internal email address book).

npr,2016-02-15 00:00:00,"'Why We Came to the City', By Kristopher Jansma",[],"What The Sitcoms Don't Tell You About New York City Friendships

There's no shortage of contemporary writing about New York. While that's not surprising  it's the largest city in the country, and has always had a special hold on the American imagination  it sometimes seems like it's hard to find new fiction not set in the five (but usually just two) boroughs. That's a problem for aspiring novelists who couldn't care less about the city, but it's also one for New York writers struggling to find something new to say about their hometown.

Brooklyn-based Kristopher Jansma, author of the stunning new novel Why We Came to the City, is not afflicted with this problem. His book is both a love note and a breakup letter to New York, and he captures perfectly the way young people give themselves to the city, and what the city gives to  and takes from  them.

A novelist is lucky if he can hook a reader in the first 20 pages. Jansma does this in his first few lines: ""We came to the city because we wished to live haphazardly, to reach for only the least realistic of our desires, and to see if we could not learn what our failures had to teach, and not, when we came to live, discover that we had never died.""

The ""we"" here is a tight-knit group of college friends who moved to New York five years before the novel begins. There's Sara, a journalist and the group's de facto leader, and her boyfriend, George, an astronomer struggling with addiction. They still keep in close touch with Jacob, a hospital orderly (""Once Jacob had written poetry, but now he was just a poet""), and Irene, a sculptor and art gallery employee.

The novel begins at a New Year's party, where those four run into William, a college acquaintance and investment banker who has nursed a crush on Irene for a long time. Sara and George get engaged, William and Irene hook up, and there's an electric feeling as the group, heavily intoxicated on camaraderie and alcohol, welcomes January.

But the good feelings don't last long. Irene is diagnosed with bone cancer and forced to undergo draining chemotherapy sessions. Her friends, stunned, stumble through their changed lives  George tries to confront his drinking problem; Jacob avoids confronting his relationship issues (his boyfriend is also his boss).

It's difficult, on many levels, to write a convincing novel about a person facing a serious illness. Things can get maudlin quickly, and it's tempting to substitute phoned-in sentimentality in place of real emotional resonance. But Jansma doesn't make a false move. He explores Irene's treatment with compassion and honesty  it can be difficult to read, but it's always rewarding.

He is similarly adept at writing about the dynamics of friendships, which are always more complex than we assume. These aren't sitcom friends; they're imperfect, occasionally annoying, and there's not always hugging and reconciliation at the end of a fight. Jacob, in particular, is witty and occasionally sweet, but he ""could be a jerk when he wanted to be, and he nearly always wanted to be.""

Only the luckiest groups of friends have never had to deal with a crisis at some point, and disasters have a way of altering the architecture of relationships permanently. The group of friends in Why We Came to the City aren't immune to that. After Irene becomes ill, there's a dramatic change in all their conversations, all their interactions: ""Like old wood, we splintered apart at the slightest touch until we were nothing but tiny slivers stuck inside each other's fingertips.""

What makes Jansma's novel special, though, is his characters' relationships with New York. ""Why shouldn't we live with such hurry and waste of life? We were determined to be starved before we were hungry,"" he writes in the beginning. After Irene's diagnosis, though, that all changes, and their thoughts turn to leaving New York behind: ""And only when we finally got up, threw on our clothes and walked away did we realize that we had all been gone for years already.""

It's that kind of observation that makes Why We Came to the City such a beautiful, sprawling and generous book. Jansma is a brilliantly talented writer, but he also has a unique insight into what friends mean to one another, and what it means to be part of a city in which you never quite belong, but can't quite bring yourself to leave. It's a heartfelt novel, tender and painful and cathartic all at once, and even if the characters belong to New York, the story belongs to us all.","['city', 'novel', 'irene', 'jansma', 'kristopher', 'jacob', 'problem', 'theres', 'friends', 'came', 'york']"

One of the great things about the U.K.'s ""electronic music"" scene circa 2016 is how incredibly broadly defined it has become. It's turned into a place where the future and the past are incessantly co-mingling in dub's bass-bin. Folk narratives are being underpinned by abstract electronics, continental drifts of poly-rhythm and drone are smashing into one another, and the darkness of doom metal and industrial art-school leanings mix with some low-fidelity versions of house and techno. Old languages are mutating into modern expressions.

One of the record labels recently trying to document the continuously shifting discourse by repping many of its sonic dialects is Houndstooth, an artist-driven company founded by Fabric, a nightclub central to ambitious London electronic and dance music since 1999, and helmed by Rob Booth, of the great Electronic Explorations blog and podcast. Houndstooth's catalog mirrors its principals' defining features: manifold rhythmic styles and extreme sonic chutzpah, with artists like the house producer Call Super and new-generation junglist Special Request leading the charge. And all are on display on the upcoming compilation Tessellations, which celebrates the label's three years in existence.

As one of the first artists signed to Houndstooth, Snow Ghosts are central to the label's identity as well. The part that producer Ross Tones (who also records solo as Throwing Snow), vocalist Hannah Cartwright (who has also records as Augustus Ghost) and multi-instrumentalist Oliver Knowles play is that of grand goth-pop experimentalists driven by English folk motifs and deep bass drones.

Listening to ""Undertow,"" the group's excellent contribution to Tessellations, you'd be forgiven for imagining this song existing in a more metal- and prog-rock-oriented age. Synths and low-end are layered deeper in the background, while finger-picked acoustic and a wailing electric guitar accompany Cartwright's soft intoning about her emotions resembling the tides, all of them deep expressions in the tradition of tony English narrative. Yet somewhere around the fourth minute, this notion is given a shrewd post-punk update, as tom-toms start pounding and an approximation of a 4/4 beat arrives. The beach we suddenly find ourselves standing on is New Order's  also very British and fatalist, and, here, lyrically apropos. Suddenly, Snow Ghosts aren't simply extending the U.K.'s electronic music sprawl toward a grandiose past, they're doing something to reconfigure it.

Tessellations is out on February 26 on Houndstooth.","['undertow', 'suddenly', 'labels', 'uks', 'snow', 'houndstooth', 'courtesy', 'music', 'ghosts', 'electronic', 'tessellations']"
npr,2016-02-20 00:00:00,The Latest On The Nevada Caucuses,[],"The Latest On The Nevada Caucuses

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

We have news for the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has won the Nevada Democratic caucuses, the Associated Press projects. With more than 80 percent of the precincts reporting, Clinton's lead stands at more than 4 percentage points. She declared victory a short time ago in Las Vegas.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HILLARY CLINTON: Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And this one's for you. I want to congratulate Sen. Sanders on a hard-fought race here, and I want to thank each and every one of you. You turned out in every corner of this state with determination and purpose - hotel and casino workers who never wavered...

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: ...Students with too much debt and small-business owners who never go off the clock, tens of thousands men and women with kids to raise, bills to pay and dreams that won't die, this is your campaign. And it is...

MARTIN: Well, as the Democrats faced off in Nevada, Republicans have also been voting today in South Carolina. With the latest from both contests, we're joined here in the studio by NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. So Ron, let's start with Hillary Clinton. How big a win was this for her?

RON ELVING, BYLINE: Absolutely essential, Michel, to restore the momentum that she lost when she was clobbered in New Hampshire earlier this month. She had to get that mojo back before she went on into South Carolina, which is a week from today. And South Carolina is really the fulcrum from which he goes on to Super Tuesday on March 1. She needed this to get her momentum back.

MARTIN: But Bernie Sanders had momentum heading into this contest. Could you talk about this for a minute? And I do want to mention that he has acknowledged the Clinton victory. He issued a statement just a few minutes ago congratulating her on her victory. But what did he do there?

ELVING: He has had an extraordinary surge throughout the last couple three months, really, when he brought his campaign back from needing life-support. And he has overwhelmed her in New Hampshire, virtually tied her in Iowa. If he could've won here tonight, he really would be knocking out all the props underneath her argument of inevitability. So he needed to do that, and he did it almost to the degree that he needed to. But he fell just a little bit short, a few percentage points. He went straight at the Latino vote, appears to have won the Latino vote in Nevada. That was crucial - about 18 percent of the vote overall and again, crushed her among younger voters, people under 30.

MARTIN: OK, very briefly - we have about 30 seconds - let's talk about the Republicans voting today in South Carolina. Polls close in just a few minutes. We don't have a winner get. Whatever things looking?

ELVING: We don't know yet who's going to win. We know a lot of people have a lot on the line. We know most of the people who came out to vote are evangelicals, call themselves born-again Christians. That vote is dividing itself among Trump, Rubio and also Ted Cruz. It is not clear who will take to it yet.

MARTIN: That's NPR's Ron Elving with the latest on today's presidential contest. Please stay with us on the air and online because the polls are about to close in South Carolina.

npr,2016-02-21 00:00:00,'Tender' Author Calls Novel On Friendship 'Autobiographical To Its Core',[],"'Tender' Author Calls Novel On Friendship 'Autobiographical To Its Core'

Adolescence is a time when ""friendship feels like something you die for,"" says Irish author Belinda McKeon. It's how she explains the characters in her new novel ""Tender"" to NPR's Rachel Martin.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Catherine Reilly and James Flynn are best friends. They meet in Dublin while Catherine is at college. She's an experienced student at Trinity College who has never had a romance. James is a charismatic and charming artist, gay in the late '90s, when it was difficult to be gay in Ireland. They connect with a force and intensity that makes their friendship special - so special, it feels life-sustaining. But it is also all-consuming and ultimately disastrous. The Irish writer Belinda McKeon's new book is about friendship, desire and the mistakes we make when we're young. The book is called ""Tender."" And she told us that she wrote Catherine and James' relationship as highly intense from the very beginning.

BELINDA MCKEON: But it's also that period of our lives - you know, they're 18 and 19 years old. So it's that time in life when friendship feels like something you'd die for. You meet with a person, and the connection is so incredible, and it's so deep. And you just can't get enough of them. You need - you know, you're looking forward to the next day and the next conversation. You don't want to go to sleep at night. You'll sit up all night talking. And so this is her first experience of a friendship like that. And it is all-consuming for her. So yeah, she's already I suppose confused by the nature or by the intensity of that attachment. But she's also quite a naive and - as I say, she's 19 years old. And she's from a rural background. This is her first year in the city. I wanted to write a very - a character who was very naive and who was blind to what was going on in her own emotional territory. And James becomes - really becomes a pretty severe test case for that.

MARTIN: When James comes out to Catherine as a gay man, it is not a shock to readers. But it is for Catherine. And she does not handle the moment well and behaves rather badly. Yet, you write that scene with a lot of compassion. How did you think of this character? Did - do you like her?

MCKEON: (Laughter) I - I have very mixed feelings. I have a complicated relationship with her I suppose. I mean, there's a lot of me in her. You know, there's a lot of my own self in Catherine, in her deep self-consciousness and her second-guessing of herself and that constant - almost as though there are three layers of inner monologue going on inside her head at all times. So she makes stupid mistakes. She says all the wrong things. And she's very self-regarding and quite self-absorbed. So I wouldn't say that I'm crazy about her. But I also do feel - I do understand her very deeply, I think. I mean, I created her, so I should. In that moment when James comes out, she actually is worried that he's going to ask her to marry him. That's how far away from having a clear view of reality she is. And that whole scene, I just wanted it to be so cringe-inducing. And my skin was crawling as I wrote it.

MARTIN: Yeah, I know - me too.

MCKEON: I needed readers' skin to do the same thing as they read it.

MARTIN: You say that there's a lot of you in Catherine. You also grew up where Catherine did. You went to Trinity. Does it extend further? Did you have a friendship like this, that was that intense?

MCKEON: I had a really intense friendship - and have, continue to have, thankfully, a very close friendship which inspired this book - its younger form, I would say, inspired this book. Its older form is much healthier and less dramatic. It was the late '90s. And like James, he was finding it - and I won't - I shouldn't speak for him. I won't say very much about his actual personal experience. But it was a difficult time to be gay in Ireland. And I think I wanted so much to be such a great friend to him. But I just ended up making things 10 times more difficult.

MARTIN: May I ask if you had romantic feelings for him?

MCKEON: Oh, we had more than romantic feelings. We were essentially having an affair.

MARTIN: Ah.

MCKEON: Yeah, never a dull moment.

MARTIN: Complicated.

MCKEON: (Laughter).

MARTIN: Do you think of this as a love story?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, it's a love story. Yeah, but you know, love has all sorts of motives. It comes from all sorts of needs. And it comes also from all sorts of cultural inheritances and hang-ups. So I think it is a love story but only because my understanding of what love is not just about happiness and togetherness. But it's just as much about the deeper psychological play that goes on.

MARTIN: Do you think how different this story would be if it were placed today? I mean, things are so different in Ireland now, the U.K. The resounding vote in favor of gay marriage passed in Ireland just recently.

MCKEON: Yeah, last May it was a tremendous day. I was there for that vote. It was an extraordinary, extraordinary day to stand in Dublin Castle and watch the votes coming in from each county. It was just - I can't describe how moving it was. But you know, the months coming up to that vote were really, really distressing because although the vote was carried by a large majority, there was a very vocal minority who were, you know, conservative lobby groups who were - got a lot of air time, basically. And so there was a lot of commentary which was deeply hurtful to LGBT people in Ireland, and especially to young LGBT people, talking about how they didn't deserve or shouldn't have this right. It wasn't a right and it wasn't something that should be extended. So I do think that if ""Tender"" was set now it would be - it would be different in many ways. But I have to say, I received a lot of correspondence from young LGBT people after the book was published, some of them not much younger than me and some a lot younger. And it did shock me how they talked about how they could deeply, deeply relate to what the characters had gone through and were going through.

MARTIN: Still, today.

MCKEON: Yeah, and that - you know, that really - that surprised me.

MARTIN: Has your friend read the book?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, he has.

MARTIN: Yeah, he liked it.

MCKEON: He liked it. But, you know, I should say, the novel is - it is a novel. I mean, it took a - it took an autobiographical experience as its source, but it is almost entirely fiction.

MARTIN: Yeah.

MCKEON: And I'm not being coy by saying that because I did think, when I started writing it, that it - that writing autobiography might be the way to write this novel. That turned out not to be the case at all. You take the bones of what happened or you take the feelings, almost the phenomenological feeling of what happened. And you have to - you still have to write a novel. It's still the same work of building a story, building an arch, giving it a shape because life doesn't have a shape. So all of the things I thought would be useful at the beginning - the journals, the diaries, the letters and all those things I have - they turned out to be just distractions on the way to actually making the story. But yeah, he's been supportive of course. He's - you know, he's a wonderful person.

MARTIN: The book is called ""Tender."" It's written by Belinda McKeon. She joined us from our studios in New York. Belinda, thanks so much.

MCKEON: You're very welcome.

SAGAL: It's carbonated water, seltzer...

ROCCA: Oh, no...

SAGAL: ...Is bad for you.

ROCCA: What's Bernie Sanders going to do?

SAGAL: I don't know.

SAGAL: So everything that is actually good to drink has been taken away from us. Soda is too sweet, diet soda too laden with chemicals. And if we whiskey at work one more time we'll get fired.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But at least we have seltzer, right? Sure, it has no flavor, but at the little bubbles reminded us we could still feel something.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Sorry, the bubbles in seltzer are created by carbonic acid, which rots your tooth enamel. So if you go ahead and drink that six-pack of LaCroix, you'll end up looking like an old bum anyway without the benefit of getting drunk most of the time.

SAGAL: We're looking for a...

JOBRANI: Chicken Caesar salad.

SAGAL: A salad, yes.

JOBRANI: Yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It is a salad. Specifically, it is a kale salad. It is actually, as far as we know, the first introduction of kale into a McDonald's menu. Kale, if you're not familiar, is a leafy green that white people eat to punish themselves for the whole Oscars thing.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Also...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Now that I think of it, if you are not familiar with kale, how are you listening to NPR right now?

ROCCA: Kale and quinoa are the twin pillars...

ROCCA: ...Of NPR.

SAGAL: That's where we get our strength. Anyway, McDonald's Canada unveiled their new kale salad - sounds healthy. But it's like a Trojan horse sneaking fat and calories into your body, except horse tastes better.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The new crispy chicken Caesar salad with kale has more calories, salt and fat than a Double Big Mac, meaning Canadian kale eaters, you're going to have to get even bigger yoga pants.

JOBRANI: Well, I like how they put the bad - the name of the salad at the front.

SAGAL: Yeah.

JOBRANI: It's a bad salad with kale.

SAGAL: With kale.

JOBRANI: You go oh, OK, there's a possibility it might be good, healthy.

SAGAL: Well, kale has become what bran used to be, say, 20 years go. It has kale, it must be good for you.

JOBRANI: Right, so it's like saying cocaine with bran.

SAGAL: Exactly.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

The world is remembering writer Harper Lee this weekend. The author of the beloved ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" died on Friday, at the age of 89. Family and friends have gathered to honor the writer in her hometown, Monroeville, Ala., which was the model for the fictional Maycomb of the novel.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DEBORAH HAZLETT: (Reading) Maycomb was an old town. But it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather, the streets turned to red slop. Grass grew on the sidewalks. The courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then. A black dog suffered on a summer's day. Bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by 9 in the morning. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was 24 hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.

MARTIN: Of course, lawyer Atticus Finch lived in Maycomb, along with his two children, Jem and his sister, who was the novel's narrator, named Scout. But in many ways, one of the most intriguing characters in the book is someone who is barely seen, a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo. Boo was about 6-and-a-half-feet-tall, judging from his tracks. He dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch. That's why his hands were bloodstained. If you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long, jagged scar that ran across his face. What teeth he had were yellow and rotten. His eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.

MARTIN: In the end, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a novel about prejudice, justice, fear and compassion - and Jem and Scout's realization that all is not right with the world, when Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, is convicted.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) It was Jem's turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. It ain't right, he muttered all the way to the corner of the square, where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the streetlight, looking as though nothing had happened. His vest was buttoned. His collar and tie were neatly in place, and his watch chain glistened. He was his impassive self again. It ain't right, Atticus, said Jim. No son, it's not right. How could they do it? How could they?

I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before, and they did it tonight. And they'll do it again. And when they do it, it seems that only the children weep.

MARTIN: Readings from Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" by Deborah Hazlett. Harper Lee died this past week. She was 89 years old.

If you havent read the news we posted Thursday, please do. Click on these headlines:

- Editors Note: Ethics Violations Identified In Several NPR Music And WQXR Reports

- Stories By A Contributing Writer Published On NPR.org That Contain Plagiarism

- NPR Acknowledges Plagiarism In 10 Music Stories

The ombudsman has also posted:

- Plagiarism Found In 10 NPR Music Stories

Before describing how this situation was handled, we should note that the Ethics Handbook is clear: Plagiarism  taking someone elses work and intentionally presenting it as if it is your own  is theft. At NPR its an unforgivable offense.

The Handbook goes on to say:

That means no material from another source should ever be included verbatim, or substantially so, without attribution. This includes material from Associated Press reports. We do not, for example, produce news spots or other pieces that closely resemble wire service stories. NPRs standard is that our writing should be our own. There is no excuse for writing that repeats the wire stories that we use word-for-word, or nearly so.

Now, about how things were handled once we knew the extent of the problem.

We started from the position that when we make mistakes, we acknowledge them. Steps were taken to do that:

1. We stated as clearly as possible, in multiple places, what had happened and what we had done to correct the mistakes. Thats why there is an editors note signed by Mike Oreskes and WQXR General Manager Graham Parker, an editors note on top of the page where the stories in question were collected and editors notes on each of the 10 pages where the pieces originally appeared.

2. We did not try to hide the stories. They were all put on one page because we felt that would be a simple and user-friendly way to make them available to anyone who wanted to see what was in those pieces that had appeared elsewhere before.

3. We highlighted the words and phrases that had appeared elsewhere and linked to the places they had been drawn from. Again, we aimed to make it as simple as possible for anyone to see what had been done.

4. A headline and link to the main editors note was put on the NPR.org homepage.

5. The Two-Way was given no instructions other than to cover the news as it saw fit.

We will make mistakes, though hopefully none this serious. Steps similar to those taken in this situation may need to be repeated. Having them written down here may prove helpful in the future.

Before finishing, a couple more things should be noted.

The first sign that there was a problem came last Friday when copy editor Mark Mobley was checking an unusual spelling and came across a document with phrases much like those in the piece he was editing. He brought the duplication to the attention of editors at NPR Music. That was exactly the right thing to do. Mark was then asked to start going through the pieces the writer had done for NPR.org in the past. His research turned up the multiple examples.

Tom Huizenga, Jessica Goldstein and Jacob Ganz worked through this situation with what I would say was firm compassion. It is not easy to deal with news such as this when it involves a person you like and have enjoyed working with. They stayed focused on what was the right thing to do for NPR and its audience.

We all owe Mark, Tom, Jessica and Jacob a thanks.

i toggle caption Patrick Adams Patrick Adams

His body wasted from AIDS, Fred Muzaya sat up in his bed on a January morning at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, and faintly smiled at a doctor he couldn't see.

A former taxi driver, Muzaya, 26, may have been infected with HIV several years ago, perhaps more. But it was only months ago that he finally went to a doctor  when a pain in his head that had started several weeks earlier became too much to bear.

The culprit: cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal disease of the brain and spinal cord.

A so-called opportunistic infection, crypto is a threat primarily to those with HIV who lack access to the antiretroviral therapy that can keep the virus in check. A healthy immune system can fight off crypto with ease. But in Muzaya, who had never taken the drugs, the fungus had spread unchecked, impairing a process critical to survival: reabsorption by the brain of cerebrospinal fluid.

Over time, the fluid, which is continuously produced, built up in Muzaya's skull, slowly squeezing his brain. Bedridden by an unrelenting headache, he became disoriented and, soon, his hearing and eyesight began to fail. By the time he arrived at Mulago, Muzaya was completely blind and nearly deaf.

Gently, Dr. Reuben Kiggundu, an infectious diseases specialist, took Muzaya's head in both hands and, as though calling out to a miner trapped below ground, spoke directly into one ear.

""Can you hear me, Fred?"" he asked loudly in Luganda, the language spoken most widely here.

Moments later, and loudly enough for all on the ward to hear, Muzaya called out: ""Doctor! I have no complaints!"" Then he curled up in a fetal position for the procedure he needs nearly every day: a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to relieve the pressure in his skull.

Muzaya lay still while Kiggundu moved a gloved thumb over his lowermost vertebrae and slid a needle through the tissue in between. As clear fluid rushed through the syringe and into a vial, Muzaya let out a sigh.

""The relief is immediate,"" Kiggundu said. ""They feel so much better after we do the LP. But tomorrow he'll probably need another.""

AIDS, we often hear, is in retreat. According to the latest report by Unaids, the United Nations' HIV-fighting agency, more than 15 million people worldwide are taking antiretrovirals. New infections have fallen by 35 percent since 2000; AIDS deaths are down sharply. If progress continues, say officials, the epidemic could soon be brought to an end.

And, yet, to clinicians across the developing world, cases like Muzaya's are frustratingly common. They're difficult to manage and most often fatal, and they point to what some experts say is a blind spot in efforts to end the epidemic: a persistent failure to catch the many patients who, for any number of reasons, either fall through the cracks along the ""cascade of care""  the journey from an HIV diagnosis to suppression of the virus  or, like Muzaya, come in for testing only after they've fallen ill.

Indeed, for all of the progress in expanding access to care, fewer than half of the 37 million people infected with HIV worldwide have been reached with antiretrovirals. And while retention in HIV care has greatly improved, roughly a quarter of adult patients in Africa are ""lost to follow-up""  they have stopped taking the drugs and are unreachable  or deceased within two years of starting treatment, a product, in large part, of the stigma still firmly attached to a positive status.

That's one reason crypto remains a menace. Globally, the disease claims an estimated 300,000 lives every year, roughly 20 percent of all AIDS-related deaths. In fact, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crypto annually kills nearly as many people in sub-Saharan Africa as tuberculosis  and more in a month, every month, than the worst Ebola outbreak on record.

Yet experts say it may also be the easiest to tackle, especially with the advent of a new rapid test called the Cryptococcal Antigen Lateral Flow Assay, or CrAg LFA.

""The key is to identify those patients who are infected before they ever get sick,"" says David Meya, a senior lecturer in infectious diseases at Uganda's Makerere University and the principal investigator on a study that looks at using the new test in Uganda.

Developed by Immuno Mycologics, a.k.a. Immy, a family-run company in Norman, Okla., the CrAg LFA is designed to work in settings where crypto is most prevalent  where doctors are scarce and electricity is unreliable. Unlike other diagnostic tools, the CrAg LFA requires no refrigeration, laboratory infrastructure or skilled technicians. Similar to a pregnancy test, it uses a dipstick and a test tube to detect the presence of an antigen (a substance that is highly predictive of the development of cryptococcal disease) in cerebrospinal fluid, blood or urine. It's easy to use and interpret  one line is negative, two is positive  and it's faster and more accurate than anything on the market.

But the greatest boon is that the CrAg LFA can detect a cryptococcal infection weeks to months before a person develops symptoms. That makes it possible for patients to avoid not only the awful symptoms but also the long-term, labor-intensive hospitalization.

""That is the key driver of costs,"" says Tom Chiller, deputy chief of the CDC's Mycotic Diseases branch. This CDC group has been working with ministries of health in Africa and Asia to design screening programs around the CrAg LFA. ""We know that if countries screen and immediately treat those who test positive, they're going to save lives and save money."" Multiple studies have borne that out.

Care for a single crypto patient in Kampala, for example, typically runs in excess of $400. By comparison, the estimated cost of saving one life by screening patients with the CrAg LFA and treating them with an antifungal drug called fluconazole, comes to less than $40.

In late 2009, Jeff Klausner, then chief of HIV/TB care and treatment for the CDC-South Africa, called Chiller about startling data he'd seen on the fungal killer. ""Tom said, 'We've been working on this for five years and no one from the AIDS programs have reached out to us,' "" remembers Klausner. ""I said, 'Well, here I am.'"" Chiller told Klausner about the CrAg LFA, then under evaluation, ""and I was like, boom. This is a home run.""

Months later, Klausner briefed CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden on the situation, ""and he got it very quickly,"" he says. ""He called it 'one of our winnable battles.' He said 'OK, this is feasible, it's cost-effective, let's figure out how to scale it up.'""

Since then, though, momentum has stalled.

To date, 16 countries have included CrAg screening in their national guidelines and drawn up plans for a program. But few have actually procured the $2 test or begun to use it in routine HIV care. And only one, Rwanda, has rolled out screening at the national level.

""Policymakers think if they just focus on HIV testing and treatment, crypto will no longer be an issue,"" says Klausner. ""And I think that's somewhat based on denial that the systems in place are not working well enough.""

Donors, too, he says, have looked the other way, focusing instead on ""upstream"" interventions that prevent new infections  like the development of an HIV vaccine. ""Maybe they don't understand the problem, maybe they don't see the cost-effectiveness of it, I don't know,"" he says, ""but they've dropped the ball on this.""

""Even people within the field will tell you that crypto is going to go away,"" adds Angela Loyse, an infectious diseases researcher at St. George's University of London. ""I've been hearing that since I started out in 2006. How long can you say it? To my mind, it's just not acceptable.""

But Chiller is optimistic that a champion will step up.

""We think countries can sustain screening for a relatively small amount of funding,"" he says. ""They just need the start-up money  $5 million to get it going, get people trained, get the supply chains in place. An organization that's willing to kick-start CrAg screening in these countries could make a really big difference.""","['fungal', 'lfa', 'hiv', 'kills', 'simple', 'klausner', 'disease', 'crypto', 'muzaya', 'patients', 'crag', 'screening', 'test', '300000', 'care', 'help']"
npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"The Battle for Room 314, by Ed Boland",[],"Yet Another Teaching Memoir? A Teacher's Critique

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

Book publishers love stories about first-year teachers. The narrative arc is familiar: Exuberant idealism fades as the teacher battles entrenched bureaucracy, stale curriculum and disengaged colleagues or kids. The young educator then tries to overcome despair with creative grit and determination and struggles to make a difference.



The books often teeter between self-promotion and slams against the public education system. Some, however, actually shed light on the yawning gap between reformist rhetoric and classroom reality.

This month there's a new one out: The Battle for Room 314: My Year of Hope and Despair in a New York City High School by Ed Boland, from Grand Central Publishing.

To get a take on how it lands in this genre, I asked a veteran New York City teacher to read it and write up her thoughts. Nicole Dixon teaches at East Side Community High School, which serves grades 6-12 in Manhattan's East Village. Here's her review:

When I first became an English teacher in New York City, I would often find my conversations about my job traveling an increasingly well-worn path: ""You teach at an ... inner city public school? Those kids must be tough!"" Whether these comments were made with an air of, ""Good for you!"" or ""You must be crazy!"" they felt somehow cut from the same voyeuristic cloth, especially when followed up by, ""You must really have some stories!""

I did, in fact, have many stories, but the one I found myself telling most often was a humorous one centered around my inadvertently stealing a student's backpack. I knew, of course, as I told it, that this was not the kind of story anyone had in mind. I knew from the way their voices dropped at ""inner-city"" (read: Black, Latino, poor) that what they wanted was a tale replete with fistfights and broken homes and gang signs and teen moms. A heartwarming teacher-as-savior ending was preferred, but optional.

I could never fully articulate why I didn't feel comfortable telling those stories until years later, watching a TED talk given by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. In it, Adichie speaks about her own experiences growing up as a child of middle-class academics in Nigeria, and then arriving in the U.S. for college, only to discover that her roommate expected her to be impoverished, unable to speak English, and listen to tribal music. She says, ""My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.""

I found myself thinking of Adichie's talk while reading Ed Boland's The Battle for Room 314. Boland, who left a position as development director for an educational nonprofit to try his hand at teaching, finds find himself deeply disillusioned by his experience.

Boland's memoir of his first and only year in a New York City public high school classroom certainly does not shy away from telling the kind of story about inner city teens that dominates the media and our cultural imagination. He opens the book with three epigraphs  a lofty one about the meaning of education from Horace Mann and one about the value of struggle from Alfred the Great.

And one from a student's ""Getting to Know You"" questionnaire: ""I like to fight, I like to f***, and I like pie.""

From that moment on, Boland's year is all downhill. Students throw spitballs, homophobic slurs, curses and calculators. He is disrespected and ignored, gets injured splitting up fistfights, becomes an inadvertent pawn in a student's drug ring and the target of another's accusations of sexual harassment.

Boland is the first to admit that his failings as a teacher were perhaps even greater than those of his students, unflinchingly detailing every disastrous moment. Including: a formal classroom observation that his assistant principal declares ""the worst one I have ever conducted,"" and confessing that he responded to one student's ""F*** YOU!"" with a ""No, Solomon, F*** YOU!""

Boland is candid about his own shortcomings, and gestures at the larger systemic and societal issues behind the problems in his school.

But he lingers longest on the outrageous behavior of his students: Chantay climbs on desks and hollers for Boland to perform an obscene act, and Kameron flashes his ""dark shark eyes"" as he threatens violence against students and teachers alike.

But underneath the grand displays of insubordination, the innocuous race and class-marked details of his students' lives seem to wear on Boland almost as heavily. ""I began to loathe my students,"" he writes, ""resenting everything about them that was their lot  their poverty, their ignorance, their arrogance,"" as if it is all behind him.

But his anger and disdain still pulse insistently through his writing.

It's not that I don't sympathize with him. Being a teacher is one of the hardest jobs imaginable. I remember during my first year the unique mixture of exhaustion and gratitude at the end of every day that I did not cry in front of my students. I remember repeating my mantra of ""just do less harm than good today"" over and over on the long walk to work from the subway. It's not that I don't recognize in his students some of my own.

Certainly many of my former students would probably meet Boland's definition of ""thuggy,"" a word he uses often. I taught, for example, a charismatic, budding Bloods leader who replaced all of his ""c""s with ""b""s so as not to accidentally compliment Crips, and a girl recently released from juvie for selling the crack on which her own mother fatally overdosed.

I know there were even moments at which I thought of them as ""monsters""  a word Boland uses so many times I stopped counting.

Teaching is a battle, and the enemies are everywhere: Poverty, racism, ignorance, rotten cops, wrong-minded government officials, greedy educational corporations, incompetent administrators, the occasional parent. I've wanted to annihilate each and every one of them at one point in my teaching career.

But the battle is never, as Boland implies and as many first-year teachers imagine, a battle against students for power in the classroom. Every time he suggests that, he makes the real battles more invisible, and harder to fight.

Boland's focus on his personal struggle to maintain order takes readers away from the more important national conversation about the societal inequities that are reflected in all of our classrooms.

And as a teacher, valuing compliance over the messy process of actual learning is a rookie mistake. Boland's older sister, Nora, also a teacher, tells him that his students ""are people with free will...[t]hey have very little power in their lives, so they will use it where they can.""

The longer I teach, the more I see how little power most students feel they have both in and out of the classroom. My most important job is to give them as much power as I can.

Had Boland stuck around another year or two (he left after one year and returned to his career as an administrator at an educational access program) he might have written his story quite differently.

What he might have learned as a second-, third-, or fourth-year teacher would be enough to fill a much more interesting book. I returned to school after that first year to find that something inside me had loosened, and that enemies I hadn't realized I had  my own fear and a tendency to take things personally  had fallen away.

Like Boland, who raged at union rules which prevented him and his colleagues from giving up their one prep period to teach an extra class that would make their other classes smaller, I hatched a similar plan at my charter school. In time, I realized the importance of time without students, and how many young teachers work such insane hours that they burn out and leave teaching.

I cringed at Boland's descriptions of how he planned his lessons  a seeming daily quest to find a different interesting activity to hook students and make them feel successful. But the truth is that my own first-year lessons often felt just as purposeless and desperate.

Years later, I've learned that the lessons that grab kids are the ones that ask students to do hard work that feels important and authentic.

In the end, I came away respecting Boland's honesty, admiring his writing, and vehemently agreeing with his pleas to integrate America's public schools.

It is a book that many readers may enjoy because it is a book that they expect, one of the two narratives (this time, chaos without the inspirational ending) about inner city schools that seem acceptable today.

But his book ultimately fails to follow Adichie's exhortation to ""engage with all of the stories"" of his students and their community.

Nicole Dixon has been teaching in the New York City public schools since 2009.

npr,,"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not",[],"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not

Is it necessary to alert listeners that theres offensive/disturbing/troubling/etc. language in a report if weve already bleeped the nettlesome word or words?

The short answer is, not always.

Previous guidance has been too strict on this point. Lets try this:

If its been decided after discussions with senior editors that a word or phrase will be bleeped, dont assume listeners do or do not need to be alerted. Instead, consider the context.

 Is the cut still intense, graphic or disturbing even after its been bleeped? Then a heads up for listeners could be warranted. By the way, it may not have to be a line that sounds like a warning. The language can be conversational and informational (more on that below).

 Is the cut funny and a naughty word or two are said in jest? Then a heads up probably isnt necessary.

 Is it one bleep in an otherwise family-friendly piece and the word wasnt said in anger? Then, again, there could be no need for a heads up.

Basically, its a judgment call. Talk to the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and/or the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott). It will get figured out.

Two related notes:

 Heres the part about being conversational and informational. If we think listeners should be alerted, we dont always need to say something like we should warn you. On Morning Edition recently, there was a piece about the comic Chris Gethard. Two F-bombs were bleeped. In the introduction, David Greene said of Gethard that, Chris is funny and weird. But he doesnt shock audiences. Youll only hear a couple of bleeps this morning. That told listeners something about Gethard and tipped them off to what was coming without saying they needed to be on guard.

 Any time theres bleeped language in a piece, the DACS line must tell stations what that word is, when it appears (or approximately if were still editing) and that it will be bleeped. Obviously, on the occasions when we dont bleep offensive language, the DACS need to explain that.

In this sense, I started with sounds, and that's what you hear in the first track ""Groundwork,"" is the beginning of me playing with sounds, trying to envision this parallel universe.

It's a concept album, and it tells the story of a hacker named MartyrLoserKing. And he lives in Burundi in Central Africa, and it's about the sort of like hacking stunts that he does that makes him a virtual phenomenon before he gets labelled as a terrorist.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

WILLIAMS: So I pulled all of that story out of the music, first. And then the first people I approached  simultaneously when I started shopping the demos to the label that I wanted to help me put it out, I started shopping the text to graphic novel companies. And so I ended up landing both deals.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: And so I'm finishing the graphic novel now and have released the first half of the music.

KELLEY: Oh, OK.

WILLIAMS: That's what this album is. There's another album coming that will come out around the time of the release of the graphic novel, which will be about a year from now.

MUHAMMAD: So you say that the  you do the music first and that's  you draw the inspiration from the sound.

WILLIAMS: Yes.

MUHAMMAD: Carving out the sound. It's a  bit of it sounds somewhat futuristic and somewhat, like, retro, but retro when retro  when, I guess, an older form of electronic music was being progressive.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: How  I'm just trying to understand how 

WILLIAMS: How do I play with that 

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, how do you play with the  yeah.

WILLIAMS:  with those both  connecting those dots? Well, yeah 

MUHAMMAD: Yes. Thank you for helping with that.

WILLIAMS: Nah. I mean, on one hand, I'm  you know, the future  the big misconception about the future is that the future is now.

MUHAMMAD: Yes.

WILLIAMS: We're always living in the future. Right now. Right? And so we can project ideas about what that sounds or looks like. And you hear those things, from Close Encounters  ""doo, doo, doo""  and all those ideas and what have you.

But the fact is that many of the ideas that we're playing with have existed for eons. Like if you look at  if you look closely at  go to a museum and look at Egyptian sculpture and hieroglyphs and what have you. The precision in that work  I don't mean what we commonly see. Like if you really go and look at that work that's 4,000, 6,000 years old, you'd be like, ""How the hell did they do this without machines?""

MUHAMMAD: Right.

WILLIAMS: ""How is that possible?"" They're drawing images that look like cartoons that are on the Cartoon Network right now. And the only thing you can say is, ""OK. Maybe they had less distraction, and so they could apply more energy to the idea."" Right? And I get the same thing musically when I listen to  what I am using sometimes in MartyrLoserKing is field recordings.

MUHAMMAD: OK.

WILLIAMS: Like so on the  there's a song called ""The Noise Came From Here"" where I use a sample from Rwanda of a group called the Twa. And the Twa are the forest people, you know, often referred to as peasants or what have you, but it's the forest people. And there's a forest song that they're singing, which we might call a work song or a field song, or what have you. But the polyrhythm is everything that we have in the idea of digital, in the idea of funk.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: What they're playing with, it's old, but if you tried to do that now, it would sound like the most modern thing ever.

It's the same thing with like  in the story of MartyrLoserKing, there is a character named Po Tolo, and Po Tolo is actually a Dogon word. The Dogon are from Mali, and they were stargazers. They actually plotted the constellation of Sirius B 

MUHAMMAD: Mm-hmm.

WILLIAMS:  hundreds of years before NASA.

In fact, the first 50 years of NASA, which is what we're up on right now, were pretty much them just confirming the stuff that the Dogon had plotted for centuries, and going, ""Yup. they're right about that too. Yup. They're right about that too. I don't know how they saw it with the naked eye. But they're right about that too.""

And the Dogon believe that  they say in their cosmology, they say that they are from Sirius. And their numerological system is binary  01010101  which has everything to do with coding.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

WILLIAMS: Right? And so that's what I'm  that's why I base the story on the continent of Africa, because we have these antiquated ideas, we have these pitiful ideas, we have these romantic ideas, surrounding the continent. But the thing we don't talk about is that, one, it's the continent where the largest number of people are connected to the Internet. Two, it's the continent  the only continent  where the majority of the public is under the age of 25. Now add those two things together. It's the future, right? And that future is now.

And if you look at the sort of innovations that's going on there  like there's a guy in Ghana who just made a 3-D printing machine out of found objects.

MUHAMMAD: What do you mean out of found objects?

WILLIAMS: Meaning out of old parts that had been thrown away.

In fact, the story of MartyrLoserKing takes place in a area that we call MartyrLoserKingdom, and it's right next to an e-waste camp. And so this is what I mean by found objects. One of the phenomenons of the continent  and other places as well  is that, of course, 80% of coltan or cobalt  the precious stone that is in our smart phones and laptops, distributes power  80% of that is found in the Congo and the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. That's where our story takes place.

And so those ships that take out the coltan are the same ships that bring in waste, e-waste. And by e-waste I mean that, of course, we replace our monitors, our computers, not when they're dead, oftentimes, but when the new thing comes out. So where do those things go? They take those things to places where scavenger culture exists, so that they can  where people will take the time to take out the copper and take out anything that's recyclable.

And so my character MartyrLoserKing actually is wandering and arrives at a place where it's miles  it's like the size of a city, but it's just piles of motherboards, monitors, and all this. But he needs shelter, and so the first part of the story is him building a house of old computer parts; other people follow suit, and so you end up with a village made of old computer parts.

MUHAMMAD: Did you spend  how much time did you spend in Africa?

WILLIAMS: In Africa? My first time in Africa was in 1994.

MUHAMMAD: OK.

WILLIAMS: My mother was an exchange teacher. I graduated from college, and my graduation gift was to spend her final month there with her. And so she was in the Gambia, and so we went to the Gambia, Senegal and Mali. That was my first trip. I was there for like a month-and-a-half.

Pretty bizarre trip, partially because there was a coup d'etat in the Gambia while we were there, and so the borders were closed. And I had a great experience, which was we had to listen to the radio to find out what we were supposed to do, cause there were all these kids running around with machine guns in the street. And they said all Americans should find safe haven at the home of the American ambassador. They gave the address.

So my mom is there with a delegation of African-American teachers; there were nine of them, and me. It was all women and me. And so we go to the house of the American ambassador, a person from the CIA. I say that because they had that thing in their ear, you know? It was a guy  the suit and the thing in the ear like, ""May I help you?"" Of course, he said ""May I help you?"" cause we're in the Gambia. And so we were African-American. We looked like other citizens there until we open our mouths.

And so we're like, ""Yeah, we're American. We heard on the radio that this is where we're supposed to come to find food and shelter."" And the guy goes, ""Oh, if I had known you guys were coming I'd have pulled the grits out the pantry."" Yeah. And then I  it was the first I ever heard my mom curse somebody out.

But, you know, that was my first trip. I got to encounter  there was a lot of things. I started writing poetry on that trip. Because, primarily, the thing that got me, as a New Yorker, was, without the intrusion of lights, the sky is amazing. The number of stars, the proximity of the moon, all the stuff I had never paid attention to. So suddenly I'm paying attention to that, and that's pretty much when I start writing.

The food, the music, the conversation, all these things were amazing. The only negative experience I had  I mean, there were things  like at that time, I remember listening to Illmatic on a train from Dakar, Senegal to Bamako, Mali. It was 37-hour ride. And I remember being up all night listening to Illmatic looking out the window.

And sometimes I'd make the mistake of standing next to other Americans who would see people holding stuff on their head, and living, you know, in like a handmade hut or something, and be like, ""Oh, look at the poverty!"" Which means that they were looking through the filter of their own experience, labelling something poverty where actually the people were self-sufficient. They were making own clothes, growing their own food.

Poverty is a construct in many ways. Because it's applied to the idea of having and have not, but we're forced to think that we should have certain things. Like, ""Oh, if you can't afford an iPhone, if you don't have this, then ""

MUHAMMAD: So is that something  I feel like that's some of the message that's in the new album, because you kind of like touch on it.

WILLIAMS: Very much so. I'm touching on all of that.

I mean, all I really wanted to do with this album is take all of the stuff I'm thinking about, all the stuff that's in the news, all the stuff that people share on social media, all the interesting finds, and kind of dump it in my drum machine and create a thinly-veiled fiction where I can talk about all the stuff that is of interest to me.

KELLEY: And it sounds  it sounds remarkably like an Octavia Butler book or Invisible Man. Like it all 

WILLIAMS: Thank you very much. That's a huge compliment. The Octavia Butler side. I mean, it's true that the idea of Afrofuturism and all that fits very well with MartyrLoserKing. There is another character in the story named Neptune Frost, who is low-key the hero of the story, and she is a modem, actually.

KELLEY: Oh, I didn't get that.

WILLIAMS: She is a modem. And  yeah, you won't get the story really from the album. Although the song ""Think Like They Book Say,"" for example, is the story of the meeting of MartyrLoserKing and Neptune Frost. You get, like, traces of  the whole story is there in the album but only in ways that I could really pick it out.

KELLEY: OK.

WILLIAMS: The graphic novel will have the full story, and the film that we're developing right now, of course, will have the full story as well. The music is just a taste of that world.

MUHAMMAD: Right. What was the motivation to bring it, the project, from the multiple facets? From the music, from the book  and are you talking theatrical or with your live performance doing something a little special with this?

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: What was the inspiration for that?

WILLIAMS: For me it was about streamlining all the stuff that are of interest to me in terms of my own creative process. For years, I've released an album here, a book of poetry there, done a movie over there, and they're all separate projects. For once, I wanted to have the album, the book, the film, the play all under the same heading: MartyrLoserKing. So just streamlining the experience of what I'm bringing to the table.

MUHAMMAD: It's wonderful.

KELLEY: Makes sense to me.

MUHAMMAD: I feel like in terms of in the past five years of just living, or receiving or consuming music and art, in such a frivolous way, I think it's enriching to have someone really give you an art that's really filling and complete.

WILLIAMS: That's the goal.

MUHAMMAD: Beyond just one piece, one part. And I don't know if many people are thinking that far or that big with it.

WILLIAMS: It's the goal. I think it's easy for us to get down on popular culture and where things are and say, ""Wow. People don't listen to albums anymore. People don't buy music anymore. People make playlists of just this song and this song and blah blah blah blah."" But I think it's really fair to say that things go in cycles, the way that Bobby Brown  you know?

MUHAMMAD: I knew you were going to go there.

WILLIAMS: You knew I was going to 

MUHAMMAD: Thank you.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. I should tell you the story of the first time I heard that album.

But anyway, things go in cycles. It's really true. And so like when Ja Rule, for example, was on top, you would've never  you'd find it hard to imagine the time period when he would not be on top. The same thing for 50. The same thing for so many people. It's hard to imagine that things go in cycle, that this thing that may be of interest to us right now will not always be of interest to us.

And for example, let's say, the reality show phenomenon.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

WILLIAMS: Which I think is like a down point in the American aesthetic in terms of taste and all that. I feel like it's  we lose something there. But I'm not foolish enough to not realize that Slam was one of the first films where people would walk away and go, ""Was that a documentary or fiction?"" There's tons of people right now who're like, ""I saw that documentary about you. You're from D.C."" I'm not from D.C. The film was shot in D.C. You know what I'm saying?

But Marc Levin, when he directed that film in the '90s, was already ahead of the curve and saying, ""This is where we're going,"" and blending reality with fiction in a way so that it's seamless. And it led up to this thing where it was like, ""I'm actually interested in reality now."" And then the thing in reality shows got to a point where it's like, ""It's not even real anymore. This thing is scripted, and this isn't what your life is like,"" and all this stuff.

And so things go in cycles. Our interest peaks and valleys, you know. And so the idea of creating an album that exists as an album, that has that richness, is something for me that's always corresponded with the level of work that I like to put into my work. It's like a painter who choses to spend 10,000 hours on a singular painting. You may look at it; it may be abstract. You're like, ""What is that?"" But somebody's going to get that and understand the amount of work that went into that.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: But yeah, we're up against things. I'll never forget years ago being on a plane with Hype Williams, and him looking me square in the face and being like, ""Yo, hip-hop is fast food. Hip-hop is fast food."" And for me, as someone that grew up rhyming and believing in hip-hop not only because of how fresh it was musically but because I saw the social change and everything connected to it, it broke my heart. It broke my heart that someone with that much power and leverage at that point in his career was looking at the art form that way. And I would say that it was reflected through some of the stuff that came out then.

MUHAMMAD: What do you think of the present state of hip-hop?

WILLIAMS: It's a lot of stuff that I love.

MUHAMMAD: Yup.

WILLIAMS: There's always been a lot of stuff that I love. Like, I love Young Thug, for example.

KELLEY: He does too.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, I love Young Thug.

KELLEY: We both do.

WILLIAMS: I mean, when I hear Young Thug and Travis Scott, for example  Travis Scott making beats. Young Thug in terms of melody and how he's approaching phrasing and what have you, like  what's that thing? ""That's my best friend. That's my best friend."" There's something beautiful there.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: I'd take that if that was like Enrique Iglesias or some s***. There's something there that's rich, even if the actual content doesn't match the quality of the presentation.

KELLEY: Yet.

WILLIAMS: Yet. It's only a matter of time. It's only a matter of time. It may not be him that does it. I mean, it's a shame that more rappers don't necessarily realize that they could make something better than a quick buck, but that's that fast food thing.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Is that when you're looking for that quick payment s***  you know, it used to be that Andy Warhol would say his thing about the 15 minutes, but artists would try to defeat that. Really, a lot of contemporary artists are looking for that 15 minutes, no more. They just want 15 minutes, enough to like pop that cherry, cash that check, buy that car. ""That's cool. I'm good."" Until they realize, ""Oh, wait.""

But it never aligns you with the people whose names we list when we say the Richard Wrights and the James Baldwins and the Octavia Butlers and the Nina Simones. You know, the people who created on a level. And me, I'm just interested in that level, because that's what always has fed me. And so that's the only way I could pay it back.

KELLEY: So I'm in the middle of writing this piece that's like  I made it a certain distance and now I'm kind of stuck. I think that the phenomenon of rappers using the word artist to describe themselves and writers using that word to describe them is relatively new, and I mean to the exclusion of almost all other terms. It's not just a synonym in, like, a two-paragraph piece.

It's like, people like, ""I'm an artist. You can call me a artist."" And now I think that it's been around for enough time that it is kind of getting in people's heads, and they're like, ""Wait, but I am an artist. And what does that mean now? Does that mean I have dispensation to act crazy? Or does that mean I can make things and not have to explain them, make things and don't think 'em through all the way so they're kind of impenetrable? And you just have to, like, take it.""

Or does it mean people feel  have too much social responsibility on them, like I feel has happened to Kendrick. Is that people put too much burden on him. I don't know. Can you help me, please?

WILLIAMS: I think that  I'm glad to see people referring to themselves as artists, and I'm glad we're at a point where you have art rock and art hop and all that stuff, you know. That's cool. Because before that, my pet peeve was around the time when Jay Z was like, ""I'm not a artist. I'm a business, man.""

And you had a lot of businessmen, the type that I grew up with, that I was finishing homework for, writing rhymes for, and what have you. A lot of drug dealers turned rappers-type s*** who didn't really have the skills of many artists that inspired them to want to do it, but who kind of infiltrated the game for the sake of business.

KELLEY: Right.

WILLIAMS: For the sake of cleaning dirty money, for the sake of making fast money, and the whole nine. And so for a minute, we had a hip-hop that was really run by  I don't mean the industry side run by businessmen  but you had rappers that identified more with being a businessman than being an artist.

KELLEY: OK.

WILLIAMS: And now it's switched. And maybe you can say, ""OK. Kanye helped with that. Cudi."" There's people that helped with that sort of idea. And I think that's wonderful that kind of switch, that you're talking about.

But what does it mean to be an artist? Well, I think it means something different for everyone else. I mean, the part of me that makes me socially responsible, for example, is not because I'm an artist. It's because I'm alive.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: And because I have a voice. And because I have children. And because I care about people. And that's me. That's me. I could still be an artist and be like, just into my thing. And it wouldn't make my art any more valid or interesting. Someone like me could still be into that person's art without them feeling the social responsibility.

I just don't understand why so many artists don't dabble in that when you can see that the great artists that we put on that list all dabbled in that. That's how they touched that pulse.

MUHAMMAD: Well, some of us as humans, we tend live life on the surface.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: And that's just the way it is, you know.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. Yeah, we do. We do.

MUHAMMAD: Not a lot of introspection. And you float through life, and that's just your purpose. And that's what it is. So 

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: And you leave an imprint, a body of work that 

WILLIAMS: It is what it is.

MUHAMMAD:  finds a way to the masses and influences people, but it's still surface. And there're others who are more than that. So it's just the way it is.

Funny thing. Just talking to my crew last night  we had a group call  and we were just reminiscing on some things and saying that funny 

WILLIAMS: Do you mean the crew?

KELLEY: I know, right? He just drops hints like that.

MUHAMMAD: The crew.

KELLEY: He's ridiculous.

MUHAMMAD: And we were reminiscing and just saying it's funny how when we were like 17, life was just about  and I will say it, cause that's what you think about when you're a young teenager  is just getting some booty and, hopefully, raising your intellect. And you can look  we look back now and go, ""OK. Somewhere we took a right turn."" A ""good turn,"" I should say.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: And we're blessed to say that. And I think our environment was supportive of that. And some people don't have a supportive environment 

WILLIAMS: Very true.

MUHAMMAD:  that will inspire them to go the depths of their  the potential of creativity and what they could tap into.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, I know 

KELLEY: And maybe the girls you were chasing were demanding more.

MUHAMMAD: Ha ha.

WILLIAMS: For me, I know the girls I were chasing are extremely  I'm trying to say 

MUHAMMAD: I'm just not going to answer that.

WILLIAMS: The girls I chased are what made my content what it is.

KELLEY: See? Thank you.

WILLIAMS: That's why my content is where it is. Those are the most lasting impressions. That's how I learned that long list of names and learned to check that out or check this out or weigh this against that and all that, is because of the type of women I was encountering who were like, ""Ah, please. This is what you like? Check this."" I can't list the number of times that happened and how many things I wouldn't be hip to if it wasn't for some woman who was like, ""Have you heard of this? You know what this is?""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, absolutely.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: I mean, to answer you, Frannie 

KELLEY: You don't have to.

MUHAMMAD:  the number one in my life, in that regard, is my mom, because she was a record collector.

WILLIAMS: Boom.

KELLEY: Right.

MUHAMMAD: And so she sent me on my way and still does, with so many things with regards to information. So, yeah, a woman's always  rules.

WILLIAMS: Exactly. Yeah. My mom was rushed from a James Brown concert to give birth to me.

KELLEY: Shut up.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: She was literally at a James Brown concert with my two older sisters, and I started kicking. And she had to leave my sisters with a security guard who was a member of my dad's church and get in an ambulance.

KELLEY: Whoa.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: So you was getting funky in the womb?

WILLIAMS: There you go.

KELLEY: He is your godfather.

MUHAMMAD: He is your godfather.

WILLIAMS: The real godfather. Yup.

i toggle caption GL Askew II for NPR GL Askew II for NPR

MUHAMMAD: So have you  speaking of a topic of hip-hop, have you done any ghostwriting for people?

WILLIAMS: The only person that I've helped write anything is Kanye.

MUHAMMAD: I knew it! It was just a thought, and I was like, ""Nah."" And I don't know if that's public knowledge or anything like that, but it was just 

WILLIAMS: It's not really. The only thing I worked on was ""Love Lockdown"" with him, on 808.

KELLEY: Ah, man.

MUHAMMAD: I knew it.

KELLEY: Ho, man.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: That is the craziest thing.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

KELLEY: That's the best thing.

MUHAMMAD: Especially listening to MartyrLoserKing and I'm like 

WILLIAMS: ""This is the album he wants to make.""

KELLEY: Wooo!

MUHAMMAD: Well, I didn't think that. But I actually did think  after listening to this album, I was like, ""Wow, Kanye really "" I just hear the influence, and it wasn't  I never realized that until listening to your new album. I'm like, ""Wow, that's "" I mean, nothing from Kanye cause he's really  I'm a fan of his work.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

MUHAMMAD: But just to see that influence, or hear it, and just wondering had you been approached by other people to do some writing for 

WILLIAMS: Not other people. Kanye is the only that approached me on that level, on many levels. When I was working on Niggy Tardust, he came to a show. And he had ten people on stage at that time. We had four. And he came back and was full of questions like, ""How come you have less people on stage than me, and have such a bigger sound? What are you using?""

And so he started flying my MPC guy, CX Kidtronik, out to Hawaii at the time and trying to find stuff out. And then he met with me and Trent to ask about lights, like, ""What type of lighting rig are you using? What is this?"" And so, yeah, he is someone who's been interested. Aside from that, there have not been other rappers that I have written for, not since I was a teenager in school.

MUHAMMAD: Alright, well, he's a big one, so. But, nah, I just think that the level of writing, the content and the depths are something that a lot of people could benefit from. Not necessarily looking for a shortcut, though, I mean in terms of just looking for a mentor to really usher the level of artistry to a higher state.

WILLIAMS: I know when I first started having money to go to concerts, the first thing I tried to do is try to bring gifts for rappers.

Like I had  I remember someone hooked me up with free tickets to check out The Roots and Common. And I had two copies of  what's his name? Hazrat Inayat Khan, The Mysticism Of Sound. And I had heard something in Black Thought's lyrics and something in Common's lyrics; I was like, ""Ah, they're interested in sound vibration and all this type of stuff."" I had just finished the book and was like, ""This would be interesting for them.""

And so the first time I encountered those rappers, I was like, ""This is a gift for you."" I was that nerdy guy backstage with a book, like, ""I have a gift for my favorite artists""-type thing, even though those weren't necessarily my favorite artists, right. Although Black Thought has gone up tremendously.

KELLEY: Mm-hmm.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, he's  I mean, this is what I want to say, which is unrelated, but I'm here with you, and we mentioned Black Thought. And Tip is another person who makes me think of this. I have the philosophy that rappers, in fact, should age amazingly, that they get more and more graceful, more and more innovative, more and more amazing with time.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: That ageism has no place in hip-hop, that you're  I mean, KRS-One is a good example of that, too.

MUHAMMAD: Yup.

WILLIAMS: You know, who's like, ""I can keep up with the best of them, actually. You may tire of listening to me, but ""

MUHAMMAD: I think for a moment in time, that concept was foreign to hip-hop, to embrace that idea or to even embrace artists who have been around for a long time and to think that they have any value. And it's  I think  but right now, that's changing because you can call someone old but so many times, and it's like, ""OK. You done trying to hurt my feelings. Can we really ""

WILLIAMS: Yeah. ""Can we get into this?""

MUHAMMAD: ""Can we get into it? And now I'm laying it out, and now you gotta go back to the drawing board, cause ""

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: And so I feel like  I agree with you completely.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's  I mean, if you were to look at the evolution of someone like Monk or someone like Max Roach, it's not like, ""Oh, Max is old."" I mean, Max was drumming on a level that got better and better, more and more intricate, maybe their  the thing that they're interested in may get more abstract. Or you look at producers, people like Brian Eno or what have you. The stuff  look at  listen to David Bowie's last album.

MUHAMMAD: I have not yet.

WILLIAMS: Yo. I had the weirdest experience that night. The weirdest experience. Which is that I was at my kitchen table, writing, checking on some email stuff, and a friend of mine posted something about the David Bowie album. I'd already listened, and I was like, ""Ah, I'm going to listen. I didn't have any music on, but I'ma to turn that on again. I want to check that out.""

So I'm listening to the David Bowie album. I listened to it twice, and it's because of this one song that I love, which is called ""Girls Love Me."" And the chorus is, ""Where the f*** did Monday go?"" And so I play that one like four times in a row. ""Where the f*** did Monday go?"" And then I start listening to Diamond Dogs, and while I'm listening to Diamond Dogs, my wife comes downstairs crying like, ""Did you hear the news?""

KELLEY: Oh my god.

WILLIAMS: It was crazy. And so then I'm like, ""Did you hear this song? Cause it's Sunday night."" And it was like, ""Where the f*** did Monday go?"" Surreal.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: Surreal.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: But, yeah, I think these cats age  I mean, Leonard Cohen. Leonard Cohen I think writes more and more beautiful and simple songs and just saying  just graceful. Like, ""Ah, this is all it takes, actually.""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: Right.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: Hopefully, people will be inspired  and not only inspired but just have the surroundings to do so. Cause, you know, hip-hop is 

WILLIAMS: The support. Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. There's so much from the infrastructure level that doesn't really support artists to want to continue to create after five years of doing it. Life happens. But I'm interested in that you say that, to know what Rakim would do like in another ten years. Yeah.

WILLIAMS: OK. I love  I mean, the other side of that story  and this is going to  this is the craziest thing for me to say, especially since we're on air. And I just met Rakim, and I love Rakim. I think that it's  I mean, Rakim is very much responsible for the person that I am, you know what I'm saying? Like many of us, like, whoa. It's surreal the level of impact.

There has to be something that is said for the artist who stays on their creative path, that does not swallow the hype or what have you, but keeps on forming challenges for themselves to keep going. And that's funny, because we have no doubt about that in painting, for example.

KELLEY: Right.

WILLIAMS: A painter gets older and older, and they follow their path. And we know  like, ""Have you seen what they're doing now?"" Sculptors: ""Have you seen what they're doing now?"" Some filmmakers, not every filmmaker, you know? It really does  some filmmakers get really better and better. Tarkovsky is a great one.

On the other hand, like, I'm hesitant to diss popular names, but there are some established great filmmakers who have films that are out now or have been out recently that don't hold up, because people do other things. They surrender to fear. One of the ways people surrender to fear is, like, rehab. I mean, like, ""Get high, n****."" No. What I'm trying to say is that  no.

KELLEY: So glad you said that on this show.

WILLIAMS: No, but it's true. It's true that there's some artists that I really wish they kept drinking or whatever the hell they did, because when they started  when they replaced that thing with god and their idea of this submission and all that, their work became a reflection of their fears and weak  nobody's going to say this so I'm going to say it. I'll catch hell for this.

MUHAMMAD: OK.

WILLIAMS: Alright. I'll catch hell for this. That's fine.

KELLEY: OK.

WILLIAMS: But I'm sorry. There are artists who  they reach that point, and instead of like  I mean, basically, I'm saying I don't like quitters.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: They reach that point, and it's a point of fear. I've seen it happen to many artists who become frightened by success  alright  and it's the same way you can get frightened by taking too much of something or whatever. And suddenly you become ultra-religious, right?

And there's nothing wrong with the idea of spirituality, but the idea of religion has to do with this other sort of submission. You submit this thing, and you start aligning the work with, you know, with this other idea. I'm being abstract cause I don't want to diss anybody, but I guess I'll just say that 

MUHAMMAD: You could stay abstract. It's cool.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to 

KELLEY: You always want people to stay abstract.

MUHAMMAD: You know why? Because people have families.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, exactly.

KELLEY: OK. OK. I understand that.

WILLIAMS: Exactly. There you go.

KELLEY: I respect that of course.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. It's just that simple.

WILLIAMS: And I'm not trying to 

KELLEY: Maybe I could ask 

MUHAMMAD: You could be hearing like, you know, we can just pop and blow up and give it all.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: But then like, you just  it depends on the individual 

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD:  which is why some people don't have those sort of 

KELLEY: Yeah, I know. I get that. Then maybe I can ask some question to help clarify for people 

WILLIAMS: Go ahead.

KELLEY:  who don't know who you guys are talking about. So would you prefer  are you asking that people evolve or that people stay within?

WILLIAMS: I'm asking that people evolve. You mentioned Octavia Butler earlier, right?

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: She has this book called Imago. And in this book  it's a really interesting idea that's in this book. In this book, it's the future, and humans, like our shape has evolved. We have more than one arm  we have more than two arms. We have extra limbs and antennas growing out of our head and all this stuff.

And at one point, it's explained how it happened. And what she explains is for that 100 years, we thought that we  that in fact, we thought that the answer to cancer was burning it out, chemotherapy and all this stuff, and in fact cancer was our body attempting to evolve with the environment and the times. And because we would try to burn it out, it would kill us. If we had watered our cancer, then our organism would've evolved. And so in fact, this whole new humanity came from us learning that we needed to water our cancer instead of burning it away.

KELLEY: So does that then apply to people's fears?

WILLIAMS: Yes. You should face your fears.

It's like people who smoke weed and say, ""Weed makes me paranoid."" Like, weed doesn't make you paranoid. You're paranoid. You're paranoid. You're grounded in fear. You have all these fears running around you. Weed is showing you that it's there. If you want to enjoy your high, why don't you spend the time not high addressing those fears, so that when you get high, you can actually get high and not just encounter the fears that you allow to run around your head all the time without properly addressing them and annihilating them.

MUHAMMAD: Absolutely.

WILLIAMS: How about that?

KELLEY: Co-sign.

MUHAMMAD: I agree with that. Well, and I just take  nevermind. The same thing. Same thing.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, but that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Is that we have to find the courage to approach things, to step beyond our comfort zones at times. And I believe that there are some artists that do that and go further and go further, and they get more and more wild. Like Oliver Stone, whose first film was Conan The Barbarian, went from being that guy to Natural Born Killers to now this thing on Edward Snowden. He's gotten more courageous, rebellious, revolutionary in his work as time has progressed. OK?

That's what I'm talking about. Same thing with Leonard Cohen. We were talking  I'm talking about an artist who's like, ""You know what? I ain't got nothing to lose. I'm gonna go further out."" You have other people who's like, ""You know what? I miss that old school, man. I miss that duh-duh-duh."" And that's a choice. That's an idea too. But you can go further and further out. Bowie's a great example of someone who was like, ""OK. Let's go further and further out.""

KELLEY: I mean also there's this  like the idea of hip-hop as youth culture. There's been this idea, especially from, I think, the corporate side, that's like: don't  you don't know  you hit 40 and you've lost touch. You don't know what the kids want. You don't know what's going to move, and you need to get out of the way.

WILLIAMS: Look at Miles Davis' B****** Brew.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Look at  there's tons of artists. Maya Angelou never wrote a book until she was 42.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: You know what I'm saying? There's so many artists whose great moments occurred well after what we would allot as, ""This is prime-time,"" you know?

KELLEY: In rap, there hadn't been models, because it's so young, generationally-speaking. You guys are doing it.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, exactly. That's the thing. The only other model is the other forms of music. But I mean, you can't tell me that Andre 3000 is not getting fresher, just like you can't tell me that Tip is not getting fresher.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: These guys are getting fresher with time. They're actually getting fresher with time. I've witnessed it. I'm like, ""Oh my god."" The sort of grace and understanding that these guys have with music and their ability to listen and to understand where words can go and how they fit and how they flow and how they fly and all that stuff, it's enhanced. So that you have someone like Kendrick, who is coming at it as a young kid, encountering  being allowed glimpses of how these things can happen.

That's what I see it as, even for stuff that I wrote I was younger. I was like, ""I'm being allowed glimpses of this stuff."" But now is my turn to earn it. To take it further, to keep on growing. What can I write that I understood where this came from that I wrote when I was 22? And now how do I keep on evolving that? And it's through what you're reading and who you're surrounded by and the conversations you have and what you're listening to and going further and further and further and further and further, you know?

Imagine  I mean, you make amazing music that comes from listening. You're a crate digger. Your mom, like you said, had collected records.

MUHAMMAD: Yup.

WILLIAMS: And at what point did the people around you start going, ""Yo, play that again,"" and started preferring maybe to hear the older version more than they were into like 

MUHAMMAD: Absolutely. And even now, where I'm at now 

WILLIAMS: Exactly. Where you're at now.

MUHAMMAD:  just transitioning from Brooklyn to Los Angeles cause this is where I needed to be 

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD:  for my level of writing and creative levels. It's taken on another plateau that I'm excited about. But I never stop listening. I'm always open to receiving that information. It's similar to what you were saying, just the experience in Africa and talking about some of the other cultures. These things have been around for thousands of years; it's just we  I don't know. We didn't channel it until whenever we channel it.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. Exactly.

MUHAMMAD: So which is the now? The future of what's happening right now.

WILLIAMS: And so you take that in, you listen, and it keeps you growing.

MUHAMMAD: Can I go back a moment just to the story a little bit? Why Burundi?

WILLIAMS: Well, my wife is from Rwanda.

MUHAMMAD: OK.

WILLIAMS: And I love listening to stories of that region and what have you. It's filled with horrendous stories and horrendous realities. One of the positive things I was able to take away from one of the stories I heard was how Burundi, specifically the capital Bujumbura, was a destination for many people in Central Africa, like we might dream of Paris. Like, ""One day I'm going to go to Bujumbura. I hear the women in Bujumbura, the music in Bujumbura, the food in Bujumbura "" so I started imagining the idea of this place as a destination.

Also because Burundi has a very specific  has had a very specific effect on music. There is an album recorded in the '60s called Les Tambours Du Burundi, the drums of Burundi, which Johnny Rotten got his hands on and played for Adam Ant. And the rhythms from Burundi in fact laid the foundation of new wave.

KELLEY: Wow.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

WILLIAMS: The whole new wave sound comes from Les Tambours Du Burundi. The rhythm section.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

KELLEY: That's really cool.

WILLIAMS: And those types of stories are of course of interest to me. And so 

MUHAMMAD: That's  information is enriching, man.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. So for a few reasons.

Also because I'm from a place called Newburgh, New York. And it's about 16 miles from New York City with 30,000 people. And for the past 40 years, Newburgh has had the highest murder rate, crime rate, drug trafficking rate in New York state. It's the most violent place in New York state, more violent than any place in New York City. But most people never heard of Newburgh.

And I relate that to the idea of Burundi because we know  like if I say Rwanda, I know the first thing  ""Oh!"" I know what you going to say. If I say the Congo, you've heard of the Congo, but most people haven't heard of Burundi. It's like that Robin [Harris]  what was that? ""The man sitting next to the man!"" The idea of this place you haven't heard of. It kind of liberates the imagination.

Part of MartyrLoserKing was inspired by when I was listening to M.I.A.'s album back in the day, and I loved the line where she was like, ""I put people on a map that never seen a map."" And that was part of the spark of like, ""Ah, I'm going to focus on Burundi.""

Ironically, focusing on Burundi has been interesting because, right at the time I started mixing and mastering this album, conflicts in Burundi have arisen. And they're ongoing right now as their president Nkurunziza has basically changed their constitution and put himself in for a third term. And so protestors have been in the streets. Hundreds of people have been killed. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country for fear of violence and what have you.

And the instability in that region is totally related to the history of instabilities in that region, meaning what we know of Rwanda, what we know of Uganda, what we know of Tanzania, Congo and all that. It's all  it's the same people actually, as in their neighbor Rwanda.

So it's a frightening time for Burundians right now, and so it's crazy that I ended up writing a song about protestors in Burundi before the conflict happened in my imagined story. And by the time that song was released, or is released, it's simultaneous with what's happening in Burundi.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, I actually thought it was specific to it, which is why I asked you about it. But that's heavy.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. Yeah.

KELLEY: Can I ask you about a line on ""No Different?"" When you say, ""Too selfish to be free,"" what do you mean by that?

WILLIAMS: Oh. I mean we're self-consumed individually and as a nation oftentimes. We're self-consumed. We believe that we're the center of the world and what we're about is the center of the world. You know how much we miss out on just in musical innovation because we only listen to music that's in English?

MUHAMMAD: Oh, yeah.

WILLIAMS: You know how much we miss out on in terms of film because we think Hollywood is the place creating the best movies in the world? Like, are you checking the movies out of Russia? Are you checking the movies out of Poland? Out of Romania? Out of Senegal? Out of Cote d'Ivoir? Out of South Africa? There's a bunch of stuff that doesn't work in our industry that's working in the rest of the world, actually. You know what I'm saying?

MUHAMMAD: Mm-hmm.

WILLIAMS: And we're self-consumed enough to think that we're operating from this plateau of freedom and all this stuff, and from the outside looking in, it's always really obvious and clear examples of the freedoms we don't realize that we're missing, you know? We think we live in the freest country in the world but that's just a motto. That's just a motto.

There are places where there are  you know, it's not to say that the idea of democracy is not evolving and struggling to evolve in all places around the world, but it is to say that in a cultural sense we're too self-consumed to really express the greatest freedoms in the world. Because there's a lot of times when you think you're expressing something without realizing what it imposes on another, and how it imposes on another.

And then individually  because that song, ""No Different,"" is really a personal thing. It's really about that in the microcosm, in the microcosmic sense. In the same way that I can say all that I want about what I understand about the world and blah blah blah blah, but it doesn't make me any different. I'm an artist with kids who often time is too self-consumed to pay the right amount of attention to something, too concerned with how I'm gonna finish this or how I'm gonna pay for that or how I'm gonna do that to give the proper attention to this or that. Or to enjoy a moment because I'm stressing out about the thing that's coming up tomorrow and what have you.

So it's also about the simplicity of that. And that's what I'm talking about in that song, is, ""I see that in you, just like I see it in me. You're no different from the way I am."" You're no different from the way I am. We're both in this, and it's always a dance that we're doing of like, ""Wait a second. Why am I sitting here stressed out? I'm in the room with the most beautiful person I know. And why am I not enjoying this? Why am I stressed about who I have to go see after this? Why aren't I living in the moment?"" You know, all those things.

So that's where that idea comes from.

KELLEY: Thanks for explaining that.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: So, it seems like you're restless.

WILLIAMS: Hm?

MUHAMMAD: Seems like you're restless.

WILLIAMS: You think so?

MUHAMMAD: I don't know. You're 

WILLIAMS: I mean, I'm restless in the sense that like  I have a lot of energy. That's true. And I have the support of friends and industry at times, or in certain ways, or to a certain extent. But I always feel like there's a lot more I could do with a little more support. And so I'm  if I'm restless, it's because  like, for example right now I'm working to fund this film that I want to direct.

And I have a pretty cool background, in terms of film and stuff that I've been able to write and get out there and all of that. It's a weird but interesting background, but it's still difficult, as you know 

MUHAMMAD: Yes.

WILLIAMS:  to garner the support that we need. And walking around with the mantle of a poet or ""deep"" or any of these things isn't always helpful. It's full of respect and critical acclaim, but there's also these categorical boxes that you belong in. Like for that moment  ""Well, we're trying to have a party right now. We're not gonna put this album on.""

MUHAMMAD: Right.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: And I'm like, ""Actually, this is for the party.""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, I was thinking that.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, this is for the party, actually. But people place ideas and people and certain forms of expression in boxes. I'm dealing with a very periphery art form, poetry. This is part of the reason why I'm dealing with graphic novels and music, because the infrastructure will allow that much more than they will allow poetry. A graphic novel has much more chance than a book of poems.

Even though I can sneak  you know, and I was like, oh, wow, a graphic novel, I can sneak in  that can just be the graffiti on the wall, the backdrop in a panel where two characters are talking. But like the brand of  what's written on the T-shirt, the brand of the sneaker, the graffiti on the wall, the poems are everywhere. So I'm forced to maneuver.

So it's not that I'm restless. It's that I'm hustling. I'm hustling, b.

MUHAMMAD: I got you.

WILLIAMS: Hustling poems. I'm hustling amethyst rocks, you know what I'm saying?

MUHAMMAD: Well, we appreciate it, and I mean, I totally understand the challenge. I was gonna say struggle, cause it's not a struggle. It's just a challenge.

WILLIAMS: No. It's just a challenge.

MUHAMMAD: It's a challenge. And I totally identify with it. And if anything for someone who has such a brilliant mind, and I think a great  I'll say teacher, in a sense.

WILLIAMS: Thank you.

MUHAMMAD: Cause your music and your poetry definitely, even this conversation is like a professor. And so 

WILLIAMS: But they ain't offering me no professorships.

MUHAMMAD: But you know what though? But that's the challenge, and I think you've  like for an example, as you explained with putting together this graphic piece, it's just figuring out the formula to do what you need to do how you want to do it. And it's no different to what other corporations are so really great at, in figuring out a formula to help push their product.

WILLIAMS: Exactly.

MUHAMMAD: I know you wanted to ask about Holler If Ya Hear Me?

KELLEY: Oh, yeah. I mean, I have several more questions. First of all, if you could just say on our air what Holler If Ya Hear Me was, because everybody thought it was a Tupac biopic. And it's their fault and it's journalism's fault.

WILLIAMS: Sure. Holler If Ya Hear Me  I'll tell you something you don't know and what most people don't know  was conceptualized by August Wilson, and August Wilson began working on Holler If Ya Hear Me with Afeni Shakur before he died. The great playwright August Wilson. And his assistant took over the job after he died, and worked with Kenny Leon in bringing this play to life.

And what this play is and what August Wilson was working on and Todd took over was taking all of Tupac's lyrics and concocting a story, restricting yourself only to the characters that he mentioned in songs and to lyrics that he said, or used in songs. So just it's like if I say, ""OK. I want you to write a story, but I'm gonna give you a book and every word you use has to come from this book."" And so that's what it was. ""Brenda's Got A Baby."" So, OK, there's a character named Brenda. OK. And she has a baby. So you're just playing with all these ideas.

But no, Pac is not in the story. It was a story of a guy who gets out of prison and is trying to make a change in his life, but gets caught up, you know, out there. And right at the moment where you think that, oh, s***, he's about to get caught back up in the old thing that he was, he finds, re-finds, the courage and the wisdom that he encountered while he was in prison, and instead ends up changing the community by the decision that he makes in that moment of crisis.

And so it's about that. It was a musical. It was on Broadway. It was produced by Eric Gold, and it was directed by Kenny Leon, and it was extraordinary. It was an extraordinary experience for me, primarily because my background is 

KELLEY: And you starred in it.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, I starred in it. And my background is evenly tiered between hip-hop and theater. I started both the same time, when I was eight years old. I heard T La Rock, ""It's Yours,"" and I took a class at my school called Shake Hands With Shakespeare and got cast as Marc Antony in Julius Caesar. Same year. And so by the end of that year, I was trying to write rhymes in old English.

KELLEY: Yeah, this very neatly brings me to my follow-up, which is: what are your observations and feelings about Hamilton?

WILLIAMS: Ah, man. I haven't 

KELLEY: And its success, its reception.

WILLIAMS: Ah, I think it's wonderful. I think it's wonderful. I actually have not seen Hamilton.

KELLEY: OK.

WILLIAMS: Except for I saw Lin-Manuel perform  we were both invited to the White House in 2009, and he performed what he was working on then, which was a few monologues from Hamilton.

KELLEY: Right.

WILLIAMS: And it was extraordinary. He is extraordinary. So I think it's amazing. I think it's amazing what he's doing.

If I were to make any parallels or connection between what's happening in Hamilton versus what happened with Holler If Ya Hear in terms of the hip-hop musical on Broadway, I would say that, you know, our story was about gun violence happening in the Midwest, right? We finished the play the week before Michael Brown was killed. And that's what the play was about. That's what happens in the play. That's what the play was about.

People coming to Broadway were choosing between Rocky The Musical, Kinky Boots and that. And even the people at the ticket booths out there were like, ""Yeah, it's a great play. It's a bit of a downer."" Cause people would leave crying, like when Sarafina! was on Broadway. People would leave crying. Madonna's in the front row, crying. Harry Belafonte's there, crying. Whoopi Goldberg's there, crying. Anybody who came would be.

And so we're at a point in the thing in our relationship to art in this country where we really have aligned it with escape.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: And if you're dealing with a play about gun violence in the Midwest right at a time where it's really going down, stop-and-frisk, and all those things that were happening in New York right at the point when the play was going on. That play did not provide the escape. What it provided was insight, revolutionary insight, into what was going down. But nah, there was no escape in that play.

Like, the play began with me coming down from the top of the theater in a jail cell. Coming down over the audience, in a jail cell, going, ""They got a n**** shedding tears."" It was too hardcore for Broadway. It was basically just too hardcore.

Hamilton is fun, innovative, a refreshing look at history and diversity and duh duh duh duh duh. Like, that's its brilliance. That's its brilliance. But this was more like Do The Right Thing. You could leave the production of Holler If Ya Hear Me and holler at somebody, for real. Like, people were screaming. The last show we did, people were upset in the aisles like, ""This is what we need! This is what America needs. They don't need to close it."" People were going crazy. People were going crazy.

And it's that. Like, nah, it was touching on the pulse of something. And so that's story behind it. No, there was no Tupac character in that play. It was the spirit of Tupac. And that's why his mother who was a producer on the play was there like, ""Tonight, revolution is happening on this stage."" It's the same thing Harry Belafonte said to me when he came to see the play, more than once. And he was like, ""Yo, you got a hard job here, dude. Cause you're taking something that is very politically poignant, and you're placing it in a Eurocentric context,"" meaning the Great White Way. He's like, ""Phew. Wow."" No, that thing was powerful.

KELLEY: So, as somebody who  and I would like to tip my hat to Rob Kenner for this question, Rob Kenner of Mass Appeal  so, as somebody who  so Slam. Slam is based on the life of Bonz Malone who's writing while in Rikers part of the time, learning while he's locked up. How did that role affect your relationship to writing around hip-hop, hip-hop culture, black culture?

WILLIAMS: Well, I was already writing around that stuff way before that happened.

KELLEY: I'm trying to get your perspective on rap journalism over the past  I don't know  20 years, really.

WILLIAMS: Ah.

KELLEY: So maybe that's a simpler way to just ask.

WILLIAMS: Hmm. On rap journalism. Well, I've always been a fan of many a rap journalist and the time they take to digest and critique. I think of someone like Chuck Creekmur. I think of the old school heads like Greg Tate or Nelson George, dream hampton, even Kevin Powell. There were some great people that were really dissecting the culture and introducing it to the public in intellectually clarifying ways. I thought it was really fresh over the years.

In terms of where it's gone, I have no idea. I may have reached a point where I don't  it's rare for me to read too many articles on an artist more so than just listening to an album and making my own decision.

KELLEY: It's really upsetting to me that that work is not useful to you.

WILLIAMS: No, I think the work  it's hard to say. I mean, for example, I was excited about Medium and Cuepoint.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Because, for once, I felt like the writers were allowed to write about what they want to write about.

KELLEY: Sure.

WILLIAMS: Because there's also been this sense of  I don't know what to call it. I want to just call it d***riding, where 

KELLEY: That's what it's called.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. Where you got the sense that people writing for certain magazines were not allowed to be disinterested in certain things, that they weren't allowed to give a real critique, that they had to just  it's this populism, this thing of just like 

KELLEY: Chasing page views.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. And chasing clicks, and at the same time, just applauding this thing that everybody else is applauding, saying, ""Hey, look! We're applauding it too.""

And so it depends. I mean, it's reflected through every art form  and I include the rap journalism in the art form category  of places where it's like, I love the voices that don't conform. I love the voices that are really weighing context and the history of writing criticism and all this stuff. I think it's awesome, but I can't say that I read a lot of stuff  also because I'm sensitive, and so I dodge it for myself and then I dodge it for others, too, sometimes.

KELLEY: Yeah, totally.

WILLIAMS: But I think it's crucial. I think it's really important at the same time. And that's that. I don't know what else to say about that.

I think a Bonz, for example, Bonz is an amazing character. Bonz is quite the character, and has always been that dude who's had such amazing insight and a foot in so many worlds simultaneously. And it's rare for someone to have that sort of access and street credibility, simultaneously. It's wild. Bonz is an inspiration of mine.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. People ask me, ""How is it that you can talk about these issues?"" And like I said  my response is oftentimes, ""How can you not?""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: I don't know how much I could write about cars and girls. I'm just not certain how much I could do that. I take drugs. I don't know how much I'm gonna write about it, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm just not  I don't know. I don't get it, other than, OK, that's what sells.

So those things are cool, but I understand  I know the second, the first time you mention, you know, popping a molly in your article, you're doing that for  to give this sense of credibility, of like, ""Yo, I'm just like you. I'm a regular dude. I'm into the same stuff as you. You should check me out because I'm just like you, man. I'm not pushing it in any major way. I'm doing the same sort of stuff you're trying to do. I'm trying to get a VIP pass. I had taken a few pills."" That's that article, right?

KELLEY: Yeah, yeah.

WILLIAMS: ""I had taken a few pills. I was feeling good. Duh duh duh duh duh. Duh duh duh duh duh."" So I applaud that sort of sensibility at times, not when it's overdone.

KELLEY: Understood.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. But I can see it for what it is. I can see  I mean, I use the same thing sometimes when I'm writing. You know, that this is a moment  this a great moment for me to say something that will be a reference. I mean, I could do it in an interview, right? I can reference Young Thug, so that people who like Young Thug could go, ""Oh, OK. He likes some of the stuff that I do like as well."" We all play these games, especially if you're writing. You're aware 

KELLEY: You've been talking about Young Thug for like two years in interviews, so 

WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I'm sincerely into all that stuff.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: For me it started with Project Pat, when I was  because I was in New York surrounded by  well, I really wasn't in New York, but I was hanging out with a lot of New Yorkers who were, you know, restricted to  and I'm guilty of it, being restricted to liking the stuff where the content spoke to what they understood.

So New York cats were like, ""Southern cats aren't even saying nothing."" And for me it was like, ""It's not what they're saying; it's how they're saying it.""

MUHAMMAD: How. Yup.

WILLIAMS: Do you hear the way he's approaching this beat, dude? Do you hear the way  that's what's interesting. Forget  and I'm a victim of that.

I'll tell you the worst story of my life, which I've told before. But it's like one of the saddest moments for me, is when I was doing my first album, with Rick Rubin, and he sent me a bunch of DJ Screw mixtapes. DJ Screw was still alive. This is in 1999. And he's like, ""Yo, this is what I think we should do."" For Amethyst Rock Star.

And I put on the mixtapes, and all I heard was the content. And I had just signed to a major, and I had the all this pent up fear of like, ""They're gonna try and change me."" And so I heard the content and I was like, ""Ah, there you go. They're trying to change me."" And I didn't even realize that he wasn't talking about emulating the words that were being said. It was the style.

MUHAMMAD: Sound.

WILLIAMS: The chopped-and-screwed style.

KELLEY: Wow.

WILLIAMS: And I was like, ""Nah nah nah, b."" And I regret that, big time. He wanted to set me up to go in the studio with DJ Screw.

KELLEY: We would all be in a very different place if that had happened.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. So that's how I f***** up the world. Actually. We had to wait for like, ""Mike Jones!""

MUHAMMAD: And there goes the answer to: so is there anything, lasting impression, that you've experienced that you want to leave with the kids to help give them some direction? I think that's it right there. You know, just to be 

WILLIAMS: Literature.

MUHAMMAD: Literature.

WILLIAMS: Literature. All I can say is this. Watch  over the course of year, make sure you watch at least four films that were not shot in English. Alright? Read  OK  let's say two books off of the top-seller list or something. That's fine. And then let's say, three or four more that you encounter from someone telling you about or what have you. And go through the genres. Like if you're into self-help books, that's fine. Do one or two. But try something in fiction. Find the fiction that speaks to you. Find the autobiography that speaks to you.

Like, there's something so rich and enriching from literature. Because then, you know, you also can figure out when you're actually innovating. There's so many times when you think you're innovating something, and literature's just a great example of that.

I can go back to the Rick Rubin thing, where I first started getting into like wanting to make punk music and picking up a guitar and stuff on my first album. And I'd be like, ""Come to the house. I got this demo you gotta hear, yo. Come."" He'd come by and he'd be like, ""This sounds like you never listened to Rush or Black Sabbath, so you think you're doing something fresh, but anybody who listened to Rush or Black Sabbath ain't gonna be impressed."" And I'm thankful for that type of hardcore 

KELLEY: I just liked your impression.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. You know? And so I thought I was innovating, but that was because I wasn't really checking on the references. I wasn't doing the homework.

MUHAMMAD: Mm-hmm.

WILLIAMS: And so I had to go and do the homework. Find out what he was referencing. And then talk to other people. Play it with other people who were like, ""Yo, have you checked this?"" Before I know it, I'm backstage with The Mars Volta listening to CAN. Like, ""Holy crap, prog rock. Holy crap. This is crazy."" You know what I'm saying? And then just getting deeper and deeper into that stuff, so that then when it's time to make music again, I'm applying the stuff that now comes as an expression of the work that's been done, the research that's been done.

Anyway, I think literature is a really beautiful thing to have in your life. My son is 15 years old, and for the past six months, he's been reading everything by Kurt Vonnegut, Murakami, James Baldwin, Robert Heinlein, Patti Smith. He read Just Kids and just now  and Ta-Nehisi Coates. He's been  and it all started when I punished him. I punished him with a book, which was really smart.

KELLEY: What book?

WILLIAMS: Ta-Nehisi Coates. Cause he was 14 at the time, and he got in trouble. I won't say what it was, but he got in trouble. And I was like, ""Ah, this dude said he wrote this book for his 14-year-old son."" I was like, ""You gonna sit in this room, you're gonna read this book, and you're going to write me a paragraph about each chapter."" You know?

MUHAMMAD: Nice.

WILLIAMS: And at first, he started it off like, ""You think his son read this book? His son didn't read this book.""

KELLEY: Halfway through he's like, ""My son didn't read this book.""

WILLIAMS: And then halfway through, he's like, ""It's pretty interesting.""

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: He goes, ""It's not as fun as Monster."" He had read Monster Kody.

KELLEY: Yeah. Of course.

WILLIAMS: So he was like, ""It's not as fun as Monster, but it's cool. It's interesting."" And then he started getting more and more into it.

WILLIAMS: And then he was like, ""Can you recommend something funny?"" ""Kurt Vonnegut."" ""OK.""

MUHAMMAD: Nice.

WILLIAMS: It keeps on going.

KELLEY: Do your homework, kids.

WILLIAMS: Do your homework. Nah, we're telling you to check that out for a reason. There's amazing worlds to be discovered that will affect your approach to the world.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Big time. You know? That's all I am a reflection of, is the conversations I've had, the music I've listened to, the books I've read, the movies I've watched, which led me to new conversations, which led me to new references.

MUHAMMAD: Mm-hmm.

KELLEY: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: People being like, ""What? You never checked this out before?"" And then the next interview, I'm spewing out that name as if I've been checking it out for years, but I just discovered that fool last week. It's an ongoing thing. But then that makes somebody else come up to me like, ""I heard that interview where you said you like that. You should check this."" And before you know it I'm in like Russian literature from the 1300s. Like, ""Oh, OK.""

KELLEY: Yeah. It's the best.

WILLIAMS: Not necessarily that, but.

MUHAMMAD: That's what's up.

KELLEY: Word. Thank you for giving us so much of your time.

MUHAMMAD: Yes.

WILLIAMS: It's a pleasure to be here with you guys. It's a pleasant surprise to see these beautiful faces, and thank you for having me.

MUHAMMAD: Oh, thank you so much.

WHAT, you might ask, is Anna Karenina doing on the same summer reading list as The Little Engine That Could?

Let me explain.

In previous summers, we gave you lists and lists and lists of new books organized by genre. And that was fun. But this summer we wanted to try something different.

Back in December, when we worked on the year-end 2013 Best Books Concierge, one of the things we enjoyed most was finding common threads in very different books (just look at the unlikely titles that live together under the ""Funny Stuff"" category, or the ""Family Matters"" category). And that's how we ended up settling on this year's Book Your Trip project  a series that is much more about the journey than the destination, and aims to create a surprising, serendipitous book discovery experience for the summer months.

In March, the NPR Books team  Petra Mayer, Nicole Cohen, Rose Friedman and myself  reached out to our trusted reviewers, librarians and Arts Desk colleagues and asked them to brainstorm books that featured themes or memorable scenes of transportation and transit. As usual, they wrote back with hundreds of titles  both old and new. We spent the next month or so sorting those books  recommended by Lynn Neary, Michele Norris, Nancy Pearl, Maureen Corrigan, Neda Ulaby and many more. (You can hear Petra talk more about that process with Linda Wertheimer in the audio at the top of this page.)

Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call 'time' a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in 'The Incredible Journey' qualify for the 'by foot' list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with 'James and the Giant Peach'? (Create a big 'miscellaneous' list, obviously.)

There were some pretty straightforward categories  train, plane, bike, boat ... but it didn't take long for things to get squirrelly. Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call ""time"" a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in The Incredible Journey qualify for the ""by foot"" list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with James and the Giant Peach? (Create a big ""miscellaneous"" list, obviously.)

It wasn't always pretty, but eventually we settled on 12 lists: train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time and a miscellaneous category that includes drugs, dragons and giant peaches. (A moment of silence here for a fun list called ""Connections"" that included books featuring multiple modes of transit  like Nellie Bly's Around the World in Seventy-Two Days. Things were just getting too unwieldy, and it didn't make the cut.)

Speaking of things that didn't make the cut: These lists are not comprehensive. They aren't even a little comprehensive. Months before we pressed publish, we were bracing ourselves for the inevitable: NPR, HOW DARE YOU PUBLISH A LIST OF HORSE BOOKS AND NOT INCLUDE [INSERT NAME OF FAVORITE HORSE BOOK HERE]  I'LL NEVER DONATE ANOTHER DIME!!

Honestly, these lists could have gone on forever. We had to stop somewhere. So please don't stop supporting your local member station because Misty of Chincoteague didn't make it. (If you must know: It's because we decided it was about horses, but not horses as a mode of transit). We tried to select an idiosyncratic mix of old and new, known and unknown, and books for new and experienced readers alike. The point is book discovery, so we didn't always pick obvious books; we hope browsing this series feels like wandering into an unfamiliar section of the library.

On the car list, you'll find 'Go, Dog, Go!' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'The Mouse and the Motorcycle.'

Our favorite thing about these lists is the surprising and funny combinations you get when you decide to look at a very specific slice of something. We love that Anna Karenina and The Little Engine That Could are side by side. On the car list, you'll find Go, Dog. Go! and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with The Motorcycle Diaries and The Mouse and the Motorcycle.

Is this a useful way to organize books? We're not really sure. But it was a fun and interesting exercise, and it made us all add a bunch of new titles to our own reading lists. We hope you'll find some books that are new to you as well. Stay tuned in the coming months  our friends on the Arts Desk will be bringing you Book Your Trip stories on-air. (Bob Mondello has had us tapping our toes to transit-themed show tunes for weeks.)

And of course, outrage aside, we really would like to hear about the books that you would add to the lists. So please share your favorites with us in the comments section of the lists, or tweet them with the hashtag #bookyourtrip.

As always, we know you have a choice when you listen, so we'd like to thank you for choosing NPR Airwaves. You are now free to move about the cabin.","['sure', 'youll', 'things', 'transit', 'list', 'lists', 'trip', 'journey', 'books', 'reading', 'didnt', 'book']"

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

npr,,Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon,[],"Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon

As of Monday, Jan. 4 a.m. 10 a.m. ET:

 We are not using the words militia or militiamen on their own. A militia is organized to resemble an army (Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition). At most, this group may be called a self-described or self-styled militia. It doesnt resemble an army. Note: Reporting indicates there may only be a dozen or so men doing the occupying.

 We are not calling this a standoff. A standoff requires two sides. Right now, one group is occupying some lands and buildings while the other (the government) is considering what to do. Theres an occupation and it may become a standoff, but its not there yet.

 We have been using the words protesters and armed protesters. But the word protesters is not entirely adequate. These are armed individuals who have occupied government property. They are not simply citizens peacefully expressing their opinions, which is how the word protesters is more often used. This is an armed occupation. They are armed occupiers. They are armed men or armed individuals.

Militants is a better word than protesters. A militant is ready and willing to fight, according to Websters. These men say they are. The dictionary also says a militant is vigorous or aggressive in supporting or promoting a cause.

 As weve previously discussed, its best to avoid labels if possible. Use action words to describe who these people are and what they want. They are an armed group. They want an end to federal management of public land in the west. They are armed anti-federalists who want the states to control public lands in the west (referring to them simply as anti-government is not quite right).

Addition at 1:30 p.m. ET:

When referring to the dispute that Cliven Bundy and others have with the federal government, dont say its over grazing rights. Instead, say grazing fees, grazing privileges, grazing permits or some combination of those words  such as grazing permits and fees.

Mo, Goodwill is running a Valentine's Day promotion to encourage giving this weekend, as they are asking people to donate what?

MO ROCCA: Love.

SAGAL: That's so nice, but that's not what they're doing. In fact, in some ways it's the opposite.

ROCCA: The opposite of love is hate, so...

MAZ JOBRANI: So what would you have?

ROCCA: If you hated somebody, you'd give them, like, a shawl or like a...

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: You'd give them...

ROXANNE ROBERTS: Hypothetically, let's say you broke up with someone...

ROCCA: Yeah, oh...

ROBERTS: ...OK?

ROCCA: ...God, yeah.

ROBERTS: Yeah...

ROBERTS: You know, and maybe someone, you know, you hadn't seen for a long time and, you know, there was a toothbrush and there was maybe a sweater.

SAGAL: Maybe that person left some stuff at your house.

ROCCA: Giving - oh, giving stuff that belongs to an ex.

SAGAL: Right.

ROCCA: Yes.

SAGAL: Yeah, well, this assumes you haven't done the classy, mature, restrained thing and just piled it up on the front lawn and burned it.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: OK, so you're dumped, then you give your ex's stuff to Goodwill.

SAGAL: That is their argument.

ROBERTS: What if you are the dumper and you still have - you're supposed to send their stuff back, right? That's the right thing to do.

ROCCA: You can't do that. You can only do it - Goodwill should make it clear that it's only for people that were dumped.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: Like, why should the dumper be able to - to ruin someone's life and feel charitable?

JOBRANI: That's a good point.

SAGAL: You're right.

ROCCA: Think about this - you can deduct your cruelty now.

SAGAL: You can.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: You can actually dump someone and deduct that.

SAGAL: Could you...

ROCCA: I'm sorry I dumped you, but I needed to deduct you for my taxes.

SAGAL: Exactly.

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.","['cannibalism', 'purchase', 'book', 'travel', 'zuckoff', 'survivors', 'bring', 'plane', 'worst', 'world', 'guy', 'disasters', 'best', 'extreme']"

Many thanks to everyone for the care thats been taken with the information coming in from San Bernardino. Our language has been precise, weve added important context and weve been clear about whats known and what isnt.

The reportable and guidance notes from editors and reporters have been extremely helpful. One thing: Please remember to include language about the sources of that information. Its very important that we be able to tell listeners and readers where were getting our information.

Also, please continue to be careful about descriptions of the weapons. To many in the audience, assault rifles are fully automatic weapons that cannot be legally purchased. At this point, its better to refer to the rifles used in San Bernardino as assault-style.

But again, thanks. Weve gotten many messages such as this one posted on Facebook:

Thank you for reporting only the facts while others in the media build a frenzy just to be the first with new information, credible or not.

Crown Heights came to North Hollywood so we could talk about crossed signals on the highways between artist and industry. We also got into rap performance, being superstitious about writing, being not great about networking and this feeling: ""I felt like I was too smart to do a record and not talk about s*** that's happening now.""

ALI SHAHEED MUHAMMAD: What up, man?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: What's going on?

MUHAMMAD: Welcome to Microphone Check.

FRANNIE KELLEY: Yeah. Thank you for enduring the travel to come see us, also.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It was nothing.

MUHAMMAD: Wait. Let's not make it all about us though. I'm like  if you did ten hours to come to Microphone Check, that's like, man, salute. But why you in L.A.?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I came to do Microphone Check. That's why I'm in L.A.

MUHAMMAD: Seriously?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: For real for real?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm.

MUHAMMAD: I'll shut up. I'll take it all back. Salute you, then.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Came to do this, and I'll wiggle around and do some other things.

MUHAMMAD: Dope.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And my friend told me he's going to take me to some restaurant I really need to go to, so.

KELLEY: Which one?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I don't know. Which one?

FRIEND: Some good Persian food.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: OK.

KELLEY: Oh.

FRIEND: Atari Grill. In Westwood.

KELLEY: Oh nice.

MUHAMMAD: What do you like? What kind of food you like?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I like anything spicy. And chicken. Chicken, always chicken.

MUHAMMAD: Mm. Well 

KELLEY: There's good food out here.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I know.

MUHAMMAD:  if you do breakfast, there's a spot called BFD. It's on Beverly  I don't know what the street is.

KELLEY: Oh, I know that place you're talking about!

MUHAMMAD: The breakfast is crazy, and they got this spicy chicken. It just smacks your whole brain.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I think I've been there. Is that spot with the  they make really good French toast?

KELLEY: Yup.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It's like Frosted Flakes on the French toast?

KELLEY: Yup. It's really close 

MUHAMMAD: Oh, no no no.

KELLEY: Oh.

MUHAMMAD: That's Blue Jazz Cafe.

KELLEY: What?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Woo! That French toast. Woohoo! Crazy!

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. That French toast, yeah, that's crazy.

KELLEY: Where is this place?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I got a picture of that French toast on my laptop.

KELLEY: Wait. As like your background on your laptop?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: No. Just a picture in there.

KELLEY: Just saved?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And I look at it all the time like, ""Ooh, I want to go again.""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. That French toast is a problem. It's on Melrose. It's called Blue Jam Cafe.

KELLEY: Blue Jam?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: Oh, OK.

MUHAMMAD: Cause I think they have kind of like a vibe like it was a jam cafe, like you come in and play instruments. But you don't. And they have like a whole bunch of jazz musician and different artists  pictures on the wall. But that French toast.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That French toast worth the journey. That was worth the ten hours in Vegas.

MUHAMMAD: Well, if you want spicy chicken, go to BFD. It's on Beverly.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So in relation to the  so chicken versus toast. Where we going? If we only have one option. Say I had a plane to catch tomorrow.

MUHAMMAD: Yo, that French toast.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I'm telling you. It's really that good.

MUHAMMAD: That French toast. Yeah. The Frosted Flakes. And the thing is, they don't serve it with syrup. So you  customarily it's like, ""Can I get syrup?"" And you actually don't need it. I love maple syrup. But it's that 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Powdered sugar. Pff pff pff. That's the sugar. Pff pff. That's the sound of it.

MUHAMMAD: We might have to go there after this now. Cause I didn't eat breakfast at all.

KELLEY: Blow off the rest of the day.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: We have to experience this.

MUHAMMAD: Just  yeah. And be in a coma.

KELLEY: We could just go do the interview there.

MUHAMMAD: We should. Well, thank you for coming though.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Ah, no doubt, man. I appreciate being here.

MUHAMMAD: You been busy? What you been up to?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Me? I just put a record out on September 8th. Just a short EP. It's only five records.

MUHAMMAD: Is this the Live Forever?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Live Forever. Exactly. That's what it's called. So I been working that. This is the first interview I've actually done since I did it. This is like my first interview in two years.

KELLEY: Wow. Thanks.

MUHAMMAD: So you feel like  you didn't feel like talking to people?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I guess I didn't. Nah. I wasn't feeling  I didn't have a reason to. I didn't really  only talk when you supposed to. Don't talk just cause.

MUHAMMAD: I'm of that ilk as well. But 

KELLEY: I disagree with that.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: For real?

MUHAMMAD: Me?

KELLEY: No no. Not with your stance. I think it would be great if journalists could talk to musicians when they're off a cycle. Sometimes I wonder if that might lead to a more honest or more interesting conversation.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It's not about honesty.

KELLEY: Yeah. I know exactly what you're saying. And I also understand that  why would you want to speak to strangers and be, like, poked and prodded if there's no benefit to you. But I do think there's a lot of value in the conversations that we have with musicians that are private, because it's not on a cycle.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I could see that.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. Well, we  I guess cause we have a different kind of a conversation, you know. But 

KELLEY: Yeah. I guess it's like, ""Why do you talk to people?"" So ...

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Like, for me, I'm just a true believer in the fact that music is something that you live, you know. So like, I haven't done in a record in two years. But everybody's like, ""Yo, where's eXquire?"" I'm walking the streets, ""Hey! Where you at? What you doing? What the f*** you doing, n****?""

So it just be like  for me, it's like, ""Well, I'm living, so that I can have something to say."" I'm not somebody that just like generic, like, ""Shoot you in your face! Shoot you in your face!"" And yeah, you can do that a 100 times. I'm not like that. I'm creative, but I'm not creative in that way of just repeating myself 100 times. I have to go live, and then once I live, alright. I feel this. Alright. Now I want to make music, you know?

So really for journalists to talk to me during the time where I'm just living, I'm probably pretty boring.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So it'd just be wasting your time. Like, ""What're you up to?"" ""Ah, just reading."" You know, and that'd just be it.

KELLEY: You're the second person in two days to say reading in your off-time. I think that's like  that's not talked about enough, is how much goes into your work that is other people's interpretations of the world, and words. What have you been reading?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Right now I'm reading  so I read this book a bunch of times, Autobiography Of Malcolm X. I'm reading that again, because every time I read it I just get a different meaning from it. I'm reading that. And my uncle gave me this book the other day called The Metu Neter, which is about Egyptian religion and spirituality. It's supposed to be  I've read like two pages and it was mad heavy and I was like, ""Alright. I'm not doing this today.""

KELLEY: Take a break.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. And my homeboy, he put me on to this book, Motorcyle something. Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle 

KELLEY: Oh, yeah yeah. I know that. I've never read it, but I know of it.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So those are like my three  that's in my queue. If this is Netflix, that'll be in my book queue.

KELLEY: OK.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah.

KELLEY: That's very philosophical stuff.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I don't like to read fake stories. I like to either read like somebody's life  like, I like to read biographies and see how people come back from s*** and what they go through  or I just read something that's more about like spirituality or thought or some s***. You know, to put it in my music so I can sound smart.

MUHAMMAD: Well, let's just say you're smart.

And I respect your process of living, cause your music comes off to me very much like a author. And those great authors who write really deeply and intricately. It's almost like multiple authors. Some authors have like the same consistent voice throughout their books, but you go into different voices, but still with the concentration, I think, of a excellent writer. And so I guess that's through really taking the  absorbing what you experience in life and putting out there. But you do it in such a way, man; it's a lot.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm. It is. I know that. That's kind of like my double-edged sword of my career. I'm very heavy. I know that. And I think when I first started  when I first came out, I came out one way. And I think everybody expected me to be something else  which I was, but I was kind of growing out of that and becoming a man, at that time when people discovered me.

It was like, ""Oh, he's so wild!"" But I was  kind of did that for seven years before anybody heard me rap, so it was like, ""Alright."" When I first  when I got my record deal, my first record deal, my mother was sick and I just  I had to be a man now. It wasn't like  before it was just like, ""Oh! We in the projects! Oh, who that? Where the b******? Ah! Oh, whatever!"" You know? But I still had this other side to me, too.

But then as I matured, my music changed a lot. And I know it put a lot of people off, but I didn't give a f***. Cause  what? I'ma fake it? I'ma be a fake person? So I know my s*** is really heavy, especially now. My s*** even got super duper heavy. It just gets heavier and heavier. My next record is super heavy. It's so heavy I'm like, ""Maybe I shouldn't even put it out."" You know what I mean?

But it's like that for me. Which is kind of weird. Like you said like with the author, like  what's the dude's name? Johnny Depp played him. Hunter S. Thompson?

KELLEY: Oh, yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. He has this quote about like when he leaves life, he wants to be  he doesn't want to leave life in a protected shell. I don't want to leave life, you know, pretty. I want to leave like a broken, battered car, just f***** up because I gave everything I had.

And that's kind of been my philosophy to life forever. Which is scary, cause it's like, I still gotta be a person, too. Like, I'm a musician. And you know, you're a musician. So you know. This is something you give everything to.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Like, I'm getting emotional talking about it. Like, everything. Girlfriends. Friends don't like you no more. You don't see your mother. You don't see anybody. It's heavy.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And sometimes that's such a big sacrifice you like, ""F*** it."" But to not do it is to die physically. Like, be alive and be a zombie. But then to do it is kind of like  you're not going to leave this intact, you know?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Because you give so much of yourself to it.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You know what I mean? So s*** is heavy. S*** is heavy. That's all I can really say about it. From my perspective. That's how it is for me.

MUHAMMAD: It's heavy, but it feels good.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm.

MUHAMMAD: And compared to  I mean, there's things that I think, with a matter of age  for me personally, it's just, it doesn't come into my  my shell just can't receive it. But things that are really heavy and real and has a lot of depth, I'm way open to it. And I want to go on that journey, and there seems  I love the fact that you have sort of unapologetic spirit towards everything, which  I'm like, ""Wow.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm.

MUHAMMAD: It's admirable. It makes me wonder how you walk through Earth, but probably more free than most people.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, definitely.

MUHAMMAD: What's been your  let's just go back a step, because on the MC tip, you fierce as all the greats. Like, your lyrical stacking, your rhythms. As great as Rakim, as great as KRS, as great as Chuck D. What was your inspirations?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You know, to be honest, I was just a good thief. I'm a thief. Like, people don't  I'm just a thief. To be honest.

Like, I was a kid  I was an only child, so like, I wasn't outside a lot when I was young. I was a nerd. I was just in the crib. I was reading comic books. I was watching wrestling. And I was listening to rap. That was just my escape. But I was just a loner, just a weird kid. Always. When I was young.

KELLEY: So how did you get the music that you had? Like, who put you on?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Just my friends, growing up. I would meet older dudes in my projects and they were like, ""Oh, you never heard Biggie?"" I never heard Ready To Die till I was 16, you know what I mean? But I would get  my uncles would have a lot of records. My uncle had a vinyl, so I heard everything. It's a lot a s***. People like, ""You know that record?"" My mother always did that. Like old '70s songs. ""You know that record?"" ""Yeah, I know Gil Scott-Heron. I know Johnny 'Guitar' Watson.""

I studied. And I take from  as a MC, I'll take from them. I'll take from Gil Scott, as a MC. I'll take from Raphael Saadiq, as a MC. You know what I mean? So that's kind of how I've been able to always kill s*** or build myself as a musician. Is, I'm not afraid to listen to anything. I'm not afraid to borrow from it and just twist it and interpret it in my own style.

But like, heavy  like you said, Chuck D is a very heavy influence on me. Ice Cube on his first two albums. Very heavy influence on me.

KELLEY: That makes total sense.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Eminem. Heavy influence on me. Brother J. S*** like that. I just was  Just-Ice. If you want to talk old  Melle Mel. I listened to them. And then Nas, of course. Cause Nas was like me, to me. Like he was in the projects, and he was talking about s*** I saw every day.

And everybody. Beanie Sigel. You name it. I was listening to it. And I listened to Cash Money. I listened to 8Ball and MJG. I listened to Trick Daddy. I listened to Young Bleed. I listened to  yo, I'm like a rap dictionary, cause I listen to everything and I never was a closed-minded person like, ""What? That's not New York rap. F*** that. That's corny. They ."" Nah. Cause it's just everybody's experience.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE:  so I'm just soaking you up. ""Oh, OK. Who's this dude? This is Kendrick Lamar? Let me see what his life is like. I relate to that. I'ma take this part, but I'ma give him this part. And I'll put that with x.""

So that's kind of how my style was constructed. Like, you ever had a party mix bag of chips? You know, it got the cheese doodles. It got the pretzel, corn chip. You know what I'm saying? The Lays. That's my style. Just put it all together.

MUHAMMAD: So when you make a song like ""Nostalgia,"" is that just pretty much like laying up  what is that song to you?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, ""Nostalgia?"" Oh that's like the first song on my last EP, Live Forever. I wrote that song three times. I wrote that song one time when I was 19. I wrote it another time when I was like 22. And then I wrote it again for this record. I wrote it three times, cause I could never get it right. Or I would lose the beat or 

But I just was so married to that concept of just what it was  the concept of it was like  how do I explain it? Like, just random thoughts of your past. You know what I mean? Just all the things that make you feel good. Cause I know  you have your nostalgia goggles on, and certain things that you might not even gave a f*** about when you were 10, you think about them now; it gives you just a good, warm feeling, and it makes you remember who you are.

And like that's kind of what Live  it was the perfect intro because that's what this record was for me. It was like  like I said, I didn't do a record for two years. So I feel like I lost myself in the industry. I got that deal, and I was in it and I didn't know what the f*** was going on. And I was like, ""Ah, f*** it. I'll make music, but I'm not going to even put it out.""

And then I did this record as a statement piece of kind of  not so much for everybody else; that's why I didn't go hard and do a hundred interviews. I just wanted to do it for myself, and remind me who I was. And that's why that was such a perfect intro. Because it was like a love letter to myself and the things that  all the ingredients that made me.

And it didn't have any rhyme or reason to it, because your brain doesn't have a story. Your brain is just your brain. It's just scattered memories. You probably remember s*** that didn't even happen the way you think you remember it, if you really went in a time machine. But it's just, you remember those good parts. So that's what ""Nostalgia"" was about. Just jogging my memory, so to speak. You know what I mean?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I was really proud of that record actually. I really like that. I like that joint.

MUHAMMAD: So when you wrote it, each time you went back to revisist, did you like completely throw it in the trash and start over?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. It's like three different versions to that song.

MUHAMMAD: Wow.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. Similar stuff, but lyrically totally different. Totally different references and totally  everything. But just a similar point of what it is. So I did it three times. I did it a lot of times. Originally I did it over a Dilla beat, but I don't even know what happened to that version of it.

MUHAMMAD: How do you get with your producers? Cause your music is so complete.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: For me, I just  whatever moves me. Cause people are  I don't really have a  I wish I was able to work with like a Flying Lotus or like  I don't even know. I don't even know  just FlyLo. Let's just use him as an example or whatever. But I'm never really around like that. I'm not a networker dude. Like, I'm not always like, ""Yo, what's up, bro? Yeah. Gotta get up. Gotta go to the studio, bro."" I'm not like that. If I see you, I go, ""I like your music. Alright. Whatever.""

So like I usually work with who comes to me. If I find a producer or I'll just be scavenging online, I'll hit a dude up. Email him, ""Yo. I like you work. You want to do something?"" That's how I met the kid that did ""Nostalgia."" Maybe he'll never do another beat for me again. That one just spoke to me.

But my main producer that I work with, Constrobuz  he's been on every record I've done  we just met online. We've never even met in person, but we're really close. He just  he'll call me and just call me a b**** and hang up type of s***. S*** like that. We do s*** like that to each other.

KELLEY: I read this article recently about how the people that you have the best relationship are the meanest to you.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I agree.

KELLEY: I think it's kind of true.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Me and my best friend, we mean as hell to each other all the time.

MUHAMMAD: I don't have any mean people. People are not mean to me.

KELLEY: Well, you need to get closer to people.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, you might not be close enough to them.

MUHAMMAD: Note to self.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Find meaner people.

KELLEY: I'll be meaner to you from now on.

MUHAMMAD: Adrian has probably been the meanest to me.

KELLEY: That's true. That's very true.

MUHAMMAD: Seriously. I'm like  I'm not used to it.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, man.

MUHAMMAD: So now I know. He's good people.

KELLEY: Do you know this guy Jeremiah Jae? He's a producer from Chicago.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Jeremiah Jae.

KELLEY: He's kind of like  he's on Brainfeeder. Or not anymore actually. But I feel like you guys would be good together.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I've never heard of him. I'ma check him out though. I'ma give him a Google.

KELLEY: OK. That's fair.

MUHAMMAD: In terms of your former record deal and some of the maybe frustrations that may have come after in life for you, just in  through that that entire experience, to me, it sounds like you're too much of a loner. What's up with that? Why?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Why?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I don't know. I think I'm like Prince or some s*** like that. I'm weird.

KELLEY: Paisley Park in Crown Heights.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. Exactly. I got my space, and that's where I work. And that's bad, cause we rappers and s***, and that ain't how rap work. But  and I know that. I know. I know. But that's just how I work. Cause I 

You know what it is? I'ma tell you. When I first started, when I first came out, like  I have a very big personality on screen, but when you meet me, I'm actually a very subdued person. So people  I used to feel like people used to always meet me wanting me to be something I'm not, even though that's a part of me. But it ain't the whole me.

And I always would be afraid of letting them down. So like, I'd go to spots and I'd try to get drunk and, ""I'm having fun!"" But I really wasn't having fun. I don't think that you should be outside of yourself to do something you love.

MUHAMMAD: Absolutely.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So it made me withdraw, cause I'm like, ""Eh. I don't like that s***."" I never really went out. I wasn't no party  I'm not an outside person. My life revolves around music and women and my family.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's  those three  that's what's important to me. And my nerdy s***. Sitting in the house and color, collages, or make a jacket or some s***. You know? That's my fun. I don't really be wanting to be out like that. But I know I have to, to progress my career, cause that's just the game.

But like, if it was up to me, I would just be a dope artist that I could just put a record out. Got my fans; they f*** with it. And they'll wait for the next one. And I'll go do my shows, and I'll tour, and we'll have our fun, and I'll make the crowd laugh. I go the f*** home.

But it ain't like that, you know what I mean? It's like, ""Oh, you gotta go out, and, 'What's up, Joey Bada$$? What's good, my n****? Yeah, boy, let's get in the studio! We gotta work!'"" I just can't do it.

MUHAMMAD: I understand.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So that's why. I am a loner, cause I just am a loner.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I'm cool with that though. I'm cool. I'm good with that. I'm comfortable.

MUHAMMAD: I completely understand. I grew up sort of the same way. My mom used to be concerned cause I would never go outside. And when I'd go outside, I'd have friends, but I just was always in the house listening to music, practicing DJing all the time. Then my uncle got a keyboard, drum machine, so I'd just be in the house at 12, 13 just like messing up his presets. And my mom was like, ""My son is strange.""

And I'm still the same way. There're aspects where my managers and people'll are like, ""You know you need to go out and be seen. If you not seen, then people forget about you."" And that's a really truthful statement. I'm very comfortable staying in the studio all the time. Like, I'm good.

But just for you and someone who's as talented as you are and for some of the spaces that  the things that exist in the current space of promoting music and just networking and advances, I think like  I'm not saying go and go outside of yourself. But I feel like if you just made a couple of connects  I'm just curious how  maybe this is me projecting. I'm sorry. I don't mean to project.

KELLEY: Well, I think part of it is because  I mean, part of people's expectations is that when you were first introduced to sort of a broad audience, it was with a bunch of other people, cause of ""Huzzah"" and the video. And all those people are people that everybody wants to drink with and party with and get that late night text from or whatever, and so 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Don't wait for no text from me. It ain't coming.

KELLEY: Yeah. That's fair. But I mean, that's a thing, sort of choosing  I don't know. Did you decide to sort of enter like that, or did you know that that was going to happen? Did you plan it?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Honestly, like, at that time, I was just working. I was making eight dollars a hour, and we was rapping. And people just started liking what we was doing. But I never thought anybody would really know it. I hoped that. But  in your heart, you like, ""I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this."" But I never really had a idea of what doing this even was. It was just like, ""I know I'm good. I know I could rap. So, alright. Whatever.""

Even when I did that record, I didn't know none of them dudes. I didn't even know their music.

KELLEY: OK.

YouTube

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Honestly, I heard  when I first heard it, I'm like, ""This s***'s trash."" You know what I mean? And people love that song. When I heard it, I was like  I like the one I did by myself more.

But El, El was like my favorite at that time. And Danny. I knew them. Everybody else I didn't know them. But it was just, you know, s*** where you're all, ""Oh, they doing they s*** right now. You're doing your s*** right now. Just jump on a song."" S*** like that.

But for me, that really wasn't  that wasn't our music where I'm from.

KELLEY: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: In my hood, nobody know who them n***** was. It was just like, ""F*** is eX doing?"" That was kind of the vibe. Like, it was weird.

So that wasn't really no plan of mine. It wasn't like, ""Yo, that's part of the plan. OK. We got the six-month rollout."" I didn't know what rollout meant. Roll out meant we was gon' jump somebody. So, nah, I didn't even think about it that way.

KELLEY: And so was that part of the divide or miscommunication between you and the label?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I never had no miscommunication with the label. Honestly. Honestly, like, with the whole record deal s***, cause everybody  I never really spoke on it. But no. Like, I got a record deal; I didn't have a manager.

KELLEY: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You know what I'm saying? Like, f*** I thought I was doing?

KELLEY: Yeah. Sorry.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It ain't really nothing to talk about. People'll be like  it's not no deep s***. You can't have a record deal and not have a manager. It just don't work. You can't have your friends come in there like, ""Yo, I work at Vitamin Shoppe on Wednesdays but I'ma help manage you, boy."" Like, ""Alright. You're going back to the ghetto, cause that's not gon' work for you.""

So I didn't really have no manager and s***. I ain't have no booking agent or no none of that. At the time, I just had talent, but I didn't know. People just tell me, ""That's what you need to do when you rapping. You signed."" And you just caught up in that whirlwind, and then you don't even know what the hell is even going on.

So I never really had a problem when I was signed, like with the label. Like, ""Yo, let me go! I'm coming in with some bats."" I was chilling. I was good. It was more frustrating just not being to able to get my vision out quick and how I wanted to. Cause I didn't know how to make it happen.

KELLEY: Did you know what it was, your vision?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: What I wanted to do? I knew what I wanted to do.

But once again, it's like  it's like climbing a  it's like if I was to take a wet piece of tissue and throw it on the wall. Psh. That s*** is only going to go down. It's not going to crawl. It's not going to go up. So that's how it is when  I'm going to explain that analogy. That's how I look at any record you do when you get a deal. Say I came out and I was on some Wu-Tang s***. ""Come through with the "" that's what they going to want, 100 times. They going to want that. ""We signed you to rap like Wu-Tang.""

But like I said, I evolved as a man. I didn't just get a deal and, ""I'ma blow all my money and be a d*******."" Nah. I'm like, ""You know what? I should have somewhere to live that's nicer and s***. Nobody should be shooting at me."" Just thinking about things in a broader sense, and still to this day I do. I don't think they expected me to grow, when I got on.

So it was just like  it was just a conflict of the music I wanted to do and what they understood me being capable of doing, even though what I was doing was really good. I mean, I had a record with Adrian that's really good. So it's just like  that was the only miscommunication, just not having anybody to advocate for my ideas.

KELLEY: I mean, that's a big deal. That's a really big miscommunication, I think.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, yeah.

KELLEY: Yeah. I mean, cause my guess would be that they thought that you would sort of bring in other people and show up and make a lot of cameos, and that was their plan. And that's what I was saying, is that I think that they probably expected more ""Huzzah""-type activity, not even just from you but in the ways that you entered the room with other people.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, yeah. I don't know what they wanted. I try not to  the way I look at all that s*** in retrospect is kind of like: s*** happens. Charge it to the game. Then you move on and continue your life, cause if you dwell on s***, you be sitting around 50-years-old wondering where it all went wrong. You gotta just keep it moving. Like, ""Alright. I got that. I learned from it. I know stuff I didn't know before I went in. My life is different from the way it was when I started, so I won."" You know, regardless of however, you still won, cause you  I'm in a better position than  I'm in L.A.

toggle caption GL Askew II for NPR

I have friends who have never been to The Bronx. Like literally, I have friends who never been past downtown Brooklyn. They don't even know like, ""Oh, Lower East Side? Soho? What's Soho?"" I have friends that will say that, like, literally. That's crazy. So when I'm in L.A., I don't care about a deal, cause, like, I'm in L.A. I was in the ghetto. No money. I won.

Maybe I didn't do exactly what I wanted to do, and it didn't work how I envisioned it. But, so?

KELLEY: It can be instructive to other people, too.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Hmm?

KELLEY: It can be instructive to other people too, to hear you say it.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I would hope so.

KELLEY: To say that.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. That's why I could be honest about it, cause I would hope that somebody would hear me and understand it, and they'll take that in. And then move with it.

MUHAMMAD: How have you taken those lessons moving forward? Cause you're still making music obviously and you putting stuff out.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Always going to do that. I'm not sure yet. I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you.

MUHAMMAD: You have a manager?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: No. Not really. No.

MUHAMMAD: Why not?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yo! I could never meet anybody who wants to manage me. I ask people to manage me, and they be like, ""Nah, I'm busy."" Or whatever. So I just be like, ""Alright."" I ain't gonna, ""Alright, yo. Come in the bathroom, and I'll suck your d***. Get this manager."" So nah, you know what I mean? I don't really  I don't have one yet.

I want one though. Cause I think that's a good missing component for me. Somebody that could go out and advocate and network for me when I don't want to go out, or at least bring me out with them. I could do that good. Like, just go and chill. ""Hey, what's up, man? Have some wine coolers.""

MUHAMMAD: Hopefully after this interview people will be hitting you up. But not the people who cannot handle the task, but the right people will say, ""You know what? We understand who you are."" Cause your stuff is too dope for you to not be able to take advantage of what's out there for you. In representation. Just in content of the music and just your personality, it's large.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I appreciate that.

MUHAMMAD: Just the name is large as  I remember  I think the first time I heard your name was from Frannie, and I was like, ""What? Who?"" I was like, ""Alright. I need to investigate with a name like that."" So I just think, you know  it's just too much out there for you really, so I'm advocating for an advocate for you.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Advocate for advocates. I like that.

KELLEY: So what you're working with now is different. Have you performed it out?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah, I haven't done anything yet.

KELLEY: Are you planning to?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Of course. Yeah. I love to perform. I love it.

KELLEY: OK. Yeah. Is it like  I feel like  not knowing at all, I feel like there are kind of two approaches to performing where it's like, ""I need the crowd to come with me."" And it's like, ""I'm going to lead. I'm going to be the thing that the crowd is passive and receives."" What's your  I don't know if that's true. Is there a third way?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I think somewhere in the middle.

KELLEY: OK.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. Depending on the record.

KELLEY: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It's tone. It's like the tone that you set. Me personally, I prefer to  cause I always look at  I look at records like  it's like categories for how you doing s***. Like, this is a record that's more hype and crowd involvement. Chorus heavy. It's like call-and-response they chanting with you. Then you have certain things that they just want to listen to you. It's story time, bed time type s***, you know?

So I think you  for me, I tend to start with, ""Ah! Let's go!"" Tire 'em out, and I'ma be tired too cause I'm a big m***********. And then speak to 'em. I could talk to them and get those real messages in. Cause now they receptive. Like, if they didn't know me, they're like, ""Oh, this dude's ill. Let me see what else he got to say."" Now they're open. They're receptive. Once they tired; they probably jumped for like six songs. Now they like, ""OK. Let me see what he got to say.""

But it's a balance of it. Too much of one thing  that's kind of what I think is the missing component with a lot of rap now. Is that every artist is like a f****** Converse, let's say. Like, it's just, ""Alright. I'm a Converse."" But like before, it's like, ""Alright, well I'm a high Converse, a low Converse, a mid. I don't have laces."" Like, rappers were more diverse, and what 

Like, Biggie got a song about his mother getting cancer. Then he's a player on the next song. Then he kill his self on the last song. He's a player who just killed his self on the last song. That's what a artist is supposed to be. Now you hear these dudes; they don't lose. They win every time. They f*** every girl. The cops come, but they don't: ""We don't give a f***! F*** the cops."" That's not reality. No! You know what I mean?

So it's like, they don't  it's just  and that  what I think that does, it numbs the music. Cause it's not  it's no consequences to what you're stating. You're not really a man anymore. You're like a cheeseburger or some s***.

KELLEY: Yeah. I think people 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: But  I'm sorry. Sorry. Go ahead.

KELLEY: No no no. I think people are just doing super short sets, so they don't have to deal with what you're saying. Also, I think that people are using the word artist, and some people  it has very different meanings.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: OK.

KELLEY: You know, ""artist"" can be interchangeable with ""musician"" or ""rapper"" or just a person who one time put out a rap song.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah.

KELLEY: And then artist as somebody who synthesizes the whole world and can't not do this work and, like, changes over time. That's totally different things.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And I don't think that it's a ""supposed to"" with it. Like, you know, certain s***  alright, high tops. Some '80s s***, doesn't make them any less cool today. And then some things are like timeless.

KELLEY: Yeah, yeah. I understand.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You see what I'm saying? You have to have some somebody that has to be of the time. And then you have somebody that defines the time. You need both.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Like, Kwame is just of that '90s s***. That's the '90s. When you see that, that is absolutely, positively the '90s. Tupac transcends time. But that doesn't make one's contribution any less potent, you know? To me.

KELLEY: Yeah. I understand.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's why I don't like, ""Oh, he's wack! He's f******  Rae Sremmurd!"" Like, ""Yo, let them rap."" Let them rap. They gotta represent for now, what kids are about now. Kris Kross was what kids were then. And that's fine. You could look back it 40 years and say, ""Oh, what was the kids like in '93? Oh, yeah, that's it."" And then some people just the whole all-encompassing great artist.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And that's cool. Both is needed.

KELLEY: I understand. I understand.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: To me. Some people mad at me right now for saying that.

KELLEY: No. It's just that there can be confusion, cause people think that they're talking about the same thing, and they're not.

And then also with the whole  with the short set thing, it's like, there's so many opportunities for people to show up and play three songs. And nobody's really understanding that that is a completely different way of performing. Different requirements, different songs need to be written. And yeah, you need stamina. You need to be healthy before you even go into that.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, you do.

KELLEY: So that's why I'm curious about your plans for performing.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: For me  i don't even know. I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you. I'm not going to make nothing up to sound cool. I don't know. I haven't really sat down  I want to do a couple rehearsals and just figure out  I want to take it up another notch, like with a projector, and really make it visual and interactive. So when people see what I'm saying they really see what I'm saying. Like, ""OK. I really get eX now."" You know what I mean?

KELLEY: Yeah. I feel like people would expect that from you.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I gotta give them something to pay for, you know?

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: For real. You can't say, ""Oh, I want to make this amount a show,"" but you come in just rapping drunk. F*** you. I'm not coming again.

KELLEY: The Wu-Tang model.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, I don't know. I'm not throwing no shots. Never seen 'em live.

KELLEY: I will. I paid for that s*** several times.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You knew what you was getting!

KELLEY: That's true.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's the experience.

KELLEY: That's very fair.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That was performance art.

KELLEY: Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Have you ever seen Wu-Tang?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: You probably saw them a long time ago, though.

MUHAMMAD: That's what I was thinking. I remember we performed with them like 

KELLEY: Oh, I was there for that  one of those.

MUHAMMAD: Which one?

KELLEY: One of those Rock The Bells shows.

MUHAMMAD: The Rock The Bell  well, yeah.

KELLEY: I mean, that was recent.

MUHAMMAD: But nah, I was  my head was going way, way back. Like way back. I remember  well, were they performing at all? Cause I just  Ol' Dirty would show up some times and just take over s*** that he wasn't supposed to be  so that's  when you said that, I'm just thinking about him, specifically, not all of Wu. But, yeah, I've been to a couple of Wu shows. Yeah. You know what you getting when you 

KELLEY: It's common knowledge.

MUHAMMAD: You might  it's  at some point  it is now. But back then, I don't  cause I'm going back to the beginning, you know, and I'm like, ""Nah, you really didn't know what you was going to get with Wu."" But it was a different time back then, so it was  just their entrance into a building was just exciting.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. They were.

MUHAMMAD: It's just  the energy just shifted completely when Wu was in the building. So  and you accepted it. Now you accept it cause you know, but you still angry cause you just  I think there's a glimmer of hope. Like, ""This time, it's gonna ""

KELLEY: One time 

MUHAMMAD: You think like, ""OK. They grown men. They gon' come now  they all "" it especially depends on who shows up, too, right?

KELLEY: Well, of course. Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: You gotta factor that in. And so, I think you have this hope like, ""OK. The Wu is here. They gon' set it straight now."" And 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah?

KELLEY: I feel like '05 or '06, Valentine's Day, I saw them, and the RZA, like, tried. He had this shirt that was mostly holes and then he ripped it off at one point. Like, he put in effort, and everybody really appreciated it. But, nah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I never knew that. I thought they was  I never seen them though, so. They look good in the videos.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: They look good to me.

MUHAMMAD: I mean, at this point, I don't know. Let me not say that. Cause I was about to say, well, they just, you know  I'll use the word ""elder statesman.""

KELLEY: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: And so, at that point, you can do whatever you want to do.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You legends, man.

KELLEY: Well, it's a nostalgia tour, too.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Bulletproof.

KELLEY: You know, like you go see New Edition. It's  they, like, kind of try.

MUHAMMAD: Hey. Different strokes for different folks.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: But you know we bring a show.

KELLEY: I know. I've seen it.

MUHAMMAD: We bring it. Period. Point blank.

KELLEY: You know that dance that you guys do where you turn 

MUHAMMAD: Oh, we probably won't be doing that anymore.

KELLEY: That's my favorite part.

MUHAMMAD: I don't know if I like that.

KELLEY: Why not?

MUHAMMAD: I only liked it for a moment when Tip was doing it. But it's like 

KELLEY: What?

MUHAMMAD: Cause I understand  I understood for a moment that was just something he was trying to get Phife into, so it worked. But that was just that one time. I know. I'm the too serious person of the crew. Tip may override it.

KELLEY: What's the best  who's the best rap performer?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: To me?

KELLEY: Like right now and then of all time?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: The best one I ever saw in my life: Big Daddy Kane.

KELLEY: Yeah, man. Cause he always still brings Scoob and Scrap out.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Big Daddy Kane. Honorable mention, the person that impacted me most by seeing them perform live was Sean Price. Hands down.

KELLEY: Oh my god.

YouTube

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. First time I seen Sean Price was at Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival. This was before I ever did a show. And I remember seeing him, and he was just like a giant. You know? Just like his neck moving: ""Afrika Bambaataa, whip bap woo."" Like, yo. I'm like, ""Yo!"" And I'd never heard his  I'd never really heard his solo stuff at that time. And I was like, ""Yo! He's amazing!"" That's when he did ""Monkey Barz."" ""Sean P!"" That one. Yo! I just  I remember. I'll never forget. It was raining that day, and I was just like  I was just amazed. That's the most amazing show I ever  to this day  I ever seen in my life.

But as far as like, who's the best to me? Kane. Kane. Kane is the best on stage. By his self. His wind is mad crazy. He's like 100 years old.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah. He's like one year older than Jay Z really.

KELLEY: Really?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, he's not that much older than Jay Z. It's just Jay Z came out later, but they like the same age, around my mother's age.

KELLEY: Wow. Remember when he opened for Jay at the  when they opened Barclays?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah yeah yeah.

KELLEY: That was really cool.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: And he still could do the spin kick.

KELLEY: Yeah! I know.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I'm young, and I can't do that spin kick. I can't do that s***.

KELLEY: I'm just a big proponent for synchronized dancing in rap performances.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I'm noticing that.

KELLEY: I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

MUHAMMAD: No. It's not.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Of today, who's the best? Travis Scott is the best to me.

KELLEY: You know what? I saw him recently, and I cannot argue with that.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I think he's the best right now.

KELLEY: I don't like  I'm not a huge fan, but those songs live  well, he had Mike Dean with him.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: OK.

KELLEY: When I saw him. And so the songs were different, and that s*** was crazy.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. He's crazy.

KELLEY: Mike Dean is  I'll go to anything he plays. Always.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I think Travis got it right now. As far as the live stage show? That boy's crazy. He's a pastor.

KELLEY: People go crazy.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah.

KELLEY: They really lose it for him.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, he's like a  he's a pastor. He got the church. Like, holy ghost, all day. Everybody.

KELLEY: And his projections are really graphic, like blocked out and the high contrast. It was really smart. Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: He figured it out. He figured it out big time. I like him a lot. I respect him.

KELLEY: Yeah. I was thinking about people  when you said that you were a thief earlier and how 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: When you said that first, I was like, ""I said I stole it?"" Then I realized you're just talking about it.

KELLEY: I know, right? But that's what I'm saying. I feel like that word is a little bit unfair. And I've heard that applied to Travis also, which is totally unfair because if you look at the timeline, who's stealing from who? And also there's Mike. But what could be a different way to kind of describe looking at the world and ingesting it?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Sponge.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: My man Hillie Hill. Shout out Hillie if he hearing this. But my man Hillie  from Queens, actually  my man Hillie, he always say that. ""Yo,"" you know, ""Sponge. Sponge."" Sponging is fine. Stealing is wrong. Sponging is fine.

KELLEY: Yeah. Like, why do people put it out there if they don't want people to take it in?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You got to. You're supposed to. You hope that your work will live long enough for people to steal.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Cause people don't steal from corny people.

KELLEY: Or like go far enough out so that people you've never even heard of before  yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm. I would hope so. If nobody stealing from you, then that might say something about 

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. What you producing.

KELLEY: Yeah. Cedric, who does our social media is like, ""If your record doesn't leak, people don't want it.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Mm-hmm. That's true.

KELLEY: That's how you know.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I could see that.

KELLEY: Yeah. I would also like to know a little bit more about your writing process. You've said  I mean, has that changed as you have matured?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: No. I write really weird. I still write on paper.

KELLEY: You like Pusha.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I need that paper. I need that feeling. I just need to feel that pen and see it. I might have  and it helps me with how I say it too. Because I might write a word really big, cause I'ma yell that word.

KELLEY: OK. Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Or I might write it really small, cause I'ma whisper it.

KELLEY: That's cool.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I do it based off  I might really make the letters dark, cause I know want to put ""Ah!"" in that one. Or  and I write all over the page. I write upside down and everywhere.

KELLEY: Whoa.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Cause I had a  my best friend when I was growing up  I used to be really embarrassed about rapping. I never used to tell people I could rap. And my best friend used to always come to my house, ""What the f*** is this? F*** is this? You rapping?"" ""Nah, nah. I ain't rapping."" So he would just start spitting. ""This is a rap!"" He'd start spitting my rap.

So then I saw that. I got a trick for his ass. So he'd come to my house, and I would start writing it upside down and left and right and everywhere. So he'd open my book up to f*** with me, and he couldn't figure out where it ended or where it began. So he stopped f****** with it. And that's how I ended up  when you look at my notebook it just looks like, ""Ahhh!"" Just everywhere. It just became a habit.

KELLEY: That's nuts.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Cause I just be so insecure about people looking at it, like reading my thoughts. Like, ""Oh, I didn't know he f***** her."" So I just be like, ""Yo, decode it if you can.""

KELLEY: OK.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's pretty much my process though.

KELLEY: So do you then  like when you're re-writing, do you write again on the same page? Or do you have to start all over?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, it depends on how I feel. Sometimes I feel like pages have bad energy, when I'm writing.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So I'm like, ""This page has bad energy."" So I just tear it out the book, cause I'm like, ""This page, this specific sheet of paper, is gonna give me a wack rhyme. So I'm getting rid of you. It's something  the devil's in this page."" So I just tear it out. Psh. Like, I have books that are like six pages big. You know what I'm saying? I don't f*** with bad energy pages. I might skip four pages like, ""This page feels good."" It's like superstition. Yeah. I don't touch it.

KELLEY: I'm that way with documents on my computer. I'm just like, ""That one's not OK.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. ""Get out of here.""

KELLEY: ""I need a new one.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Fresh energy, right?

KELLEY: Just delete it. Yeah. There's a lot of superstition in writing, I think.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I think so. I don't know. I only know my crazy s***, so.

KELLEY: Yeah, I mean, same. But I see things people think they're hiding. And it's like, ""Oh, no. You scared.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So yeah, that's the vibe.

MUHAMMAD: I got a question about a line.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: What's up?

MUHAMMAD: I have to ask cause I'm Muslim. So when you say, ""As-salaam-alaikum""  when you say 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Trying to remember the line.

MUHAMMAD: ""Pray""  you said something. What you say? Something about salad with the favorite bacon.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Salad with bacon bits.

MUHAMMAD: Bacon bits. You say 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: ""As-salaam-alaikum, y'all be faking with that praying s***.""

MUHAMMAD: Why you say that? Who are you talking to?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Alright. So  OK. The line is, ""And my favorite salad caesar with a little bit of bacon bits. Don't tell my OGs but I be eating bacon bits. As-salaam-alaikum, y'all be faking with that praying s***."" Yeah, just bacon and alaikum, it just sound good together. But then the line after that, ""Y'all be faking with the praying "" I seen everybody like  at the time, everybody was doing all this  in the picture, everybody's doing prayer beads 

KELLEY: Oh, when you like squat down.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE:  and like kufis was like in style. Dudes was wearing religious garb for like fashion. And I just thought that s*** was corny, so I just threw a shot at that.

Like, don't disrespect people's religion. Don't do it. It's people who make it look fly cause they Muslim and they just could dress, but don't you be like  just dudes were just throwing crosses with kufis with all types of  I'm like, ""Yo! What's wrong with these dudes?"" You gotta have a certain  you see certain stuff I wear, like, but I be knowing what it is. My father's a Rasta, so I wear  I have Selassie on my jacket for my dad and s*** like that.

So like, I respect it. That's all I'm saying with the line. Like, y'all be faking with that praying s***. You can't wear a kufi and be doing one thing, and you don't even know what you representing.

MUHAMMAD: Right.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's spirituality. That's energy. You cultivating energy anytime you do that. So you can't just  it's not just some s*** to do in the club pouring Henny on the kufi, and  you know what I mean? Nah. Respect it. So that's really what that line meant. Y'all n***** is fake with that s***, man. F*** out of here.

MUHAMMAD: And I figured that. I just wanted to hear from you.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you already caught it. Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. I mean, because you did mention the kufis, I think, in the line before or the right after.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: The line after I say that. Yeah.

MUHAMMAD: But I just wasn't sure if it was in the abstract or it was to some  a group of people that you hang out with specifically or 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, I'm just like, ""What's wrong with y'all dudes, man?""

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You look stupid. So that was it.

MUHAMMAD: The only other question I have is just in terms of the landscape of where you are as an artist versus other people  and I don't think you to be a person to compare yourself at all, but just in terms of drawing from life and where life is for a young black male in America right now, how does that affect you? Or does it affect you? Does it come out? Will it come out in your art?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's actually what my next record is about.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I felt like I was too smart to do a record and not talk about s*** that's happening now. Like, cause I could really say something that I felt like  and I could break it down in a way that people who may not be able to articulate themselves as well as I can, they can get something from it. So that's really a big part of what my next record is about, actually. It's funny you said that.

So that's kind of where I am with it anyway, naturally. Because you can't avoid it. You seeing  every day it's like  and it's kind of f****** infuriating, you know? And where do you channel that anger? Or where does anybody channel that anger? Eventually, it gets to the point where I think even the most deaf, dumb and blind m*********** is gonna be mad soon. Cause it just getting so blatant. It's only so many times you can say, ""Oh, well, maybe, you know ..."" It gets to a point like, ""No, f*** that, man."" And I think that's where I am.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You know what I'm saying? So, yeah. Definitely I think  my next record is about that, big time. But it's not about that. Like, it's not very preachy. But it's very  it's coded. It's there. I definitely put it there in a way  just to make people think. Just to give people 

Because before you could take action or any stance in life, you have to have perspective. Perspective, then action. You can't just go out swinging and, ""Ah!"" You're gonna get f****** killed. You're going to get your head bust. This next album is just about my perspective as a black male in 20  well, it'll be '16 when it comes out. So that's what it's really about. It's really about my blackness, and really about who I am.

And I think I have a tale to tell, because of my age and because of the timeframe I came up in. I'm of now, but I'm still kind of  I grew up then, too. So like, I'm right in the middle. I'm right in the middle. So I think I have something that a lot of people younger than me can't really say, cause they missed a lot of that s***. And then older people than me, they're not really in the grass anymore to really be able to come and speak. So I think it's a good spot for me to be at right now. Cause I'm  I'm actually very happy about it.

MUHAMMAD: Good.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. So that's what I'ma do.

KELLEY: What do you want people to think about? Can you give us a preview?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I just want you  I want people to think about practicality. Just like  y'all ever heard of the sankofa bird?

KELLEY: Mm-mm.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You heard of sankofa bird?

MUHAMMAD: Mm-mm.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It's like this African proverb about sankofa, the sankofa bird. Like, you can't go forward until you look backwards.

It's a movie about it. This chick, she's like a Nicki Minaj-type chick. She's famous. And like, she wear a blond wig and s***, and people are like, ""Oh, what's up?"" And she like, ""I'm not black. I'm not "" but she's like light-skinned. And then like she's doing a shoot in Africa on the beach, and then she goes in a cave, and then she meets a witch doctor, and he makes her a slave. That's what the movie's about. You should check it out, if y'all ever get a chance. It's a real good movie.

KELLEY: OK.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: But I say that to say, my album isn't about like, ""Oh, f*** the n***** and kill the cops,"" and dumb s***. Nah. It ain't about that. It's just about  I don't want to go too in depth because I'm still creating it. But it's about gaining perspective to not be so  alright. For instance, I have song called ""A Pigeon Ain't S*** But A Ghetto Dove."" It's a record I wrote. I played it for him in the car on the way here. And it's about  I talk about the word ""b****."" The whole verse, every line I say is ""b****.""

MUHAMMAD: Which you say a lot by the way, but.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, I do. I do curse a lot. My father says it. ""I love your music; you curse too much. Can't listen to it.""

KELLEY: That's like my mom.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: So yeah, I say b****. Every line in the song is b****. It's a different variation of what a b**** is, what I think a b**** is. Then the second verse is about ""n****."" And I say n**** like every bar. I might say it two times a bar. But it's just really kind of breaking it down where you kind of start seeing how we see n**** but then what n**** really is. And I just  that's what I'm saying. Just giving a perspective, a set on it.

Like, alright, what are we really b******* about? Or what's really important? You know, like, perspective. People talk about some dumb s***, like, ""Oh. They got this TV show where he's married to a white girl."" It's like, yo, it's mad crazy s*** going on. And all the social media outrage and everything.

It's like, start thinking about  let's get to a baseline normal where we all can kind of have a forward-thinking  everybody's like, ""Alright. Well, this is what we need to be doing."" And then we can start doing it. But the way s*** is now it's too mefuddled. It's all convoluted with the Internet.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nobody knows where to even start.

So that's the kind of where I look at this record. Just if you listen to it, you could understand my doctrine and what I feel like. Not saying I'm Chuck D or no s*** like that, but just like, yo, this is how I see what I am and where I'm from and what it means today. And maybe you could take some of it and you could see, ""Alright. This some b******* going on.""

And you could be part of the b******* a little bit. Like, I go to strip clubs and s***. I like ass. You could like whatever you like, but just have a mind, too. That's kind of the perspective I want you to have: do what you do, but think. And that's kind of what the record's about.

KELLEY: So how do you  when you're going to write  when you're going to go in on ""b****"" for a half a song and your album is about being a black man, how do you educate yourself on the perspective of a black woman? Or a woman 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I talk to my moms.

KELLEY:  of anything. OK. What does she say?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: My mom about b****?

KELLEY: Yeah. I mean, about being a black woman right now.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, my mom is always angry. My moms  she called me; she said, ""If I was in good shape, I'd go tear something up."" That's my mother.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. That's how she is. But we just have  me and my mother are very close. Cause I'm a only child, so we just have a natural relationship. We have these conversations all the time. Anytime I talk to her, she's like, ""Oh, did you see this? Let me send you this link, cause I didn't like the way he said this."" We always having a conversation. So I'm always kicking it with her. Or when I had a girlfriend, I'd be kicking it with my girl all the time.

Just getting different  cause I'm, like I said, sponging. And just getting the vibe and kind of knowing, alright, how do we place this and how do we just  I can't give away too much. I'm trying to talk around. I don't want to say too much right now about this record.

MUHAMMAD: Nah. Don't share it too soon.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. I don't want to bust it out on y'all yet.

KELLEY: I want to know. This is our internal conflict. He gives people space; I don't really want to. Are we going to hear your mom on the record?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I might just throw her on a song. My father's on my last record. That was a big, big, big, important thing. Cause I hadn't spoken to him for damn near 10 years before he got on my record.

KELLEY: Wow.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That was like our reconciliation. That was like my first time seeing my dad, was him being on my record.

KELLEY: Damn.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Since I'd seen him since I was like 19 or some s***. That was powerful for me.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: Did it continue your relationship? Did you guys 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yo, me and my dad are like best friends now.

KELLEY: Wow. That's amazing.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Crazy, yo. Crazy. It's almost surreal to me sometimes.

KELLEY: Wow.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Because I didn't ever think  I just kind of already put it in my mind, which is bad to do. Like, ""Oh, we not going to kick it like that. We not gonna have that relationship."" But now, he's like my best friend. I talk to my dad every morning. This morning he text me, ""Oh, you got there safe, right? What's up?"" It's like the best s***. Cause it just gives you  being around my dad, just sitting in the kitchen with my dad watching him cook, I get a whole perspective on myself.

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: It's so simple like, ""Oh s***, I do that too. Oh, when I sit down, I hold my feet that way."" Cause it's so many things that he has of me that I didn't even know of me, till I see that I got it from him. Or he'll make a joke like, ""That's some s*** I would say."" Or he'll see a chick in the street like, ""That's a chick I would like.""

It's just like, ""Damn."" It gives you just such a reinforcement of your manhood, having your dad around. And it's never too late for that. Give a f*** if you 100 all in the old folk's home together. You gon' get something from that s***. But yeah yeah yeah. Long story short. I don't even know what the question was anymore, but 

KELLEY: You nailed it. We're good.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Alright. Cool.

KELLEY: That's the coolest part about getting older is that you really realize you don't know what's going to happen. Like, no idea.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah.

KELLEY: Man, thank you so much for speaking with us and coming out here.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Ah, man. I jumped at the opportunity to do this, cause I know it would be like a real conversation. It wouldn't be like generic rap questions. ""So what you been up to, man? You been getting money?"" ""Yeah, I'm getting money, my n****. S******* on these haters."" So, you know, I don't like that type of s***.

MUHAMMAD: I'm just wondering when you gon' take up professorhood. Professor  is it professorship? I don't know.

KELLEY: I think so. I think you're right.

MUHAMMAD: I don't know what the proper word is. But I totally see you in a university, just schooling kids, man.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Ah, man. Have to get past the ninth grade first.

MUHAMMAD: I mean 

KELLEY: That doesn't matter.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I didn't make it past ninth grade.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. That doesn't matter.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I could do that? You could still do that?

KELLEY: Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I didn't know that.

MUHAMMAD: Yeah. Just network.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: OK.

MUHAMMAD: There's a couple things you probably have to do, some qualifiers.

KELLEY: First, a manager, then a 

MUHAMMAD: But yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Alright.

MUHAMMAD: I just say that, because you're  the things you speak about, it's just like depth, you know. And it's knowledge, and obviously it comes from somewhere. So, obviously, perspective is important like you were speaking about before, but also knowing where you come from.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. It's important. So I gotta start networking with professors?

KELLEY: Yeah. Free wine, I'll tell you what.

MUHAMMAD: Just talk to 9th Wonder. Cause then it's a context. 9th, he does that from a music perspective, but then 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: He's doing that now, right?

MUHAMMAD: Yeah, but then it can open up to  you never know what it can open up to if that's something you interested in. But I just say that just  I mean, your music is enough of a starting point for some kid who's also trying to be a sponge. And from other stuff that they hear on Top 40 radio that's  it's just not really being absorbed deeply into their soul that they could benefit from. But I think some of your songs, there's a lot. It's so much feeling in it. I don't know. That's just me.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah, nah. I'd love to do that. I would love to speak, and  Killer Mike does that too.

MUHAMMAD: Yup.

KELLEY: Yup.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: That's my big bro right here. He's an inspiration.

KELLEY: You guys talk?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah, we talk. That's my boy. He  that's my man. He's not a boy. But like, yeah. That's my man. He's 

KELLEY: Have you ever been on the road with them together, as Run The Jewels?

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: No. When I went, they weren't Run The Jewels yet.

KELLEY: Right. Yeah.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Yeah. They weren't even  they were thinking about it.

KELLEY: I remember 

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: I watched them talk  I watched it come  I watched the brainstorming of that. I watched that album.

KELLEY: Man, that's amazing.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah, they killing it. I'm so proud of them. I saw El in a bar like two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago. He's like  I had one red shoe on and one green shoe. He was like, ""Yo, your shoes are mismatched.""

KELLEY: And you're like, ""It's Christmas.""

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Nah, he loved it. He's like  it was Christmas. Yup. Green and red. I had a green and red sweater on too. He said, ""Holy s***. I like that s***."" Yeah, I seen him the other day. I love them. I love El. I'm so happy for him. He deserves this s*** so much. Him and Mike. I love it. I love it. I love it. I'm just like  like it's me. You know what I mean?

KELLEY: Yup.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: You know when you happy for somebody like it's you?

KELLEY: Yup. For sure.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Oh, yeah. Like, ""Get it!""

MUHAMMAD: Word.

KELLEY: Yeah. Thanks again.

MUHAMMAD: Alright. Cool.

MR. MFN EXQUIRE: Alright, that's it?

KELLEY: Yeah, we're done.

npr,2014-06-17 00:00:00,Hold Your (Literary) Horses! An Exceedingly Equine Herd Of Books : NPR,[],"In the beginning of this Little House book, the Ingalls family travels over a frozen Mississippi River and through the woods of the Midwest to make its home on the Kansas prairie. But, being a pioneer story, it isn't a smooth journey. In Minnesota, the family is held up by mud from rains, and it takes the opportunity to trade its tired horses for a pair of mustangs. In Kansas, those same mustangs struggle to swim the family's covered wagon across a deep creek, and Pa has to dive in to guide them to the other side. More adventures await after the Ingalls settle on the Plains  from building a house to meeting the neighbors to fighting off fevers and dealing with Indians.

I remember that reading this book as a kid, I was struck by how tough 19th century life was. But now I'm more impressed by the story's grown-ups. For two parents leading their family into unknown territory, Ma and Pa's composure is awe-inspiring. Maybe that (and a pair of good mustangs) was the secret to making it as a pioneer. (For ages 8 to 12)

A Reading List For Riding The Rails : NPR,[],"Patricia Highsmith and Agatha Christie made well-known use of the train as a confined setting for their thrillers  but a less well-known example is this violent, mesmerizing book from the great French novelist Emile Zola. It's part of his 20-volume Les Rougon-Macquart cycle, but don't worry, I've been assured that you don't have to read the other 19 if your beach bag just won't fit them and your sunscreen. La Bete Humaine isn't exactly a sunny read, though  it's an exploration of what kinds of murderous tendencies we've all got locked up in our psychological cupboards and how accessible the keys are. The book, with its high body count, is set against the backdrop of the railway between Paris and Le Havre. In just the first chapter a woman confesses to a sexual molestation in her past, is beaten and threatened by her own husband for the sin committed against her, and a plot to murder the molester is concocted. And we haven't even met the other main character, loosely based on Jack the Ripper, whose most potent love affair is with the train. Hey, it's not called The Human Kitten. What's the fun in reading this grisly story, besides the racing plot? It's Zola's exploration of what creates the desire to kill  all experienced from the safety of your own (hopefully) locked cupboard.

i Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The debate over whether Apple should unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook isn't the first time the company has clashed with law enforcement.

The FBI also wanted to unlock the iPhone of a drug dealer in Brooklyn. Jun Feng pleaded guilty to selling methamphetamine last year. As part of its investigation, the government obtained a search warrant for Feng's iPhone. But the phone was locked by a password, so prosecutors asked a judge for an order compelling Apple to unlock it.

""In about 70 prior occasions, this exact situation had occurred,"" says Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer, who's now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""And Apple had elected to comply with the court order.""

The fact that Apple had unlocked roughly 70 phones in previous cases was revealed during a court hearing last October.

And Apple might have quietly unlocked Jun Feng's phone, too, but something unusual happened. Federal Magistrate Judge James Orenstein did not sign the order the government wanted. Instead, he went public and asked Apple if the company had any objections.

""What was remarkable was that the public hadn't seen the argument surfaced,"" says Jennifer Granick at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. She says Judge Orenstein was trying to stoke a public debate. ""Judge Orenstein had concerns about whether the government's legal argument was a valid legal argument.""

The judge seemed particularly skeptical that the government relied in part on an 18th-century law called the All Writs Act. Prosecutors say it gives them authority to compel private companies to help carry out search warrants.

The government probably expected Apple to comply, just like the company had dozens of times before, says Hennessey.

""What All Writs is intended to do is that in those areas where Congress has not spoken, it's intended to fill the gap, such that the courts can effectuate their orders,"" Hennessey says. ""This is precisely how All Writs has been applied throughout history.""

But this time, lawyers for Apple disagreed. They said the company had complied when the law seemed settled, but at the hearing in Feng's case in October, Apple's lawyers argued that the government was actually asking for something novel: the power to force a tech company to unlock one of its devices.

It's similar to the argument that's now playing out in California, where the FBI wants Apple to unlock Farook's iPhone.

""The cases are different, but the underlying legal question is very similar,"" says Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The question in the New York case is whether the government can rely on this very old statute to conscript Apple into government service.""

There are some key differences between the two cases. The defendant's iPhone in New York was using an older operating system, iOS 7, which makes it relatively easy for Apple to unlock the phone. The iPhone in California is running Apple's newer operating system, iOS 9, and the company says it would have to create software just to unlock it.

Abdo says that's a conscious choice by Apple.

""They didn't want to be in the position, they told the court, of having to serve as a government investigative agent,"" he says. ""They wanted to be out of the business of spying on their customers.""

That may be especially important to Apple in international markets, where security is a big selling point. But U.S. law enforcement is frustrated by that argument. Federal prosecutors say Apple is putting its own public relations interests ahead of national security.

They think Apple could easily unlock the phones in California and Brooklyn  just like it's done 70 times before.","['doj', 'wanted', 'apple', 'writs', 'company', 'argument', 'brooklyn', 'seeds', 'iphone', 'sown', 'unlock', 'apples', 'judge', 'law', 'public', 'standoff']"
npr,,"Reminder: If The Facts Dont Support Someones Claim, Say That",[],"Reminder: If The Facts Dont Support Someones Claim, Say That

We wrote about this last month. The New York Times public editor weighed in this week. Its worth repeating:

When politicians and public officials (or anyone, for that matter) say things that dont fit the facts, we should point it out  and we are, as the Break It Down fact-checks show.

Our earlier post suggested several ways to say and write that what Candidate A or City Official B just said doesnt stand up to scrutiny. The Times Margaret Sullivan pointed to other approaches, such as noting that they spoke without citing any evidence or that the statement has no basis in fact.

If the evidence shows that a claim clearly doesnt add up, we dont need to qualify with a critics contend or a some say. State what is known and how weve reached that conclusion (for example, an NPR search of news accounts and police records found no evidence to support the claim).

Sullivan also noted something we agree with: that as much as possible, the fact-checking should be done in real time. That is, as soon as possible after a claim is made. Weve been doing that very effectively after the presidential debates and notable claims by candidates.

Obviously, politicians and public officials arent the only people who make claims that cant be substantiated. Keep in mind that, as the Ethics Handbook says, our purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical. We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism are both correct and in context. Also, we shouldnt just spread information. Be careful and skeptical.

""These are just the strongest melodies and the strongest ideas that occurred to me over a three to four year period, distilled.""

That's the great violinist, lyricist and singer Andrew Bird on the subject of a project he's excited though a bit apprehensive talking about, his new album Are You Serious. That album, which comes out on April 1, is the most personal album he's ever made. Andrew Bird's lyrics are often a kind of cryptic code, wordplay about the human condition, but on Are You Serious he reveals more about his own life including a blossoming relationship between two relative introverts and the birth of their son.

In our conversation, we hear excerpts of four songs from Are You Serious and dive into the process of writing and playing with his extraordinary band, which includes Blake Mills on guitar, Ted Poor on drums and Alan Hampton on bass. The record also includes Fiona Apple playing a romantic in a duet with Bird the skeptic.

Here's the album's opening track, ""Capsized."" You can hear the whole interview above, and read highlights below.

Interview Highlights:

On writing a song you can play forever:

""I think the reason it ['Capsized'] has this staying power, there are just a few songs in your lifetime that can do this, where you can play them every night and it doesn't feel like you're being penned in by the music. It changes because you feel different as a person from one hour to the next throughout the day and it's rare to have a song that can change with you. Sometimes certain things come out of me that I don't expect and it just adapts to how I feel. And that's how I felt at that moment.""

toggle caption

On how falling in love and marriage changes the way he writes:

""Knowing that you're going to be with someone for a long time definitely changes [the way you write], often because you're sitting in the same room with them as you're writing, and when you're sitting on the couch and you know it's not going to last, you might ... have to ... encrypt ... things. And when you don't have to do that anymore it might change your writing in that sense.""

On producer Tony Berg, and how he used pictures to help he crafted ""Valleys of the Young"":

""He kept pulling up images of the Dust Bowl, of those many-mile high storms going across the plains, in Oklahoma, in the thirties, and what inspired Woody Guthire to write, 'So Long, It's Been Good To Know Ya.' He would point to that and say, 'I want it to sound like that!' And that is a little more abstract as opposed to voice leadings and all the geeky theory stuff; that's more in the category of lighting candles and incense, and setting a mood. But it was good to have a visual. I wanted it ['Valleys of the Young'] to be noisy; I wanted it to be kind of like a Sonic Youth track but a little more like a pop song at the same time.""

On ""Chemical Switches"" and how he writes to a melody:

""This started off as an instrumental, what I thought was a really strong melody. And I think when I really want to just sing that melody, the words really have to serve the shape of the melody, which is the way I would write a lot in the past. So it's definitely more impressionistic; it's based on personal experiences but it's not quite as obvious.""","['song', 'personal', 'youre', 'andrew', 'writing', 'write', 'going', 'way', 'serious', 'melody', 'gets', 'really', 'bird', 'songs']"

There have been times in recent weeks when potentially offensive language  bleeped, thankfully  was broadcast without a discussion beforehand with senior editors. Thats disturbing given the number of reminders that have gone out concerning such language and our policy. It should not happen.

Hopefully the points that follow are clear:

1. We have a detailed Policy On Use Of Potentially Offensive Language. Print it and read it.

2. Any clip with offensive language must be brought to the attention of the DMEs well before air time. Basically, as soon as you think you might be using it, talk to them. They may need time to consult with Legal.

Note: It does not matter if the words have already been bleeped. Be prepared to justify their use. a. By the way, its assumed show executive producers and desk chiefs will already have been consulted.

b. The standards & practices editor should also be flagged.

3. The DMEs have yea-or-nay authority.

4. DACs lines must tell stations the specific language that is in the cut, when it occurs and whether it is bleeped. Those lines must go out with as much lead time as we can give.

5. If the words are bleeped, they must be completely bleeped. No syllable can be heard.

6. We do all this because we respect our audience and know that certain language will offend many. We also know that community standards vary around the nation and that complaints to the FCC can be costly to our member stations.

7. Overall, NPR is conservative about potentially offensive language  not permissive. Theres a key line right at the top of our policy statement: NPR has always set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive to our audience. The words must be important to the piece.

Questions? See Chuck, Gerry or me.

npr,,Iron Council,[],"Excerpt: Iron Council

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

Whos at the organic smoothie shop? Pat or Korva? Whos the she? When will she get back with that smoothie?

We offer this presumably fictional and rather convoluted sentence because many of us arent careful about making sure that the pronouns we use are clearly connected to the antecedents they replace. Editors see antecedent/pronoun problems in copy every day.

Lets pick apart the opening scene. This is what was happening:

 Korva wanted the car started at 3:07 a.m., not 3:05.

 Pat was at the organic smoothie shop getting Korvas Mango/Kale/Chia Supreme.

 Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her about the new starting time.

Strunk and Whites The Elements of Style offers this advice: The relative pronoun should come, in most instances, immediately after its antecedent. Note, for instance, how much clearer it reads to say Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her. Just four small words separate the antecedent from the pronoun. Its clear that Pat is her.

Please also take care to pair singular pronouns with singular antecedents and plurals with plurals. Gender agreement is important as well, but bear in mind that the choice of pronoun may be a sensitive issue when the subject is a transgender person.

Looking at crimes from a different angle has become something of a trope these days  The Girl on the Train, anyone?

However, clever though Paula Hawkins' novel was, modern writers did not invent the alternate perspective. Think Rear Window, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Rebecca. Murder does make voyeurs of us all (as Hamlet didn't quite say).

The ultimate voyeur may be the reporter. Fiona Barton spent years writing for Britain's Daily Mail and Telegraph newspapers, and her journalistic eye is what makes this debut novel so assured and compelling. This is no small feat, given that both the crime and the death of the man convicted of it happen by page three, leaving several narrators to fill readers in on the backstory and its loose threads.

Glen Taylor was taken into custody for the abduction and disappearance of a toddler named Bella. The charges officially dismissed, he returns home to the semi-detached where his wife Jean has remained, despite being shunned by the community that knows Glen's computer contained evidence of his sexual predilections. ""No one wanted to know us now,"" says Jean. ""They just wanted to know about us.""

Had he but lived, Glen Taylor's might have become a familiar story: The shadowy, creepy neighbor who rarely goes out and isn't trusted around anyone's children. When he's run over by a bus, however, a London reporter and a local detective realize Jean Taylor's side of the story is up for grabs.

Their pursuit of Jean's tale propels The Widow, but its strength rests on her bowed shoulders. ""Must be a reporter,"" she says when Kate Waters from the Daily Post shows up. ""I bet she says 'I'm sorry to bother you at such a difficult time.' They all say that and put on that stupid face. Like they care."" Kate ""seems to be in charge of things,"" Jean muses. ""It's quite nice to have someone in charge of me again. I was beginning to think I'd have to cope with everything on my own.""

Barton, a seasoned reporter herself, understands the power of previously silent voice, as well as the frustration involved when that voice won't speak up. Bella is still missing, and her mother galvanizes a campaign to find her that puts pressure on the police and media. Some of the book's best moments illuminate how stressful it is to solve a case: Kate's constant travel and nights in hotel rooms, or Detective Inspector Bob Sparkes attempting to have a simple supper with his wife.

Kate may be manipulating Jean to get her story, but Jean has her own agenda; she's manipulating Kate right back. Their psychological fan dance winds up more obscene than anything on Glen Taylor's hard drive, as it delays discovery of the truth  and Barton shows that anguish by including chapters from the perspective of Bella Taylor's mother, Dawn.

A few critics have noted that Barton tips her hand too soon. While that might be a first-time novelist's mistake, it might also be the deliberate work of a professional observer who knows that the lies we tell ourselves can be more devastating than those we tell others.

It is also no longer necessary to include the reminder about the name Burma in every report. Use your judgment. In longer pieces, and especially in those tracing the countrys recent history, an also known as Burma is appropriate and helpful.

Meanwhile, our guidance (and APs) has been that Myanmarese is the adjective to use when describing the people of that country. You should know, however, that there is disagreement over whether that is the proper adjectival form and that people in Myanmar do not refer to themselves that way.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says last month was the warmest January on record. That sets off alarm bells for climate scientists, but for the average person living in a northern climate, it might not sound so bad.

That's what many people are saying these days in Russia, where the expected icy winter has failed to materialize this year  to widespread joy. Of course, any climate scientist will tell you that an unusually warm month  or even a whole warm winter  doesn't mean much. It's the long-term trend that counts.

But that's not how it appears to the popular imagination, says George Safonov, who heads the Center for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. He says there's a big temptation in northern countries to believe that warmer weather can bring economic opportunities, such as improving conditions for farming.

""Before 2010, we had a rising harvest rate for crops, and that was explained as a very positive impact of climate change,"" he says. ""It was not easy to convince people that this is not correct.""

The problem, Safonov says, is that while warmer weather might open up more land in cold regions such as Siberia, it's already causing havoc on existing farmland in the south.

Some of Russia's most productive farmland, the fertile steppes around Rostov-on-Don, has been facing a series of droughts.

""We had one-third of all harvests lost in 2010, one-fourth of all crops lost in 2012. And if you calculate, that was about $12 -$15 billion damage,"" he says. In other words, a huge loss for Russian farmers.

We went to the Rostov region to see what farmers are doing about all this.

There's nothing growing there now, but driving through the miles of plowed fields, you can see why this area is called the breadbasket of Russia.

The writer Anton Chekhov said it was so fertile, you could poke a stick into the ground and it would take root and grow.

Vladimir Dvornik runs an agricultural cooperative called Progress, a former Soviet collective farm. He says he and his fellow growers have had to change their crops to deal with drier conditions.

""We gave up growing some kinds of grain, soy and some vegetables, like peppers and tomatoes,"" Dvornik says. Now, he says he has switched to winter wheat and other crops that do well in drier weather.

He says it's not a catastrophe for local growers, because they've had time to adapt, but drought could cause severe problems if it keeps getting warmer.

As for moving Russian farming to Siberia, Dvornik says that's nonsense, and so does economist Safonov.

There's no infrastructure for farming there, Safonov says, no expertise and no population of potential farm workers. Between losing farmland in the south, and starting large-scale farming in the north, the costs would be huge.

""Overall, I would estimate these potential losses as a few dozens of billions of dollars per year if we don't do anything,"" Safonov says.","['great', 'farmland', 'nyet', 'winter', 'farmers', 'crops', 'climate', 'weather', 'safonov', 'dvornik', 'russian', 'farming', 'change']"

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

 Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

npr,,The Charlie Hebdo Cartoons And NPRs Decision Not To Publish Them,[],"The Charlie Hebdo Cartoons And NPRs Decision Not To Publish Them

The attack on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and the murders of its cartoonists meant editors at NPR and other news organizations needed to decide which, if any, of the magazines cartoons they should publish.

In a Two-Way blog post and during a conversation on Weekend Edition Saturday, NPRs thinking was discussed. The key points behind the decision not to post the magazines most controversial, and potentially most offensive, cartoons included:

 Photos showing just a few of the magazines covers could lead viewers to mistakenly conclude that Charlie Hebdo is only a bit edgier than other satirical publications. But a comprehensive display of Charlie Hebdos work would require posting images that go well beyond most news organizations standards regarding offensive material. At NPR, the policy on potentially offensive language applies to the images posted online as well. It begins by stating that as a responsible broadcaster, NPR has always set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive to our audience. 

 No news organization could seriously say that it doesnt think about the safety of its journalists, when these cartoons might have been the cause for the firebombing of Charlie Hebdos offices a few years back and the murder of its staff this week. But, were journalists. Were willing to take risks. We know that sometimes well have to. Editorially, we just didnt think that we could post enough of the images to give you a sense of what the magazine was really like. If you only put a few, it might look like it was just little bit edgier than MAD magazine, and thats just not the case.

Peering back across Harper Lee's life, it can seem impossible to distinguish the novelist from her masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee died at the age of 89 in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala., on Friday morning  yet it's clear that her legacy will live on much longer than that, through her characters and the readers who have embraced them for decades.

""America and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century's most beloved authors,"" Hank Conner, Lee's nephew, announced in a statement. ""We knew her as Nelle Harper Lee, a loving member of our family, a devoted friend to the many good people who touched her life, and a generous soul in our community and our state.""

Conner's experience, though  and the experiences of those who knew Lee personally  are exceptional. For the most part, Lee's readers have known the author only through To Kill a Mockingbird, her debut  and, for decades, her only  novel.

The book depicts the strivings of a small-town Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch, on behalf of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with raping a white woman, and it casts the events through the lens of Finch's precocious daughter, Scout. Despite its relative brevity, the book bears considerable weight, both in the gravity of its themes and the care with which it treats them.

toggle caption AP

Perhaps, then, it should be no surprise that Lee and her editor, Tay Hohoff, weren't exactly expecting this book to fly off store shelves.

Hohoff ""cautioned her that a book with racism at its center involving a rape trial was not a thing in 1960 to make people run to the bookstores for,"" says Charles J. Shields, author of Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee. ""She counselled her client and said, 'If we sell 2,500 copies and break even, you should be proud.' ""

You already know this twist: Turns out they were flat wrong.

The book all but immediately became a best-seller. (And it's gone on to sell more than 40 million copies, according to The Washington Post.) It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. Just a year later, it was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film.

What accounts for that kind of success? In many ways, it struck a chord for the very reasons Lee's editor was feeling cautious, says Mary Murphy, director of the documentary Hey, Boo: Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird.

""You know, there were two big revolutions in the '60s in this country when To Kill a Mockingbird came out: One was civil rights and the other was women's rights. And in a way, To Kill a Mockingbird speaks to both those things,"" Murphy says.

""Scout Finch at 6 enjoyed, as child growing up in the Depression, enjoyed more freedoms than most women in the '60s did. She wore pants, she swore, she played with boys, she spoke her mind,"" Murphy continues. ""And of course the Civil Rights movement: Many people I spoke to who were active in the movement said that the fact that a white Southerner wrote that book gave them hope that justice could prevail.""

And then, seemingly all at once, Lee was gone  at least, that's how the popular narrative goes. The author quietly continued to write, but she decided to step out of the spotlight. Lee did not publish another novel for more than five decades, and she refused nearly every attempt by the press to speak with her.

Naturally, there grew around her the mythology of the reclusive writer. It's a myth that Murphy says simply isn't true.

""Harper Lee was not a recluse. She was not holed up in her house like Boo Radley  unless of course, you were a reporter, and then she was not going to talk to you,"" Murphy says. ""I think that's a big distinction.""

Wayne Flynt, her friend and professor emeritus at Auburn University, says her absence had little to do with preconceived notions of her personality.

""Many people describe her as an introvert, many people explain her as being extremely shy, she was neither an introvert nor shy,"" Flynt says. ""She was a private woman, she lived very much within herself, she was quite content within herself.""

And he explains Lee's decision not to publish again  for decades  quite simply.

""I suppose what I would say is that there are some writers who have one great story to tell and they tell that one great story.""

In the meantime, that singular novel was becoming a staple on high school syllabi, a beloved text read and reread even as its era passed on into the next, and new generations picked up the book.

""The people who have To Kill a Mockingbird seared in memory  their first reading experience of To Kill a Mockingbird seared in their brain  it's the biggest book club in the world,"" Murphy says. ""I mean, for all our conversations about Facebook and social media, To Kill a Mockingbird is the biggest social media group of our time, in a way.""

Lee was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work in 2007, and a National Medal of Arts in 2010.

Then, the second twist: Last year, after some 55 years of waiting, Lee decided it was time to publish a second novel, Go Set a Watchman. The book was initially billed by many as a sequel to Mockingbird, for it shared principal characters, reviving Atticus and Scout in a setting several years later than Mockingbird's main action.

toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images

Yet, in many ways, it was less a sequel than a glimpse at what would have been, had Lee gone with her first impulses a writer rather than following her editor's advice and reworking her first drafts. For years, Hohoff had worked with Lee on radical revisions to the text, from 1957 to the book's eventual publication in 1960, according to The New York Times.

""I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told,"" Lee said in a 2015 statement.

Go Set a Watchman, then, let Lee's early visions of her definitive work find the light of day. In the process, though, it also invited significant skepticism that Lee, who had suffered a stroke in 2007, was fully in control of the decision.

Then, there were the decidedly mixed reviews.

""All I know for certain is that Go Set a Watchman is kind of a mess that will forever change the way we read a masterpiece,"" NPR's Maureen Corrigan, for one, wrote about the book when it was released in July 2015. Her assessment was by no means uncommon.

Lee's own reaction to the reviews and the controversy?

""She chortled,"" Flynt told AL.com at the time.

And herein, perhaps, rests a lesson: Despite our best attempts to confine Lee's life to the pages she wrote and the characters she created, her own life far exceeded the bounds of her book covers. Lee was more than Atticus, Scout and Tom; she was more than the author of To Kill a Mockingbird. And, perhaps, she often remembered that fact much better than the rest of us.

""She was a good companion,"" Flynt remembers. ""She had lots of people she adored.

""One thing I will say about Harper Lee: If you ever met Harper Lee, you got just exactly what you saw. She never tried to be anything her entire life except who she was.""","['life', 'lee', 'shaped', 'harper', 'text', 'mockingbird', 'murphy', 'caption', 'lees', 'book', 'kill', 'measure', 'towering', 'previous', 'twoway', 'npr']"

i toggle caption Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images

At pretty much any Lady Gaga performance, you can count on spectacle: whirling lights, elaborate sets and many, many costume changes. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different  except that she was deploying her famous pipes in the service of another artist's music. As she pinballed through David Bowie's catalog in a career-spanning tribute to the late icon, it was a reminder that the 29-year-old Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her hero. After six Grammys of her own, a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel, duets with Tony Bennett, a Super Bowl national anthem and one very famous meat dress, there appears to be little that the woman born Stefani Germanotta cannot do.

And yet, she recently surprised herself. Alongside veteran hitmaker Diane Warren, Gaga co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the 2015 film The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses. The track is up for an Oscar, but the bigger breakthrough is a personal one. Like Warren, Gaga is a survivor of sexual assault, and says the decision to work on the song didn't come easily  but that once it was out there, stories from other survivors came flooding in, some prefaced with the admission that they'd never felt comfortable sharing their experiences until now.

Lady Gaga joined NPR's Michel Martin from New York to talk about songwriting that hits close to home, how artists and fans benefit from mutual support, and what David Bowie meant to her as a teenager gazing on the cover of Aladdin Sane for the first time. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below.

Michel Martin: I want to start off by talking about ""Til It Happens to You,"" which is nominated for an Oscar. I know it's not easy to talk about, but may I ask how you came to be involved in this project?

Lady Gaga: ""Til It Happens to You"" is something that has come out of a group of women coming together, who decided that they wanted to make a change. And that's me and Diane Warren and Bonnie [Greenberg], who was the music supervisor. When we first started talking, I was really not sure what to do. I have a very uncomfortable relationship with this topic because it's so personal to me, and I didn't know if I was ready to be a part of it. And as soon as I met Diane and she started to talk to me about what she wanted to do, I knew that I had to be brave, and I had to help tell this story to the world.

So, Diane and I met in New York City. She played me this song idea that she had started, and I immediately started crying. I was really unsure, even in that moment, if I was going to be able to do it. And she said, ""Well, I want you to make it your own. I want it to be something that you feel connected to."" And we started to change the song together  make it something that reflected both of our experiences with sexual assault. I guess it's a long story, but what I'm trying to say is that it's a quite complicated one. And it starts with me, when I was a young girl: I had this traumatic experience, and it's sort of coming full circle now, and really ending in a way for me, as I'm healing from it in writing this song with Diane.

Have other artists come to you since you recorded this song to talk about this issue? It just seems as though a number of people in your industry have had similar experiences and didn't talk about it for years, or ever.

Yeah, there are. I wouldn't reveal names of anyone that came to me personally to express that they had been through something similar. But there's a lot of people, men and women all over the world, who have experienced sexual assault not only on campuses and not only in the music industry, but within their own families and within their own relationships. It has been kind of overwhelming for both Diane and I, the amount of letters and people on the street that stop us to talk about this song and to tell us how much it means to them. I've had reporters tell me about their experiences with sexual assault in interviews, and they've told me, ""I've never ever told anyone that but you."" You know, that's a powerful thing to witness.

As an artist, and also through your foundation, you've worked on some really raw and emotionally complex issues. Given that you have a voice you can use to elevate a topic, how do you decide what you want to talk about?

Well, I always have been an activist for things that were just authentically a part of my life, that I felt connected to. In terms of my involvement in ""don't ask, don't tell"" and marriage equality and anti-bullying and social emotional learning in schools  these are all things that arise out of my relationship with the world and with my fans. I listen to them, I meet with them, they write me letters; I'm in tune with what people want to change in the world, and I want to be a part of moving that forward. I just genuinely feel that that's what you do when you're an artist: You stick up for the people around you.

I imagine that's draining, emotionally and physically. How do you manage that work and still do all the other things you do?

I guess I don't really think about it that way, you know? This thing that I do with caring about the message in my music, it's not separate from my work as a commercial artist; they're totally one and the same. I'm always going to be thinking about what my voice means. When I was 22, putting out my first couple records, I was a baby  and nobody really views you as any type of role model or anything. But as you get older, you realize that you have the attention of a lot of young people. And you think, ""OK, well, what should I say now? What can I say that will be impactful in a positive way?""

You know, just bringing it back to ""Til It Happens To You"": What happened to me happened 10 years ago. And then I became famous like overnight, it felt like, and I never really had time to deal with my issues. As soon as you start to make money selling your music, there's a lot of people around you that are very excited about what you have to offer financially to business, and they start to maybe forget that there's a person underneath all of that. [So] my team now, they spend every day making sure that I am healthy and happy and that I am able to focus on the things that I love.

We have to talk about David Bowie and your tribute to him at the Grammys this year. He's somebody you've been compared to in some ways: constantly reimagining yourself, testing the boundaries of presentation. Your performance actually used computer graphics to draw his famous lightning bolt on your face as you sang. How did you get to this point?

Well, the moment that I saw the Aladdin Sane cover for the first time, I was 19 years old, and it just changed my perspective on everything, forever. It was an image that changed my life. I remember I took the vinyl record out of the casing and I put it on my vinyl player  which was on my stovetop in my kitchen, because I was living in this really tiny apartment and I had my turntable on my stove. ""Watch That Man"" came on and, I mean, that was just the beginning of my artistic birth. I started to dress more expressively. I started to go to the library and look through more art books. I took an art history class. I was playing with a band.

I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, my friends and I in New York, we've lived a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology since we were kids  and this is because of him. I just would never be here, or have the philosophy that I have, if I didn't have someone to look up to that you know blew my mind so intensely. You know the way that Nile Rodgers talks about Coltrane, and the way that Coltrane makes him think about jazz? That's how David Bowie is for me. You meet or see a musician that has something that is of another planet, of another time, and it changes you forever. I believe everyone has that, don't you? That one thing you saw as a kid that made you go, ""Oh, okay. Now I know who I am.""

How do you feel now that the tribute is over? I mean, it had to come together so quickly, and it was so complex and had so many layers to it.

How do I feel now that it's over? I mean, I feel like my whole career is a tribute to David Bowie.

So it's not! It's ongoing, right?

It's still going. I've been watching his videos all day long, and also listening to Blackstar, his last album, which is a truly incredible piece of music. It's one of the single greatest things an artist has ever done: making a masterpiece album that is their own eulogy. Can you imagine? To go into the studio every day and put your heart in that place, where you are saying goodbye to life? I mean, his art made him strong.","['brave', 'bowie', 'started', 'things', 'song', 'david', 'gaga', 'know', 'music', 'thats', 'lady', 'talk', 'really']"

Speaking anonymously because he doesnt want to be drummed out of the Noodge Union, an NPR editor said it felt fine, given the spirit of the story.

When Franz Liszt wrote The Fountains of the Villa d'Este, he added a Latin quotation from the Gospel of St. John. It says: ""But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life."" That composition is featured on the newest album by French pianist Helene Grimaud, called Water.

Because that's the theme of the album: The pieces she plays are all, somehow, connected to water. Like Luciano Berio's piece Wasserklavier, or ""Water Piano."" In between the pieces that Grimaud plays on piano  all unaccompanied  there are are transitions composed by Nitin Sawhney, a British Indian musician and producer.

Grimaud joined NPR's Robert Siegel to talk about the inspiration behind the project and the best way to listen to it. Hear the radio version at the audio link and read their conversation below.

How do you describe your intent, the intent behind this project, Water?

It started, I have to say, simply because of the beauty of this repertoire. There are so many pieces written in the name of water, and with water in mind, as a source of inspiration. But the idea was to also bring it to the forefront of our consciousness as not only a source of inspiration but as a source of life. And not only as a metaphor but as a molecule, which stands for rebirth and regeneration. And if you look at the statistics today they're absolutely scary. One child dies every 90 seconds from a disease contracted by consuming impure water. You know, it's a musical exploration but hopefully also an artistic invitation to a prise de conscience, we say in French, some greater ecological awareness.

For you, what's the difference between creating an album that is so strongly thematic and say, recording an album that's two great Beethoven pieces or two great Brahms concertos?

[Laughs.] It's a very good question. There is no difference. I mean, they're both equally important and intense. And yes, the conceptual nature of this album made it a particularly wonderful and stimulating adventure. You know, for me, they're all babies I cherish equally, so there is no hierarchy based on the experimental nature of a more conceptual project.

One fact of making an album like this is that the album  the selections, the transitions between them  is the form of presentation. That's how we hear this. And yet we live in an age of shuffle mode, and different songs coming to us in all sorts of different orders. In a way, the challenge you face is: Will people just listen to your disc through, start to finish?

I certainly hope they will because it is a journey and you have to give that journey a chance. This is very subtle, very fragile, vulnerable music and you need to give it a chance to develop. It's not a program that makes a strong statement from the get-go, so you need to let it take you by the hand. But you have to be open-minded, openhearted for that.

Now it can be certainly consumed in any way; I mean, the beauty of these pieces is that they are so fantastic that they stand alone. At the same time, I would find it a shame if one didn't experience the journey from beginning to end, with that overarching structure and line running through.","['album', 'motivation', 'metaphor', 'inspiration', 'theyre', 'water', 'source', 'say', 'journey', 'grimauds', 'helene', 'way', 'pieces', 'thats']"

Here's a puzzle: Put two quarters side by side so the ridges mesh like gears, then hold one still and roll the other all the way around it. How many revolutions will George Washington make?

That's a riddle from Ethan Canin's new novel, A Doubter's Almanac. The book follows Milo Andret, a troubled math genius, through three generations of his family. Canin tells NPR's Ari Shapiro about his protagonist's Michigan childhood, and the answer to the book's two quarter puzzle.

Interview Highlights

On Milo as a child deciding to make a chain out of a fallen tree

He's a kid growing up in the woods of northern Michigan  kind of a lonely kid in these lonely woods  and a giant beech tree falls over one night in a storm. And he goes out there, looks at it and gets this idea that he could whittle a chain out of the wood.

[Shapiro: And to make a chain out of a fallen tree you can't do link by link, it has to be all interlinked and you just take away everything but the chain.]

Yeah, that's exactly right. It's kind of the way Michelangelo used to sculpt and imagine everything that wasn't the Pieta. And that's what this guy does: He spends the entire summer building this unbuildable thing, whittling this unwhittlable chain. And it becomes a metaphor for what he does with the rest of his life, really, which is try to solve the unsolvable problem.

On how Milo becomes a mathematician

He turns out to have a couple of skills. One of them is that he can always tell where he is on the Earth  he has this internal compass that some people have. And later on in his life, he discovers that he can also draw very beautifully in an idiot's way  not understanding exactly what he's drawing, yet able to render everything perfectly. And those kinds of talents sort of sweep him forward into this life he didn't intend to have, which is a life as a mathematician working on one of the great unsolved problems of the century.

That puzzle puzzles the daylights out of me. It's fantastic.

On mathematicians and mental illness

Mathematicians don't like it when they're associated with, you know, with mental illness. And I can see why they don't. ... A lot of mathematicians are sort of bristled when people say that they can't get along socially, that they're not good with people. But I look around the world; I think it seems to be fairly true.

On the answer to the riddle about the two quarters

Well, come on, every smart person in the world would say one  the circumference of one coin matches the circumference of the other. But it's not. It goes around twice, right? And you could prove that by taking two quarters out of your pocket. ...

That puzzle puzzles the daylights out of me. It's fantastic.","['life', 'way', 'chain', 'author', 'canin', 'tree', 'doubters', 'theyre', 'woods', 'ethan', 'almanac', 'world', 'milo', 'troubled', 'puzzle']"

When you think of tract homes, you think of houses that look the same: the same color scheme, the same style; homes that form two uninteresting walls on either side of a suburban street. That might be the case today, but nearly 60 years ago  at a time when ""real"" architects wouldn't touch tract homes  one architect did everything he could to break the monotony. His name is William Krisel, and he's being honored by a place whose look he helped define  Palm Springs, Calif.

The minute you see Krisel's homes, you're taken back to another era. They have distinctive angled roofs, high windows and desert color schemes with pops of rich gold or vibrant blue. They also have lots of glass and elegantly simple lines, a signature of all the houses in the city's Twin Palms tract neighborhood. One of those homes belongs to Heidi Creighton, and she knows just what she has. She says it's ""a Krisel-designed home, and it would be classified as a Model A-3 sunflap flat-roof tract house.""

Sitting in Creighton's living room, if you didn't see the flat screen TV, you'd swear it was 1962. The couch is angular and low to the ground. The wooden coffee table is kidney-shaped and rests on spindle legs. On an end table, there are glasses, a cocktail shaker and olive picks in their own stand.

""If you walked into my house,"" Creighton says, ""you would see a light-infused, glass house with very little distinction between the inside and the outside of the house. Materials are simple, and you're happy to be here. It feels good.""

In other words, it's consummate William Krisel. At 91, the architect himself lives in a condo in Beverly Hills with his wife of more than 60 years. Naturally, the condo is in a building he designed.

""At one point in my practice, of the 10 largest homebuilders in the United States, seven of the 10 were my clients,"" Krisel says. ""And I have had built, from my designs, over 40,000 living units, and that's more than any other architect that I know of.""

While his work is spread across the West, his Palm Springs houses proved that modernism could be livable and affordable. He notably designed several housing tracts for the Alexander Construction Co., which appreciated the way the homes could be built economically and with almost assembly-line efficiency.

Back in Twin Palms, around the corner from Heidi Creighton's house lives realtor Chris Menrad. Sitting poolside in the backyard of his agave-green house with a roof resembling the swoop of a check mark, he echoes Creighton's enthusiasm for the architect's design.

""There's a very big connection with the outdoors,"" Menrad says. ""There's lots of windows, lots of clerestory windows, so you're always kind of looking up and out, and you're always aware of what's going on outside, or weather  sunlight.""

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

Both Menrad and Creighton, who co-edited a new book on the architect, are picking up on the language of modernism. Like any language, Krisel says, it has basic tenets: ""that a house is more than just a shelter; that it is a way of improving your way of life; that it can open up a whole new concept in your feeling every day; that the indoors and the outdoors are inseparable; and that the climate and the flora and fauna and ecology are all encompassed in making your decisions on how to create this space.""

Krisel is also a landscape architect, so he had control over all design aspects. Plants were selected for shape and color; paint schemes and rooflines were varied so no two were too close together; and he varied the setbacks on each house to break the uninterrupted wall of homes found in most tract developments.

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

But despite this meticulous attention to detail, many still considered them just tract homes. ""He was definitely sort of forgotten,"" Menrad says. In 1999, when Menrad began restoring his house, he was the exception. Now, Krisel says houses he designed throughout the Coachella Valley are being snapped up.

""One by one, I could find a house that somebody had restored properly, and then another one,"" he says. ""And now it's like a virus. Everybody in Palm Springs wants to do it.""

Actually, they've been fans for a while. For the past decade, the city has celebrated its architectural heritage during Modernism Week. At this year's event, it's renaming a street in honor of the once-overlooked 91-year-old architect.","['homes', 'caption', 'house', 'masses', 'darren', 'modernism', 'helped', 'bring', 'toggle', 'architect', 'krisel', 'tract', 'meet', 'bradleycourtesy', 'menrad']"

Sometimes you want your history close to home. It's a good thing, then, that Ruth Goodman seriously commits to her research. In How to Be a Tudor, billed as ""a dawn-to-dusk guide to Tudor life,"" she recounts her experiences with lower- and middle-class daily habits, including Elizabethan hygiene regimens (not bad), rush-mat floors (quite nice), roasting meat on a spit (spectacular) and attempting to plow fields for planting (sad trombone).

This isn't the first time Goodman has immersed herself in a bygone era; she previously tackled the 19th century in How to Be a Victorian. For those hoping for an identical experience, How to Be a Tudor doesn't quite reach the same breadth of detail that went into How to Be a Victorian. Then again, that's no surprise, given that the literacy rates of Tudor England hit a maximum of about 30 percent, and documentation is trickier to come by  and that's before you start looking for genetically accurate manchet wheat to make your period-correct bread.

In fact, Goodman's Tudor research sounds like detective work as much as anything, from sorting out the proper bookkeeping allocations for shirts in tradesmen's wills to figuring out the invisible steps left out of advice manuals in their instructions for making cheese. But what you lose in extant documentation, you gain in the visceral detail that comes with hands-on experience. Her description of an Elizabethan suit of clothes is positively breathless, and tracing the amount of work that went into making even a modest Tudor meal is enough to make you want a nap by proxy.

The rush floors might be obsolete, but the crucial importance of ephemeral etiquette and the social panic about those who aimed above their station haven't changed at all. Scholars even released pamphlets scolding the youth on the bawdy language of their popular songs; if that doesn't make the past come alive, nothing will.

Given the mountains of scholarship on the high-stakes political landscape of the era, How to Be a Tudor wisely skips most of the court intrigue. Goodman instead concentrates on laws that touch on day-to-day life, each of which echoes larger concerns about scarcity, social climbing, sexual expression and global trade. Sumptuary laws prevented men of a lower class from wearing certain kinds of fur or forbade the purchase of imported cloth in order to boost local economies; licensing laws worked to prevent widows from turning their living rooms into alehouses, or to protect brothels from constabulary scrutiny. (And every detail matters  London had a brothel licensed by the Bishop of Winchester until 1546, which speaks volumes about the relationship between church and state, the role of prostitution in urbanization and how effectively the plague could shut down a business.)

This sense of the past mapped over the present isn't touched on overmuch by Goodman herself; she's here to demystify the past, with only occasional threads drawn directly to the modern day. (There aren't even many illustrations; in this book, the ways in which people spoke about dancing and the flow of energy through an evening is more important than an actual map of steps.) But at some point, reading about the everyday minutiae of the past ceases becoming a list of the ways Then is different from Now, and just becomes a list of malleable human follies that are separated more by wishful thinking than by anything else. The rush floors might be obsolete, but the crucial importance of ephemeral etiquette and the social panic about those who aimed above their station haven't changed at all. Scholars even released pamphlets scolding the youth on the bawdy language of their popular songs; if that doesn't make the past come alive, nothing will.

And at heart, How to Be a Tudor wants nothing more than that. Engagingly written and awash in the practicalities of life in the age, it presents a vivid, fascinating era of British history and reminds us that we're never as far from the past as we like to think.

Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher is not just the greatest American food writer who's ever played the game, she's one of our greatest writers, period. She was, variously, a travel writer, an essayist, a chronicler of American idylls, an observer of decline, of lack, of old fashioned custom and manners, a social critic, and a historian. The food thing? That's just what she loved  the fixed point around which she structured so much of her life (both the writing side of it and the actual living side of it) and to which she paid such particular and loving attention.

No one working in the English language has ever written about food quite the same way Fisher did. No one ever will. It's something to do with voice (the way her sentences breathe, the unconscious lulls and the very conscious focus shifts as she observes the reactions of people around the table to this or that little edible thing) and something to do with the way she witnessed life (as the things that happen between meals). But her truest power was in her ability to capture the feel of an American somnolence and the pause bought by even the simplest meals; the break with reality born of sitting at a table, with friends or without, and being forced, briefly, to contend only with the sensual and the sustaining.

The Theoretical Foot is no different. It is a roman a clef, lifting details, characters, locations and events from the latter days of the romance between Fisher (cast as Sara Porter on the page) and the artist and writer Dillwyn ""Tim"" Parrish (Tim Garton here). The novel itself never saw publication while Fisher was alive. It was submitted, rejected and sat for decades in the files of her long-time agent while she went on to make a career as a non-fiction writer. It is rescued here, now, only because she is M.F.K. Fisher. Because who that knows her wouldn't want another M.F.K. Fisher book?

In real life, the two of them  Fisher and Parrish  met while married to other people and fell hard for each other. Together they would go to Paris and, later, would live together in Switzerland (even though they were not yet married which was clutch-your-pearls scandalous at the time), in a house that overlooked Lake Geneva. It was full of friends and food and, looking back, must've seemed like a moment of perfection to Fisher because soon enough Parrish would develop Buerger's Disease and would have his left leg amputated (giving the book its title). The disease was incurable. Parrish spent his remaining days in immense pain. Within three years, he would commit suicide.

Admirably, The Theoretical Foot deals with both poles  the perfect nothingness, lightness and frivolity of the days before tragedy, and the squirming aftermath. There is, for the bulk of the book, nothing more consequential happening on any given page than someone lighting a cigarette, trying on clothes or laying down for a nap. Characters pass in and out of rooms, watch each other, judge and are judged. Drinks are taken  cold beers, gin and bitters, brandy as a curative for literally anything from hayfever to a sick cat  and lunch is served. Each meal is an opportunity for Fisher to round-robin through her characters' thoughts, which grow more complicated as each couple that arrived at the big house begins to fracture and fall for the spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends brought by someone else.

It is, all of it, a waiting game. A bottle episode of The Real World: Pre-War Switzerland, wine-soaked, sun-drunk, dealing with various forms of forbidden attraction. We know that Tim will lose his leg because the novel begins with a flashforward to his agony. And everything else is shadowed by that known catastrophe  by the understanding (by the readers, by the author) that no good times ever last, that frivolity is always the pre-game to tragedy.

But because this is M.F.K. Fisher (even young M.F.K. Fisher, still coming into her remarkable voice), the frivolity has its own value. It is beautiful. It is youth and second-youth, the joy of living in a time before sadness. It is the memory that we live on when memories of good times are all we have.

There is a point, about midway through the book, when a guest of Sara and Tim's walks the halls and feels as though everyone else there is ignoring him. Staring past him at some other thing. He asks, ""What was he, a ghost? That everyone looked through him today? Were all of them ghosts?""

And the answer, of course, is yes. Because eventually the easy days fade. Bad things happen. Ultimately, we are all just ghosts in the making.

But when no one is looking, he spends his time writing books about spaceships, aliens, giant robots and ray guns.

""Chug, chug, chug. Puff, puff, puff. Ding-dong, ding-dong.""

The beloved tale of the little blue engine  who helps bring a broken-down train of toys to the good little boys and girls on the other side of the mountain  has been chugging along for a very long time. But despite the locomotive's optimistic refrain  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can  the story has a somewhat checkered past: In its tracks, The Little Engine has left both a legal battle and a debate over whether the little blue engine is male or female.

The exact origins of the plucky, blue switch engine are a mystery. Variations on the tale have been around for more than 100 years.

""Interestingly, the oldest version of the story I could find was published in 1903 in Sweden,"" says Roy Plotnick, who spent 10 years investigating the little engine's back story as a hobby. (By day, Plotnick is a paleontologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago).

Another version he found appeared in a New York newspaper article in 1906 about a church in Brooklyn that had finally paid off its mortgage after 39 years. The article reported on the minister's sermon: ""They had a mortgage burning,"" says Plotnick, and the minister told a parable that is recognizable as a version of the story of the little engine:

He then went to another great engine and asked: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""It is a very heavy grade,"" it replied. The superintendent was much puzzled, but he turned to still another engine that was spick-and-span new, and he asked it: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""I think I can,"" responded the engine.

The most familiar version of the tale was inspired by a story called ""The Pony Engine"" and published in a children's magazine in 1916 by Massachusetts educator Mabel Bragg. She added new elements to the story including the broken-down train carrying cargo for kids like toys, peppermint drops, and  every child's favorite vegetable  spinach.

The first time The Little Engine That Could was published as a book was in 1930 with the credit ""as retold by Watty Piper,"" a pseudonym for Arnold Munk, who died in 1957. His daughter, Janet Fenton, was never too fond of the pen name.

""I think it's ridiculous, but he seemed to like it so that's what he used,"" says Fenton.

With all of the different versions of the engine story being told in one form or another, small wonder that Munk faced a legal battle. In the 1950s, a woman claimed that it was her cousin  Frances Ford  who wrote the story in 1910. The details of the case were sealed but Fenton says her father prevailed.

""I don't know if he sued somebody or somebody sued him, but he won,"" says Fenton.

Still, publishers of The Little Engine That Could did agree to let another company print an adaptation of Ford's story under the title The Pony Engine.

Now, to the next controversy: Children who read the story may not think much about whether the little blue engine is male or female. But adults do. If you remember the story, three trains  all male  refuse to help the broken-down engine over the mountain. They are too important, too busy, or too tired to pull an engine full of toys. (""I won't carry the likes of you!"" they said to the disappointed dolls and stuffed animals).

The little blue engine who (after significant cajoling) agrees to help is female  and also self-deprecating. ""They only use me for switching trains in the yard. I have never been on the other side of the mountain,"" she protests.

My colleague Beth Novey says that The Little Engine That Could was ""leaning in"" long before Sheryl Sandberg was. Francesco Sedita, president of the Penguin division that publishes The Little Engine That Could, likes the characterization.

She was ""literally the first to lean in! She really is the poster engine of the can-do attitude,"" says Sedita.

Now, over the years, some versions of the little blue engine have been male. And some folks have gotten pretty steamed over the issue. When the engine is a ""she,"" people have assumed the gender was changed to make the story politically correct. But in fact, she was a ""she"" as early as 1930.

Blogger Lara McKusky argues that the little blue engine is a do-it-all, Supermom martyr who is pressured into pulling more than she signed on for  while male trains had no problem setting boundaries and saying no.

Whatever your views on the little blue engine  male or female  the idea of a small train beating the odds through sheer will and determination is so old and so recognizable, it just had to be parodied. In 1976, Saturday Night Live did a bit about a little engine who has a heart attack and dies.

Italian author Umberto Eco died yesterday at the age of 84. We recall last year's conversation between the author and Scott Simon.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

The internationally renowned Italian author Umberto Eco has died at the age of 84. His final work ""Numero Zero"" was published last October. We'll visit now our last conversation with him. Scott Simon spoke with Mr. Eco last fall about ""Numero Zero.""

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SCOTT SIMON, BYLINE: It's about a Roma journalist named Colonna who's recruited to run a newspaper in the Italy of 1992, a newspaper called Domani, or Tomorrow, because the day it comes out will never be. The publisher intends only to use the paper as a vehicle to concoct nonsense, fuel fantasies and contrive conspiracy theories that could be used to blackmail people of Italy's inner sanctum of power - government, military, finance, the papacy. The book is ""Numero Zero,"" and Umberto Eco, one of the best-selling authors in the world, joins us from Milan. Thanks so much for being with us.

UMBERTO ECO: Thank you, yes.

SIMON: Colonna, your journalist, says I dreamed what all losers dream - about one day writing a book that would bring me fame and fortune.

Does being a loser make him vulnerable to saying yes to the schemes of the publisher??

ECO: All the characters of my novel are losers (laughter). Obviously, you must be a loser in order to work for a newspaper like that (laughter). I'm always fascinated by losers. Also, my ""Foucault's Pendulum"" - main characters were, in a way, losers.

SIMON: Yeah.

ECO: They are more interesting than the winners.

SIMON: And why's that?

ECO: They give a more to psychology. And then, in the world, there are more losers than winners, and so (laughter) my readers can identify themselves with the characters.

SIMON: At the heart of the story is a tipster, maybe pointedly named Braggadocio. And he's peddling a story - or maybe more a suspicion that - was Benito Mussolini really killed by Italian partisans then hung upside down along his mistress in the Piazzale Loreto?

ECO: OK, listen. Every fact in my novel is true except the story of Mussolini because Braggadocio is evidently a paranoid devotee of conspiracies. And so I have invented these conspiracies, seems to me pretty evident that Mussolini was shot. But all the other facts that look as incredible are true.

SIMON: Do you want people to read your novel and wonder if they can believe what they see, hear or read in the news?

ECO: Well, somebody has suggested to use my novel in the schools of journalism to teach what journalists shouldn't do. I hope that some reader will become more suspicious and attentive when reading a newspaper.

SIMON: I was struck toward the end of your story when a character says - I'll quote now - (reading) ""who was it said the truth shall set you free? You can't go around saying..."" - and then he provides a lot of nonsense in there - and then he says (reading) ""and people will say, 'oh, really?' It's interesting. And they'll turn around and get on with what they're doing.""

To what degree do you share the sentiments of that character, that we read about terrible things and then turn away?

ECO: Oh, yes. In a way, the final moral of my novel is that in 30 years, terrible things happen that - we read about them. But we have remained practically indifferent. And that was the real tragedy, not the fact that the boom blew up or a lot of people died, but that we have remained indifferent.

You know, there is a sickness in the media world. We read on Monday something, and on Tuesday we have already forgot what we have read. That is a real tragedy. News do not affect us in the way they should.

WERTHEIMER: Now we're not - that was Umberto Eco talking to Scott Simon. That was a revisit of the interview which was done in October.

npr,,Singing For Life In A Crypt In Harlem,[],"Opera singer Lawrence Brownlee is known for portraying kings and princes. But lately he's been thinking about real people: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, to name a few.

He's been thinking about the Black Lives Matter movement and an old spiritual called ""There's a Man Going 'Round Taking Names."" Decades ago, singers like Paul Robeson and Lead Belly recorded it. Brownlee, with jazz pianist Jason Moran, revives the old song to tell a new story for the 21st century.

""Jason and I chose this song because we felt it accurately captures a growing sentiment that's in society today,"" Brownlee says. ""So many senseless deaths of young African-American men.""

A crypt, they thought, would be an appropriate setting to perform their version of the song. So we took our cameras and microphones  and a lovely piano  deep into the active crypt below the historic Church of the Intercession in Harlem. The 1915 structure at 155th Street and Broadway is a New York City landmark and a dramatic setting for occasional concerts, including a December 2015 recital by Brownlee.

""I know that the ashes of the parishioners of this church are here in this crypt,"" Brownlee explains. ""You can feel the weight of death, you can feel the sting. It adequately captures the atmosphere, the somber mood that we are trying to capture with this song.""

In this arrangement, an already solemn song becomes even more dark and agitated.

""What [Jason] has done with the piano part has made it build, and you feel the unrest, the turmoil, the tension that is underneath,"" Brownlee says. ""This is something that is painful and difficult to deal with.""

Music director for Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers

Member of the Miles Davis Quintet in the mid-1960s

Co-founder of the band Weather Report

Bandleader and recording artist for more than 50 years

Winner of 10 Grammy Awards, including one for lifetime achievement

He's revered by many generations of jazz lovers, including the members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. They created new arrangements of tunes from throughout his career. Then they performed those arrangements with him in May.

""He didn't have any requests for changes of anything, amazingly, as I reflect upon it,"" says reedman Victor Goines. ""He was able to take what we had  even though he hasn't played some of those tunes in decades, I'm sure  and interpret them and make them as fresh as anything that is being written today.""

Shorter frequently revisits some of his earlier compositions. But his objective isn't retrospective, or to recreate his older style. He always makes it a point to try to make his music new again.

""It's almost like as an adult to go outside and play with some other adults like they used to do when they were kids,"" Shorter says.

The man who called himself ""Mr. Weird"" as a kid is a huge film buff and loves science fiction. He's also a practicing Nichiren Buddhist, and that pushes him forward too.

""Hon Nim Myo,"" Shorter says. ""It means from this moment, from this moment forward is the first day of my life. And don't, we don't lie and sit on accolades and rewards and awards and what-do-you-call-it, trophies, Grammys and this and that and bank accounts and fame and all that. That's the worst kind of fuel that you can rely on. The best kind of fuel that you can rely on is Hon Nim Myo. You start from now.""

In this episode of Jazz Night In America, we hear selections from the concerts he performed with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in New York. And we visit Shorter at his house in Southern California to find out more about his many sources of inspiration.

""I always tell the kids when they ask, 'What do you think about when you play?'"" Shorter says. ""I say, 'All right, let's try to play what you wish for.' Play what you wish for. Play what you wish for the world to be.""

i toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto

When it comes to enjoying the flavors in food, our tongues really aren't that useful. They can detect just a few basic tastes: sweet, salt, sour, bitter, umami, and maybe fat.

But real complexity comes from a food or drink's aroma, and the main way we sense all the compounds isn't from sniffing. Our bodies actually blast scents from the back of our mouths up into our nasal cavity where we can take in the difference between merlot and Chianti, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

Of course, you can smell foods by holding them up to your face and huffing. But that's not quite the same as taking in all the flavors of a food. ""When we have food or drink in our mouths, [the flavor] has to be going from the back of the mouth up and into the noise  going backwards,"" says Dr. Gordon Shepherd, a neuroscientist at Yale University.

To figure out how that works, Shepherd and a team of Yale engineers and neuroscientists built a model of the inside of a person's mouth, throat and nasal cavities. Then they used the model to analyze how air flows through it. They found that molecules from food we smell, or food volatiles, pile up at the back of our mouths and throats as we breathe.

When we're breathing in through the nose, as one might do while chewing, air whips down the nasal cavity and into the lungs, creating a kind of air curtain separating the throat and the mouth. ""That air curtain prevents all food volatiles from entering the lungs,"" says Rui Ni, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University and lead author on the study. When we exhale, air sweeps into the back of the mouth and throat where that heap of volatile compounds is and carries them up into the nose.

This all happens naturally, Ni says. ""But you can only do this effectively when you breathe smoothly,"" he says. If you're stuffing food with abandon down your throat or gasping for breath or heaving, you start to disrupt that normal pattern of airflow. Food volatiles won't store properly at the back of your mouth, and they could get sucked into your lungs and pass into the bloodstream.

The other problem, notes Laleh Golshahi, a mechanical engineer at Virginia Commonwealth University who was not involved with the study, is if you inhale too slowly while eating, that air curtain doesn't form effectively. Food volatiles don't get bounced out of the trachea and then could also be drawn into the lungs.

""[Breathing] not too fast and not too slow is the key,"" she tells The Salt in an email. ""Though the faster you exhale, you have a better chance to sweep food volatiles from the back of your throat toward the nasal cavity to smell.""

Ni agrees. And so the big takeaway from this study for us eaters is this: To get the best sensory experience from your food, eat slowly and breathe evenly as you do it.

The scientists behind the PNAS study only scanned the throat, nasal and oral cavities of one patient, Golshahi notes. So there could be variability among us that might make the situation different for each person. But best practices for anyone probably include relaxed eating and even breathing.

Savoring your food slowly seems to be the way to go for other reasons, too. One study found that when dieters ate slowly, it became easier to control their food intake. And kids who are forced to hurry down a meal in a few minutes ate less and threw out more food.","['lungs', 'mouths', 'food', 'youll', 'study', 'nasal', 'volatiles', 'air', 'mouth', 'throat', 'slowly', 'flavor', 'miss', 'scarf']"

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Lizzie Skurnick, cultural critic of Harper Lee's books, about what she will be most remembered for.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

The author Harper Lee died today in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. She was 89. In 1960, she wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" which became one of the best-loved novels of the last century. In the book, a young white girl in the Depression-era South tells the story of her father, a lawyer, as he defends a black man. Then, last year, Lees' novel ""Go Set A Watchman"" was published. It portrays that same lawyer that many saw as a hero as a bigot. To discuss Lee's legacy, we called the writer Lizzie Skurnick. She remembers reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" as a child. It wasn't the portrayal of racial justice that captivated her; it was the young narrator.

LIZZIE SKURNICK: I was really struck by Scout, the heroine, and how she was experiencing the South - kind of a tomboy in a town that was a lonely town and going through a lot of changes.

SHAPIRO: Was that because you saw yourself in Scout? You're not from the South. You do have one black parent, one white parent.

SKURNICK: No, I don't think so. I think it's because, to me, that has always been the most emotionally interesting part of the book. And when I was younger, I really was more focused on narratives about girls - you know, ""Little House On The Prairie,"" ""Island Of The Blue Dolphins.""

SHAPIRO: Do you think part of the reason ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" remains so beloved is because the problems that she was writing about 50 years ago have not gone away?

SKURNICK: No, I don't think it's exactly that because, you know, a novel like ""Native Son"" by Richard Wright, those are the same problems, too, but, you know, you don't see that book everywhere anymore. I think the reason it hasn't gone away is that Atticus, you know, as the brave lawyer defending the black community, that's how we'd like to see our country. But, you know, by the same token, we'd like it to happen because we have a white hero, you know, and not from a black hero. And I think it's such an interesting thing to look at how devoted people are to Atticus as the savior of racism in our country.

SHAPIRO: Are saying that, in a way, it's a slightly more palatable, less complicated, more mainstream way of taking on these possibly less palatable, more complicated problems?

SKURNICK: Oh, absolutely because - there was an article in The New York Times about how people who'd named their sons Atticus were now having to rethink the name. And as a black person...

SHAPIRO: Because in the later novel, Atticus was revealed to be racist.

SKURNICK: Right. And all I could think of was, you know, well, they could have named their son Crispus Attucks, or they could have named him Martin Luther King, or they could have named him any, you know, of the many, many black heroes in the country. But, you know, we want that hero to be Atticus. And I think that's also something we should start to think about and reckon with.

SHAPIRO: There's a satirical headline in The Onion that says, nation to honor Harper Lee by ensuring novel about horrors of racism always remains relevant.

SKURNICK: (Laughter) In a way, I think that's, you know, a good thing. I mean, as you said, I'm also Jewish and, you know, never forget is a big one in the Jewish world. And I do think Harper Lee, she depicted the, you know, polarization in a Southern town so well. And I do think that that's a portrait we should be reading for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: Lizzie Skurnick, thank you so much for talking with us.

SKURNICK: Thank you.

SHAPIRO: Lizzie Skurnick is publisher of the young adult classics, Lizzie Skurnick Books, remembering Harper Lee with us, who died at age 89.

npr,,Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces,[],"Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces

An editor once told me that if I asked 12 economists what was likely to happen I would get 13 opinions.

That line came to mind in recent days as I talked to people across NPR News about whether we do or do not allow music to be embedded in longer news stories. Im talking about incidental music that is there, at the very least, to improve the listening experience, but otherwise has no obvious connection to the story. Im also talking about longer pieces that are broadcast, not podcasts.

 No ... I was told. NPR has a rule: No music; no sound effects. We dont put anything in our broadcast pieces that isnt true to the stories.

 Sure ... I was assured. Weve been adding music for years when its felt that scoring would improve a piece.

 Well ... others said. Music can be used as a bookend or to create a bridge between sections of a long report. But it should never be layered beneath reporting.

 But ... began some. If its obvious to listeners that the music is being used in a feature in a humorous way or in a long news story to set off a particular section, its OK to run it beneath the script.

 Only ... said some. Music may be OK in features, but only rarely and with a less is more approach. That is, be sparing. Were making news stories, not movies.

There was agreement on one thing. Music cant be used in news stories to make editorial statements or to steer a listener toward judgments or conclusions. We dont do those things  just as we would not tell the audience how to feel about the news were reporting.

But, but, but ... what is an editorial statement and when is something manipulative? We cant agree. Theres a know it when we see it sense.

After all that, heres where are:

 There is no rule against putting music into broadcast pieces. Its been done and is being done every week in features or special projects. Listen to WESUNs For The Record series, a recent Hidden Brain piece that was recast for radio, Morning Editions report on How The Libyan Revolution Opened The Door To The Islamic State and the Changing Lives of Women essay from the gray-haired granny who has gone punk rock. Judge for yourself whether the music worked.

 Even those who advocate for the use of music say that because it sounds cool is not a reason to use it. Dont do this either: Add music in the hope it will make a bad story better. Theres a problem with the story. Fix it or kill it.

 Theres agreement that music must be treated like any other piece of our journalism. An informed, editorially based decision is crucial. Be prepared to answer this question: Whats that doing there?

 Were also in agreement that incidental music should not be layered beneath straight-forward, standard news stories.

 Less is more is a very important concept. Yes, theres a case to be made that we need to keep up with the times and that some popular podcasts (including NPRs) use music very effectively. But, we care deeply about principles such as honesty, transparency and fairness. Adding music can quickly raise questions in listeners minds about whether were staying true to our principles. A decade ago in Jonathan Kerns Sound Reporting, Jay Kernis said that music could be added to certain feature stories and mini-documentaries  on rare occasions. The occasions are probably less rare these days, but were still thinking that they should be carefully considered.

This isnt a thou must or must not note, as you can see. We have to take these thoughts and apply them as cases come up. That means talking to each other. Executive producers and desk heads need to be in on decisions about whether music should or shouldnt be used in broadcast pieces. They should bring in the DMEs (Chuck Holmes and Gerry Holmes) or standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott) if outside opinions are needed. In coming months, watch for training opportunities about the use of music.

i toggle caption Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images

At pretty much any Lady Gaga performance, you can count on spectacle: whirling lights, elaborate sets and many, many costume changes. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different  except that she was deploying her famous pipes in the service of another artist's music. As she pinballed through David Bowie's catalog in a career-spanning tribute to the late icon, it was a reminder that the 29-year-old Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her hero. After six Grammys of her own, a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel, duets with Tony Bennett, a Super Bowl national anthem and one very famous meat dress, there appears to be little that the woman born Stefani Germanotta cannot do.

And yet, she recently surprised herself. Alongside veteran hitmaker Diane Warren, Gaga co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the 2015 film The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses. The track is up for an Oscar, but the bigger breakthrough is a personal one. Like Warren, Gaga is a survivor of sexual assault, and says the decision to work on the song didn't come easily  but that once it was out there, stories from other survivors came flooding in, some prefaced with the admission that they'd never felt comfortable sharing their experiences until now.

Lady Gaga joined NPR's Michel Martin from New York to talk about songwriting that hits close to home, how artists and fans benefit from mutual support, and what David Bowie meant to her as a teenager gazing on the cover of Aladdin Sane for the first time. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below.

Michel Martin: I want to start off by talking about ""Til It Happens to You,"" which is nominated for an Oscar. I know it's not easy to talk about, but may I ask how you came to be involved in this project?

Lady Gaga: ""Til It Happens to You"" is something that has come out of a group of women coming together, who decided that they wanted to make a change. And that's me and Diane Warren and Bonnie [Greenberg], who was the music supervisor. When we first started talking, I was really not sure what to do. I have a very uncomfortable relationship with this topic because it's so personal to me, and I didn't know if I was ready to be a part of it. And as soon as I met Diane and she started to talk to me about what she wanted to do, I knew that I had to be brave, and I had to help tell this story to the world.

So, Diane and I met in New York City. She played me this song idea that she had started, and I immediately started crying. I was really unsure, even in that moment, if I was going to be able to do it. And she said, ""Well, I want you to make it your own. I want it to be something that you feel connected to."" And we started to change the song together  make it something that reflected both of our experiences with sexual assault. I guess it's a long story, but what I'm trying to say is that it's a quite complicated one. And it starts with me, when I was a young girl: I had this traumatic experience, and it's sort of coming full circle now, and really ending in a way for me, as I'm healing from it in writing this song with Diane.

Have other artists come to you since you recorded this song to talk about this issue? It just seems as though a number of people in your industry have had similar experiences and didn't talk about it for years, or ever.

Yeah, there are. I wouldn't reveal names of anyone that came to me personally to express that they had been through something similar. But there's a lot of people, men and women all over the world, who have experienced sexual assault not only on campuses and not only in the music industry, but within their own families and within their own relationships. It has been kind of overwhelming for both Diane and I, the amount of letters and people on the street that stop us to talk about this song and to tell us how much it means to them. I've had reporters tell me about their experiences with sexual assault in interviews, and they've told me, ""I've never ever told anyone that but you."" You know, that's a powerful thing to witness.

As an artist, and also through your foundation, you've worked on some really raw and emotionally complex issues. Given that you have a voice you can use to elevate a topic, how do you decide what you want to talk about?

Well, I always have been an activist for things that were just authentically a part of my life, that I felt connected to. In terms of my involvement in ""don't ask, don't tell"" and marriage equality and anti-bullying and social emotional learning in schools  these are all things that arise out of my relationship with the world and with my fans. I listen to them, I meet with them, they write me letters; I'm in tune with what people want to change in the world, and I want to be a part of moving that forward. I just genuinely feel that that's what you do when you're an artist: You stick up for the people around you.

I imagine that's draining, emotionally and physically. How do you manage that work and still do all the other things you do?

I guess I don't really think about it that way, you know? This thing that I do with caring about the message in my music, it's not separate from my work as a commercial artist; they're totally one and the same. I'm always going to be thinking about what my voice means. When I was 22, putting out my first couple records, I was a baby  and nobody really views you as any type of role model or anything. But as you get older, you realize that you have the attention of a lot of young people. And you think, ""OK, well, what should I say now? What can I say that will be impactful in a positive way?""

You know, just bringing it back to ""Til It Happens To You"": What happened to me happened 10 years ago. And then I became famous like overnight, it felt like, and I never really had time to deal with my issues. As soon as you start to make money selling your music, there's a lot of people around you that are very excited about what you have to offer financially to business, and they start to maybe forget that there's a person underneath all of that. [So] my team now, they spend every day making sure that I am healthy and happy and that I am able to focus on the things that I love.

We have to talk about David Bowie and your tribute to him at the Grammys this year. He's somebody you've been compared to in some ways: constantly reimagining yourself, testing the boundaries of presentation. Your performance actually used computer graphics to draw his famous lightning bolt on your face as you sang. How did you get to this point?

YouTube

Well, the moment that I saw the Aladdin Sane cover for the first time, I was 19 years old, and it just changed my perspective on everything, forever. It was an image that changed my life. I remember I took the vinyl record out of the casing and I put it on my vinyl player  which was on my stovetop in my kitchen, because I was living in this really tiny apartment and I had my turntable on my stove. ""Watch That Man"" came on and, I mean, that was just the beginning of my artistic birth. I started to dress more expressively. I started to go to the library and look through more art books. I took an art history class. I was playing with a band.

I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, my friends and I in New York, we've lived a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology since we were kids  and this is because of him. I just would never be here, or have the philosophy that I have, if I didn't have someone to look up to that you know blew my mind so intensely. You know the way that Nile Rodgers talks about Coltrane, and the way that Coltrane makes him think about jazz? That's how David Bowie is for me. You meet or see a musician that has something that is of another planet, of another time, and it changes you forever. I believe everyone has that, don't you? That one thing you saw as a kid that made you go, ""Oh, okay. Now I know who I am.""

How do you feel now that the tribute is over? I mean, it had to come together so quickly, and it was so complex and had so many layers to it.

How do I feel now that it's over? I mean, I feel like my whole career is a tribute to David Bowie.

So it's not! It's ongoing, right?

It's still going. I've been watching his videos all day long, and also listening to Blackstar, his last album, which is a truly incredible piece of music. It's one of the single greatest things an artist has ever done: making a masterpiece album that is their own eulogy. Can you imagine? To go into the studio every day and put your heart in that place, where you are saying goodbye to life? I mean, his art made him strong.","['brave', 'bowie', 'started', 'things', 'song', 'david', 'gaga', 'know', 'music', 'thats', 'lady', 'talk', 'really']"

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

""I am what I like to call 'new stroke',"" says Troy Hodge, a 43-year-old resident of Carroll County, Md. With a carefully trimmed beard and rectangular hipster glasses, Hodge looks spry. But two years ago, his brain stopped communicating for a time with the left half of his body.

He was at home getting ready for work as a food service director at a nearby nursing home. Hodge remembers entering the downstairs bathroom to take his blood pressure medications. He sat down on the bathroom floor and couldn't get up. He says he felt so hot, he actually splashed some toilet water on his face because he couldn't reach the sink.

When Hodge didn't show up for work, a colleague got worried and came over. She called 911 when she found him on the floor.

""I remember telling her not to let me die,"" says Hodge, ""and from then on I really don't remember that much."" He woke up a day or so later at a trauma center one state over, in Delaware.

""Troy experienced what we call an intracerebral hemorrhage, which basically just means bleeding within the substance of the brain,"" says Dr. Steven Kittner, a neurologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Hodge's high blood pressure probably damaged the tiny vessels in his brain, Kittner says.

Hodge is one of many Americans having strokes at a younger age. About 10 percent of all strokes occur in people between 18 and 50 years old, and the risk factors include some that Hodge had: high blood pressure, overweight, off-kilter cholesterol, smoking and diabetes.

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In particular, ischemic strokes  caused by a blockage in the blood vessel, rather than a bleed  are sharply increasing among people under age 50, statistics show.

This is not to say that stroke is becoming a disease of young people.

""The majority of strokes are still happening in older individuals, says Dr. Amytis Towfighi, a vascular neurologist with the University of Southern California. ""What's concerning is that the incidence and prevalence of stroke amongst younger individuals has increased, and it's increasing significantly.""

The most likely underlying reason, she says, is obesity; the constellation of health issues that come with it can wear down or block a person's blood vessels.

A national survey found that between 1995 and 2008, the increased number of young people (ages 15 to 44) who were hospitalized for stroke closely followed an increase in several chronic conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and lipid disorders.

""People who are obese are at greater risk for high blood pressure, and high blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke,"" says Dr. Mary George, senior medical officer with the CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention and an author on the national study. In 1995, about 3 percent of patients between 15 and 34 years old who had ischemic strokes were obese. By 2007, 9 percent were obese.

""One in three men in that age group had hypertension,"" says George. ""That's very high.""

Hodge is a big guy, and he says he'd had high blood pressure for a long time. Perhaps, on the day of his stroke, the extra pressure on his circulatory system just caught up with him. Like water in a bent hose, the volume of blood moving through his body overloaded a delicate passageway deep inside his brain, and the vessel burst.

It was key to his survival that Hodge's colleague found him quickly, so that he was able to get to surgeons who could drain some of the blood before the stroke caused irreversible damage. Still, in one day, Hodge became a patient at a facility just like the ones he used to work in.

""You know how they say, 'When you have a baby it changes your life?' Well, this changes your life,"" he says.

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

He couldn't walk or do anything that involved both hands. He started making lists, he says, because his short-term memory took a hit. And even in the bitter cold, he'll now head out the door with just a hoodie on.

""I'm not much of a coat wearer anymore because it's just too hard putting it on,"" Hodge explains.

With only half his body under control, he says, something as simple as getting dressed, cutting an onion or stepping off a curb suddenly became a huge task. Putting on socks, he says, is ""an ordeal. It's like an Oprah show.""

""You don't think of things that you do until you can't do them,"" he says. ""You basically have to start over again. I mean, you retrain your brain to use your limbs. You retrain your brain to remember. You retrain everything. It's pretty devastating.""

Hodge ended up living in a rehab facility for a year, relearning in his 40s how to do things that he'd done almost every day of his life.

Towfighi says a lot of her younger patients have similar experiences. She oversees neurological care for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, where the average age of stroke patients is 56. Even though young people tend to recover their abilities better, they can also have a tough time with recovery.

""It often affects the entire family when a young individual has a stroke,"" Towfighi says, because the family loses a breadwinner. ""I also do research on depression after stroke and found that a younger age is a risk factor for depression after stroke.""

Hodge didn't get depressed, but he did have to make some tough adjustments. He told his 18-year-old daughter he wouldn't be able to pay for her college or her car, and that she'd have to be on her own for a bit because he couldn't help out the way he used to.

""It was a long year, and there were times when I would just cry and not stop crying. But it passed,"" says Hodge.

Now, he has a one-story apartment and works part time at an exercise facility for the disabled. He's working on his blood pressure and trying to cut out cigarettes. Once a week, he goes to occupational therapy to work on everyday skills. To help get through it, he named his problem limbs. His left leg is Eddie. His left arm is Douglas. Hodge's cane is named Genevieve, after his mom.

""Eddie has done very well,"" Hodge says. ""I think he will continue to do well. Douglas? I talk to Douglas because I'm not so sure about him. He just kind of does his own thing.""

Giving one's troubled limbs a nickname or pep talk isn't unusual, says Lydia Bongiorni, an occupational therapist who worked with Hodge when he first entered rehab. ""I've had quite a few patients do that,"" she says. ""It shows a sense of humor. That's good.""

At an outpatient neurorehabilitation clinic at the University of Maryland, Bongiorni and Hodge spend a lot of time working with Douglas  Hodge's notoriously uncooperative left arm and hand. It's stuck in a stiff curl.

""Troy had a stroke a couple years ago, and people used to think you would never get movement back,"" says Bongiorni. But Hodge's muscles are fine, she explains  it's just the messaging system from his brain to his muscles that needs repair. ""I tell people that the brain wants to reconnect with that arm again, and we have to tap into different pathways of doing that.""

With a device the size of a sandwich, Bongiorni delivers a jolt of electricity through patches stuck on Hodge's arm. It takes a lot of tiny muscles working together to move a hand, and the electrical stimulation is thought to send signals that wake up the brain to the communication it needs to do with nerves and muscles.

Hodge's face strains as he grasps a deodorant stick and brings it haltingly up to his armpit. Bongiorni is trying to get him to use his left hand as a tool, rather than like a stump. They practice washing dishes, walking with a weight in that hand, and bringing a cup up to his mouth. Next on the list of Hodge's goals: taking out the trash.

""I'm not up to walking it to the dumpster just yet,"" he says. ""I'm going to get there. I'd say by the summertime I'll probably be taking it to the dumpster.""

Regaining his motion is not going to be easy. He's going to have to keep practicing these things every day on his own, like a musician mastering an instrument. But, he says, ""I'm only 43, so I have time to do that.""","['younger', 'adults', 'brain', 'strokes', 'rise', 'hodge', 'hodges', 'high', 'pressure', 'stroke', 'matailong', 'blood', 'shots']"

Average Mohamed YouTube

One Muslim man in Minnesota is on his own personal mission to undermine ISIS.

Mohamed Ahmed works as a gas station manager in Minneapolis. But he's dedicated much of his time to creating cartoons that explain Islam  and why ISIS is wrong.

He's the creator and voice of a cartoon character he calls Average Mohamed. For the past four years Ahmed has been producing these online cartoons to try to counter the ISIS message.

In Minnesota in particular, with its large Somali community, ISIS has had the most success in finding recruits. The state leads the country in the number of people seeking to join the terrorist group.

Ahmed, who came to the U.S. from Somalia 20 years ago, is betting that plain-speaking Average Mohamed can help stem the flow. He spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin about why he's so dedicated to this cause.

Average Mohamed YouTube

Interview Highlights

On how he came up with the character

Well it's simple, I'm an average guy with four children, a wife ... and a mortgage. And what is it that the average people know that basically can help in this process? Because it is average people recruiting each other and becoming extremists. So we felt like it's the same way we need an average guy espousing the values of majority Muslims. So Average Mohamed was a no-brainer because Mohamed is the most common name in the world.

On the message and people's response

Well it's a counter-ideology. The whole platform is a counter-ideology platform. And the message is about the values: three principles. One is peace, second one is democracy and the third one is anti-extremism. So it is a way to talk to the youth without veils. And we try to connect with them. [We're getting an] enormous amount of support across faiths, gender, race.

Average Mohamed YouTube

On reaching the right people with the anti-extremist message

Well I've actually accomplished that. Where a kid comes up to me and says  like for example the concept of suicide bombing. They said, ""Well suicide bombers go to heaven,"" I said, ""No, go back to your teachings.""

Who's got to be lying, is it the teachings of the prophet himself who's lying, or is it the teachings of Islamic State, al-Qaida and whoever these outfits are?

And it starts bothering them. These people are curious. Because I do outreach with the kids  I actually go to schools, mosques, madrasas. And the kids, they're looking at Syria. These are mostly Minnesota Sunni Muslims and they have a side they support. And they're wondering, how can we do something about that?

Well I tell them, ""You don't have to pack your bags and go join with ISIS. You can join the U.N. club, you can write to your senator, you can start a food drive."" We give them options. And we say, ""Look, this is within democracy. These are the powers and the choices you have."" And we drill down that message. We drill it down by speaking plainly.

What world do we want? I want a world without extremism. And I'm willing to work on it. I'm willing to talk about it, I'm willing to put my money on it.

So there's a clear and present choice between the voice of democracy and the voice of extremism. And democracy should stand up on its values and that's what I believe in.","['voice', 'isis', 'democracy', 'average', 'minnesota', 'willing', 'im', 'cartoons', 'values', 'message', 'appeal', 'taking', 'mohamed']"
npr,,"Analysts, Critics, Experts & Officials Agree: We Talk About Them An Awful Lot",[],"Analysts, Critics, Experts & Officials Agree: We Talk About Them An Awful Lot

On page 33 of Jonathan Kerns Sound Recording theres an entry titled: Avoid Meaningless Attributions.

Beware of the overused terms officials, analysts, critics and experts,  Jonathan writes. His message: Obviously, we should push to use actual names as often as possible. But when we cant do that, its often the case that other words can be found that are precise and offer relief from repetitive references to officials say this and experts say that.

The ubiquitous experts, for example, might be biologists, historians or numismatists, depending on their specialties. (Yes, Korva, we want you to use numismatists on the air some day.)

In some cases officials can just disappear from a line altogether. Jonathans example: Instead of writing Ford officials say theyre coming out with a new hybrid car, say Ford is coming out with a new hybrid car.

We bring this up because a look back over the past year indicates were not heeding his advice.

 Officials was heard 2,022 times.

 Critics was heard 1,055 times.

 Experts was heard 636 times.

 Analysts was heard 351 times.

Our guests were certainly responsible for many of the times those words were used. But NPR officials would have to concede that critics, experts and analysts are correct when they say that weve contributed more than our fair share. Robert Siegel can testify to that. He says in Sound Reporting that he has spent a lifetime trying to pull officials out of All Things Considered.

But, But, But ...

By now, every member of the Washington desk is poised to send an email that points out they often have to say administration officials or White House officials or Justice Department officials or some variation of those words that their sources insist on. We understand. All we ask is that alternatives be kept in the mix: Top advisers, close aides and others.

Emails are probably being drafted by the business desk (which has to deal with analysts), the science desk (experts) and others.

Dave Mattingly is surely wondering what hes supposed to do when he doesnt have time for even just a few more words.

Again, the guidance is to look for alternatives. After all, not only are the words overused, they can be problematic. Experts, for instance, is both vague and often too-readily bestowed. Critics can be a backdoor way of getting in the other side without identifying them.

Heres what everyone needs to know: When on assignment, do not turn to friends, family members, freelance producers or foreign fixers and ask them to take a picture to go with the digital version of your story.

This has been happening in recent months and as the Visuals team notes, its a problem. Among the issues:

 In most cases, the people being asked to take photographs are not trained journalists, so NPR may not be able to vouch for the journalistic integrity of their image-making.

 In some cases, the person whos been asked to take a photo is being employed by NPR to do a very specific job. Because the photo-making is not negotiated ahead of time, its asking someone to do more work than theyve signed on to do.

 Why not just pay them another $50? Well, the budget for photos is limited, so Visuals must carefully weigh whether to hire a photographer to cover any particular story. If the budget gets drained by ad hoc arrangements, we may not be able to hire professionals for other stories.

 Whats wrong with having your son or daughter come along to take photos? Asking minors to work for us raises child labor issues, liability issues and ethical issues.

We understand that it can be hard to collect tape and make images and do everything else that goes into being a multi-platform journalist. Heres what the Visuals team asks:

If reporters think they wont be able to handle gathering images in the field on their own, they and their editors should come to us and well figure out a solution. If a story warrants original imagery, that decision and hire should be made by a photo editor on the Visuals team.

Meanwhile, everyone should be on notice that photos taken by my friend Buzz or my nephew whos really good with a camera will be turned down for one or more of the reasons above.

Bottom line: Its important to remember that all assets for stories gathered in the field should be collected by NPR journalists, or NPR-commissioned journalists. The images that go with our reports are important. Think about it this way: Would you hand a microphone to that precocious niece of yours and have her do some interviews?

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

SAGAL: This week - we are sitting around at a beach ignoring our families so we can follow news on our phones. And while we're doing that, we thought we'd bring you some favorite bits from recent shows.

KURTIS: We at WAIT WAIT are always on top of the hottest trends, including dining. Here's a bluff the listener game from last June.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MELANIE FLINT: Hi Peter, this is Melanie calling from Houston, Texas.

SAGAL: Hey, how are things in Houston?

FLINT: Things are wet here.

SAGAL: Yeah, so I'm told. Big storm coming in. What do you do there in Houston?

FLINT: Well, I'm a mom of two beautiful boys and a third baby on the way in a few weeks.

SAGAL: Hey, congratulations. Oh, my gosh.

FLINT: Thank you. And I'm a psychotherapist in private practice.

SAGAL: That's great. So do you think - has your training in psychotherapy helped you as a mother?

FLINT: (Laughter). That's laughable.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, welcome to the show, Melanie. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Melanie's topic?

KURTIS: Everybody loves Ramen.

SAGAL: Ramen noodles are not just for college kids anymore. You can go to any city, you'll see the hip ramen places opening up. They're trendy. They're everywhere. It increases the volume of disgusting mouth noises wherever you go.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This week though, we read a story of someone taking their Ramen love to an extreme. Guess the true story, you'll win Carl Kasell's voice on your voicemail. Ready to play?

FLINT: I'm ready.

SAGAL: First, let's hear from Faith Salie.

FAITH SALIE: Do you love noodles? Do you love men? Then you'll love Ra-Men, an instant soup concoction that's all the rage in Iceland. Created by Gunnar Grimson, a Reykjavik-based entrepreneur, Ra-Men offers you a steaming bowl of Ramen noodles with a special flavor pouch. It's called the man packet...

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: ...And when ripped open and sprinkled on the hot, meaty broth, it makes your soup smell manly...

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: ...Meaning, like a man. Inhale the redolence of musk, pheromones and a tiny tinge of sweat that will make you hungry for a hot dish. That's the scent. When you eat it, it tastes like chicken.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Ra-Men, whose slogan is umami is your daddy...

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: ...Has become an instant hit with Icelandic women. But it's gay men from all over Europe who are flocking to you Ra-Men foam parties. Partygoers dust each other with man packets as they dance all night. As one enthusiastic reveler confesses, I try to stay away from carbs, but I can't resist Ra-Men.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Ra-Men, the instant noodle that smells the way a man should smell. Your next story of Ramen Emanuel comes from Charlie Pierce.

CHARLIE PIERCE: Some people speak in tongues. Some people speak in slurps. In keeping with the spirit of the famous Internet meme deity, the flying spaghetti monster, the campus ministry at Covenant College, a private Christian institution in South Dakota, has inaugurated a weekly communal meal and worship service on campus every Saturday night. The celebrants are required to bring only their faith and a box of noodles when they come to what is now known as the first church of Ramen, and the service is now playing to a packed house in the basement of the college's student center. Look at the way ""The Last Supper"" is described, said Wendy Walters, a Covenant senior who's a regular at the first church of Ramen. If Jesus and his apostles were alive today, they'd be eating Ramen like the rest of us and maybe Ramen would've been a sacrament for 2,000 years. The Reverend Fontz hopes to expand the first church of Ramen to other colleges and universities, be they specifically Christian institutions or not. We spread the gospel through Ramen as we spread the gospel of Ramen, he said. It's the medium through which we bring the message of salvation. Plus, it's good for you, too.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: A Ramen sacrament from Charlie Pierce. Your last story of noodles in the news comes from Luke Burbank.

LUKE BURBANK: Who doesn't love a piping hot bowl of delicious Ramen? No one, that's who.

(LAUGHTER)

BURBANK: But of course, there's the sodium and the calories you've got to watch out for. Thankfully though, a man named Ichiro Furuya has come up with an elegant solution, and that solution is submerging people in an even larger bowl of piping hot delicious Ramen. That's right. Patrons of Yunesson Spa House in Hakone, Japan, have taken to soaking in Ramen noodle baths, also known as the world's grossest Jacuzzis.

(LAUGHTER)

BURBANK: At a cost of 4,300 yen, or about $35 U.S., Furuya claims the high levels of collagen in the beef broth improve the skin while the warm temperatures speed up metabolism. While one American interviewed described the experience as, quote, ""slimy,"" photos from the spa house show smiling Japanese families packed into giant bowls of soup, complete with noodles, broth and a growing suspicion that those bubbles in your grandpa are not part of the culinary process.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right, Melanie, here are your choices - from Faith Salie, Ra-Men, the instant Ramen noodle flavor packet that tastes just like man, from Charlie Pierce, the first church of Ramen, where Ramen has become a religious sacrament and from Luke Burbank, Ramen noodle baths in Japan, where you can actually float in a bowl of Ramen for your health and wellness. Which of these is the real story of Ramen in the news?

FLINT: Gosh, as tempting as Luke's story is, I think I'm going to go with Charlie's story about the first church of Ramen.

SAGAL: The first church of Ramen in South Dakota.

FLINT: Yes.

SAGAL: All right. Well, we spoke to someone familiar with this real noodle story.

ERIN MOSBAUGH: The actual baths are shaped like Ramen bowls, and there are noodles hanging over your head while you bathe.

FLINT: Oh, no.

SAGAL: Oh, no. I agree with you. I agree with that response. That was Erin Mosbaugh. She is the editor at the food website firstwefeast.com, and she was talking about the horrifying yet apparently very lovely Ramen noodle baths at a spa in Japan.

FLINT: Wow.

SAGAL: If you've ever wanted to be a fishcake, just float in there. You can do that. So I'm sorry, you didn't win. You know, frankly, I wouldn't have picked that one because I wouldn't want it to be true.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Melanie, thank you so much for playing with us today. Bye-bye.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

Harper Lee's longtime friend Wayne Flynt will be delivering the eulogy at her funeral. He joins us on the line from Monroeville. Welcome, Mr. Flynt, and I'm so sorry for your and I guess all of our loss.

WAYNE FLYNT: Yeah, I think it's a sort of global loss, given the popularity of the novel across the world.

WERTHEIMER: Can you give us a sense about your friendship with Harper Lee? You have been in very close contact with her in the last years of her life.

FLYNT: That's correct. On average, once a month for the last 10 years since her stroke, we have sat and talked and told stories and exchanged insults...

(LAUGHTER)

FLYNT: ...Which she loves. I think one secret to our friendship was I did not treat her like a marble woman, and my wife - I joked with her, and I joked with her, and that was the sort of contours of our friendship.

WERTHEIMER: What's been on her mind, do you think, at - toward the end of her life? What was on her mind?

FLYNT: I would say what was always on her mind was the stories she had to tell, and the story was pretty obvious in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" maybe a bit - little bit less obvious and more obscure in ""Go Set A Watchman.""

WERTHEIMER: Which was a new - an unpublished book, which was just published recently.

FLYNT: Yes, that's right. It was actually her first book, but people can't get their heads around the fact that the central story she wanted to tell was the story of ""Go Set A Watchman."" And then when her editor and her agent tells America, who's not quite ready for that story, and I'm not sure America is ready for that story in 2016, as a matter of fact. She recast this story and the brilliant characterizations of the three children into a different book, and that became ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""

WERTHEIMER: There's been so much written about Harper Lee, and one of the things that you read over and over again is that she was famously reclusive. Is there something about her that we may not know and you think we ought to know?

FLYNT: Yes, she was legendarily private. I've never known such a private woman in my life. It's no surprise that she left Monroeville, a gossipy little southern town where everybody wants to know everybody's business, and went to the most anonymous city in America.

WERTHEIMER: New York City.

FLYNT: And she loved New York City. She gloried in being able to go to Broadway and people not recognize her, eating out and not having people come up to the table to remind her that their grandmother had been in school with her (laughter). She felt this world down here was a claustrophobic world.

WERTHEIMER: Do think that Ms. Lee took great satisfaction in knowing that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" really deeply affected many generations of Americans, it was read by millions of students?

FLYNT: Oh, yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I constantly tell audiences all over the world that the single greatest icon of American culture from the publication of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was that novel so that if we say, what conversation can we have that would lead us on a road of tolerance, and teachers have decided that if you're going to teach values in a school in America, the answer that American teachers at all kinds of schools have come up with, just let Harper Lee teach ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" And then all the teacher has to do is stand back and guide the discussion.

WERTHEIMER: Wayne Flynt will deliver the eulogy at Harper Lee's funeral. Mr. Flynt, thank you very much for speaking with us and again, so sorry that you've lost such a good friend.

FLYNT: Yes, and so is the world.

i toggle caption Facebook Facebook

In Pakistan, there aren't a whole lot of stand-up comics.

""When it comes to satire, I think as a culture, we kind of struggle with it,"" says Pakistani stand-up pioneer Saad Haroon.

His humor shines a light into some delicate areas.

""I wrote this song called 'Burqa Woman,' which is a parody of 'Pretty Woman,' "" Harron says.

He gives the audience a taste of his act:

Burqa woman, in your black sheet

Burqa woman, with your sexy feet

Burqa woman, my love for you, it grows

Every time I see your nose

Haroon's presenting a talk about comedy at the city of Karachi's literature festival along with Sanjay Rajoura, a writer and comedian from neighboring India. Hundreds of people are crammed into a hall to learn about something they rarely see.

""By definition, you know, comedy has to offend someone,"" Rajoura says.

India and Pakistan have a seven-decade history of animosity. It isn't long before a man in the audience starts heckling Rajoura over Kashmir, a core part of the dispute between the two nations.

Rajoura responds with a joke, then Haroon steps in.

""What is your problem, sir? He's a guest in our country! Let's show him a little welcome,"" Haroon says.

This audience, a mostly young crowd, responds with thunderous applause. They want to know how the comics prepare their acts and how far they can push their comedy.

""I want to ask you: Where do you draw a line between what is a joke and what isn't a joke  and if there is a line?"" says a young woman.

Some subjects do require careful handling, especially in a country like Pakistan where the military wields great power.

""I was just saying that whenever you start cracking jokes about the army, the plot thickens,"" says Haroon.

Haroon, who spends a lot of time in the U.S., is asked if it's different performing stand-up there.

He says he did a gig not long after the Paris terrorist attacks, and afterwards, a man came up to him.

""He's like: ""Saad. You're a Muslim and the terrorists are Muslims, do you condemn this attack? I said: ""Excuse Me! You're an ****** and the terrorists are ********. You are more closely linked to them than I will ever be! So you have to have your own narrative of what's going on.""

I ask Rajoura why he, an Indian, came to Pakistan.

To see friends, he says casually. He adds, ""I like to come to Pakistan and talk about peace and a lot of other stuff. Somehow or the other I am doing my bit. I dunno whether it is going to help or not.""

Working for peace through comedy's an ambitious undertaking in South Asia.

Extreme religious and social conservatism is widespread.

Risque or politically edgy humor can land you in trouble in India as well as Pakistan. Rajoura shrugs this off.

""If they want to shoot me, they shoot me. But I won't stop talking, because this is where the next nuclear war will happen. We have to fight it, and if we just sit in your living rooms saying  I don't want to say this  I'm gonna get shot. You'll die anywhere you know, so I am not scared.""

Saad Haroon doesn't seem at all scared either. He says there's no shortage of comedy material to work with in South Asia.

After all, Indians and Pakistanis often laugh at the same jokes.

""Like, I can't even start to get into it, the similarities. I mean, I think our people literally try to keep each other apart. We need boundaries, we need fences, we need visas, we need planes,"" Haroon says.

If the warm reception given here to these two comedians is anything to go by, maybe comedy might just bring down a few of those boundaries and fences.","['pakistan', 'woman', 'haroon', 'bridges', 'joke', 'rajoura', 'india', 'boundaries', 'standup', 'need', 'know', 'lot', 'crossing', 'line', 'comedy', 'npr']"
npr,,Dont Trust Your Mother Or The Internet,[],"Dont Trust Your Mother Or The Internet

The old newsroom adage if your mother says she loves you, check it out, applies to information on the Internet as well.

We all know this, but occasionally we get reminders of how important it is not to trust everything we see on the Web and to be sure to do our due diligence before passing along any information we get from there.

Case in point: On Wednesday, WAMUs Diane Rehm said to Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., senator, you have dual citizenship with Israel. Sanders quickly corrected her, but Diane went on to say that his name was on a list of lawmakers with such dual citizenship. Sanders told her that was some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet.

Diane later issued a statement saying she had gotten the incorrect information from a comment on Facebook.

Diane has apologized. She stated as fact something that wasnt.

We didnt learn something from this episode. This is a relearning.

We have an entry about this in the Ethics Handbook entitled Give preference to original sources. Heres what it says:

For years, NPR journalists have been cautioned by their editors that an all- too-common pitfall of fact checking is verifying facts through second sources, such as other news media outlets, that do not have direct knowledge about what they supposedly know. The problem has only gotten more serious as the Internet has made it ever easier to find what others have reported as fact. Thats why we value primary sources for our facts and we check them before broadcast or publication. And we value the work of the NPR reference librarians in helping our journalists get to those original sources (to email them, look for NPR Library in the NPR internal email address book). We value our own reporting and fact-gathering over that done by other news outlets. We strongly prefer to confirm and verify information ourselves before reporting. When reporting on events we did not witness personally, we seek multiple independent perspectives to get a sharper, more accurate understanding of what happened. And if we cant verify what others are reporting, but still believe the news is important and needs to be reported, we tell listeners and readers that NPR has not yet independently confirmed the news. Too often, incorrect information is passed down from one news story to another because of the failure of the first outlet to get it right. We strive to never pass on errors in this way.

In other words, check, double-check and triple-check those so-called facts you find on the Internet. Be very skeptical about the credibility of the sources. Get first-hand information. Go right to the original source.

Confirm with mom just how she feels.

npr,,Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions,[],"Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions

When there is news involving the university or institution that holds an NPR member stations license, conflicts of interest  perceived and actual  must be considered. So NPR editors ask questions:

 Is it a breaking news situation in which a station reporter could be our eyes on the ground and voice from the scene? Also is it a story that is about an event more than the institution? In recent years, this has happened most often when an institution is on lock-down because of a shooting or reports of a shooter. We would likely want to hear from a station reporter in our Newscasts and on our news magazines about what is happening.

 Is it a story that involves the institution but is not really about the institution? A recent example was the death of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith. We felt it would not be a problem for a station reporter to file an obit-type report for us. Yes, Smith was a towering figure at the university. But he was not controversial in the way that Joe Paterno, for example, became at Penn State. There wasnt anything about his time at UNC that we felt would give the appearance of a conflict if a station reporter was on our air. Bottom line: the news was about Smith, not the school.

 Is it a story about that institution? In such cases, we consider very carefully whether it would look like there was a conflict of interest if a station reporter files for us. We err on the side of caution. We know that listeners/readers may rightfully question whether a reporter who is paid by an institution should report about it. For example, if a schools football coach was under fire for putting a football player back on the field too soon after a concussion  leading to calls for the coachs firing and questions about the universitys response  that is a story we would not want to take from a station reporter at the school. The Penn State/Jerry Sandusky story was another that we felt should not be covered, on our airwaves, by a reporter from the schools station.

 Has the nature of a story shifted? Heres an example: While a station reporter is likely the logical person to use in the first hours after a campus shooting, that reporter and his/her station probably are not the right person or place to turn if questions start to come up about the universitys response to the incident.

We cant anticipate every possibility. The discussion above is designed to offer general guidelines and recent examples of how things have been handled. Situations will be considered case-by-case.

These things dont change from story to story: We value and need the solid reporting that member stations provide. We start with the assumption that we want to use their reports. Sometimes we may need to say no. But at all times we want to talk through the issues.

We have worked with some station-based news directors and PRNDI on the guidelines above; we welcome more feedback about our thinking and this guidance.

i Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis

As we launch into Thanksgiving week, consider this: Research shows that feeling grateful doesn't just make you feel good. It also helps  literally helps  the heart.

A positive mental attitude is good for your heart. It fends off depression, stress and anxiety, which can increase the risk of heart disease, says Paul Mills, a professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. Mills specializes in disease processes and has been researching behavior and heart health for decades. He wondered if the very specific feeling of gratitude made a difference, too.

So he did a study. He recruited 186 men and women, average age 66, who already had some damage to their heart, either through years of sustained high blood pressure or as a result of heart attack or even an infection of the heart itself. They each filled out a standard questionnaire to rate how grateful they felt for the people, places or things in their lives.

It turned out the more grateful people were, the healthier they were. ""They had less depressed mood, slept better and had more energy,"" says Mills.

And when Mills did blood tests to measure inflammation, the body's natural response to injury, or plaque buildup in the arteries, he found lower levels among those who were grateful  an indication of better heart health.

So Mills did a small follow-up study to look even more closely at gratitude. He tested 40 patients for heart disease and noted biological indications of heart disease such as inflammation and heart rhythm. Then he asked half of the patients to keep a journal most days of the week, and write about two or three things they were grateful for. People wrote about everything, from appreciating children to being grateful for spouses, friends, pets, travel, jobs and even good food.

After two months, Mills retested all 40 patients and found health benefits for the patients who wrote in their journals. Inflammation levels were reduced, and heart rhythm improved. And when he compared their heart disease risk before and after journal writing, there was a decrease in risk after two months of writing in their journals. Those results have been submitted to a journal, but aren't yet published.

Mills isn't sure exactly how gratitude helps the heart, but he thinks it's because it reduces stress, a huge factor in heart disease.

""Taking the time to focus on what you are thankful for,"" he says, ""letting that sense of gratitude wash over you  this helps us manage and cope.""

And helps keep our hearts healthy.","['gratitude', 'heart', 'good', 'risk', 'mills', 'journal', 'reduce', 'disease', 'patients', 'helps', 'shots', 'grateful']"

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.","['cannibalism', 'purchase', 'book', 'travel', 'zuckoff', 'survivors', 'bring', 'plane', 'worst', 'world', 'guy', 'disasters', 'best', 'extreme']"

npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"The Battle for Room 314, by Ed Boland",[],"Yet Another Teaching Memoir? A Teacher's Critique

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

Book publishers love stories about first-year teachers. The narrative arc is familiar: Exuberant idealism fades as the teacher battles entrenched bureaucracy, stale curriculum and disengaged colleagues or kids. The young educator then tries to overcome despair with creative grit and determination and struggles to make a difference.



The books often teeter between self-promotion and slams against the public education system. Some, however, actually shed light on the yawning gap between reformist rhetoric and classroom reality.

This month there's a new one out: The Battle for Room 314: My Year of Hope and Despair in a New York City High School by Ed Boland, from Grand Central Publishing.

To get a take on how it lands in this genre, I asked a veteran New York City teacher to read it and write up her thoughts. Nicole Dixon teaches at East Side Community High School, which serves grades 6-12 in Manhattan's East Village. Here's her review:

When I first became an English teacher in New York City, I would often find my conversations about my job traveling an increasingly well-worn path: ""You teach at an ... inner city public school? Those kids must be tough!"" Whether these comments were made with an air of, ""Good for you!"" or ""You must be crazy!"" they felt somehow cut from the same voyeuristic cloth, especially when followed up by, ""You must really have some stories!""

I did, in fact, have many stories, but the one I found myself telling most often was a humorous one centered around my inadvertently stealing a student's backpack. I knew, of course, as I told it, that this was not the kind of story anyone had in mind. I knew from the way their voices dropped at ""inner-city"" (read: Black, Latino, poor) that what they wanted was a tale replete with fistfights and broken homes and gang signs and teen moms. A heartwarming teacher-as-savior ending was preferred, but optional.

I could never fully articulate why I didn't feel comfortable telling those stories until years later, watching a TED talk given by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. In it, Adichie speaks about her own experiences growing up as a child of middle-class academics in Nigeria, and then arriving in the U.S. for college, only to discover that her roommate expected her to be impoverished, unable to speak English, and listen to tribal music. She says, ""My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.""

I found myself thinking of Adichie's talk while reading Ed Boland's The Battle for Room 314. Boland, who left a position as development director for an educational nonprofit to try his hand at teaching, finds find himself deeply disillusioned by his experience.

Boland's memoir of his first and only year in a New York City public high school classroom certainly does not shy away from telling the kind of story about inner city teens that dominates the media and our cultural imagination. He opens the book with three epigraphs  a lofty one about the meaning of education from Horace Mann and one about the value of struggle from Alfred the Great.

And one from a student's ""Getting to Know You"" questionnaire: ""I like to fight, I like to f***, and I like pie.""

From that moment on, Boland's year is all downhill. Students throw spitballs, homophobic slurs, curses and calculators. He is disrespected and ignored, gets injured splitting up fistfights, becomes an inadvertent pawn in a student's drug ring and the target of another's accusations of sexual harassment.

Boland is the first to admit that his failings as a teacher were perhaps even greater than those of his students, unflinchingly detailing every disastrous moment. Including: a formal classroom observation that his assistant principal declares ""the worst one I have ever conducted,"" and confessing that he responded to one student's ""F*** YOU!"" with a ""No, Solomon, F*** YOU!""

Boland is candid about his own shortcomings, and gestures at the larger systemic and societal issues behind the problems in his school.

But he lingers longest on the outrageous behavior of his students: Chantay climbs on desks and hollers for Boland to perform an obscene act, and Kameron flashes his ""dark shark eyes"" as he threatens violence against students and teachers alike.

But underneath the grand displays of insubordination, the innocuous race and class-marked details of his students' lives seem to wear on Boland almost as heavily. ""I began to loathe my students,"" he writes, ""resenting everything about them that was their lot  their poverty, their ignorance, their arrogance,"" as if it is all behind him.

But his anger and disdain still pulse insistently through his writing.

It's not that I don't sympathize with him. Being a teacher is one of the hardest jobs imaginable. I remember during my first year the unique mixture of exhaustion and gratitude at the end of every day that I did not cry in front of my students. I remember repeating my mantra of ""just do less harm than good today"" over and over on the long walk to work from the subway. It's not that I don't recognize in his students some of my own.

Certainly many of my former students would probably meet Boland's definition of ""thuggy,"" a word he uses often. I taught, for example, a charismatic, budding Bloods leader who replaced all of his ""c""s with ""b""s so as not to accidentally compliment Crips, and a girl recently released from juvie for selling the crack on which her own mother fatally overdosed.

I know there were even moments at which I thought of them as ""monsters""  a word Boland uses so many times I stopped counting.

Teaching is a battle, and the enemies are everywhere: Poverty, racism, ignorance, rotten cops, wrong-minded government officials, greedy educational corporations, incompetent administrators, the occasional parent. I've wanted to annihilate each and every one of them at one point in my teaching career.

But the battle is never, as Boland implies and as many first-year teachers imagine, a battle against students for power in the classroom. Every time he suggests that, he makes the real battles more invisible, and harder to fight.

Boland's focus on his personal struggle to maintain order takes readers away from the more important national conversation about the societal inequities that are reflected in all of our classrooms.

And as a teacher, valuing compliance over the messy process of actual learning is a rookie mistake. Boland's older sister, Nora, also a teacher, tells him that his students ""are people with free will...[t]hey have very little power in their lives, so they will use it where they can.""

The longer I teach, the more I see how little power most students feel they have both in and out of the classroom. My most important job is to give them as much power as I can.

Had Boland stuck around another year or two (he left after one year and returned to his career as an administrator at an educational access program) he might have written his story quite differently.

What he might have learned as a second-, third-, or fourth-year teacher would be enough to fill a much more interesting book. I returned to school after that first year to find that something inside me had loosened, and that enemies I hadn't realized I had  my own fear and a tendency to take things personally  had fallen away.

Like Boland, who raged at union rules which prevented him and his colleagues from giving up their one prep period to teach an extra class that would make their other classes smaller, I hatched a similar plan at my charter school. In time, I realized the importance of time without students, and how many young teachers work such insane hours that they burn out and leave teaching.

I cringed at Boland's descriptions of how he planned his lessons  a seeming daily quest to find a different interesting activity to hook students and make them feel successful. But the truth is that my own first-year lessons often felt just as purposeless and desperate.

Years later, I've learned that the lessons that grab kids are the ones that ask students to do hard work that feels important and authentic.

In the end, I came away respecting Boland's honesty, admiring his writing, and vehemently agreeing with his pleas to integrate America's public schools.

It is a book that many readers may enjoy because it is a book that they expect, one of the two narratives (this time, chaos without the inspirational ending) about inner city schools that seem acceptable today.

But his book ultimately fails to follow Adichie's exhortation to ""engage with all of the stories"" of his students and their community.

The official statistics for shootings by police in America are bad to non-existent. The totals are under-reported, and the Justice Department admits it doesn't have crucial details such as the race of people shot, and whether they were armed.

Since the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown, this lack has become an embarrassment. But that's slowly beginning to change.

KPCC Analysis Of Police Shooting Data i toggle caption KPCC KPCC

Take, for instance, the nation's second-largest metro area, where NPR member station KPCC in Pasadena, Calif., has created a database of shootings by law enforcement officers in Los Angeles County from 2010 to 2014.

KPCC analyzed paperwork from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, which reviews police shootings; the L.A. County medical examiner provided the ethnicity of fatal shooting victims.

During those five years, KPCC found, police shot 375 people; no officers were prosecuted. Of the people shot, about one in four was unarmed. And 24 percent of those shot and killed were black, while African-Americans make up 8 percent of the L.A. County population.

The dataset also includes a breakdown of factors such as the justifications given by police who shoot suspects.

For instance, 148 people were shot for moving their hands out of sight or reaching for their waistbands; of those, 47 turned out to be unarmed.

When Is Use Of Force Justified?

Whether that proportion seems high is up for debate. As KPCC's reporting about those shootings puts it:

""[Michigan State University criminologist William Terrill] said he doesn't think missing hands alone are enough to justify self-defense. 'If they were shooting all the suspects that reach or don't show their hands when the officer wants them to,' he said, 'I can't imagine the number of police shootings  if the public thinks there's a high number now  I can't imagine what there would be.' Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Commander Rod Kusch, whose homicide bureau investigates all deputy shootings, disagrees. 'There is nothing that requires us to actually wait and see the gun or wait to see the knife,' he said. Deputies' 'background, training and experience' with armed suspects triggers a self-protection response when a suspect's hands disappear, he said.""

American police have considerable leeway in these situations because of two Supreme Court rulings in the late 1980s. In essence, the court held that officers may use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses imminent danger of bodily harm to them or someone else. In addition, officers may not be judged based on information they didn't have at the moment they employed deadly force.

In fact, on Monday, the Supreme Court bolstered the protections for officers, when it ruled that an officer in Texas could not be sued for shooting into a fleeing car from a highway overpass.

Police say these standards are only fair, and without them they would live in constant fear of being second-guessed after the fact. They say if they had to worry about being prosecuted for honest mistakes or for misreading a threat, they wouldn't be able to do their job.

On the other side, groups such as Black Lives Matter say this benefit of the doubt has gone too far. They say prosecutors are too deferential to police, and overly aggressive use of force routinely gets a pass.

Growing Efforts To Collect Statistics

Missing from this debate are good numbers. The federal government has tried  and failed  to get police agencies to report details about the use of deadly force. FBI Director James Comey often complains about how little data Americans have to work with, when debating policing and race.

Even some police organizations say it's a problem; they say the current national discussion relies too much on anecdotes and high-profile incidents caught on video, and they say better statistics would create a more sympathetic view of how police use force.

The federal government isn't about to require police agencies to start reporting these numbers, but it is experimenting with the next best thing. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has a pilot program to gather detailed information about ""arrest-related deaths"" in America  and they're going to use ""open-source data"" as a basis for their statistics.

In other words, they'll draw on information that media organizations such as KPCC are collecting on police shootings. Equipped with these numbers, the BJS will then ask police agencies directly for more information on the cases that have been identified.","['information', 'shootings', 'shot', 'piecing', 'hands', 'officers', 'angeles', 'los', 'say', 'numbers', 'kpcc', 'shooting']"

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

""I am what I like to call 'new stroke',"" says Troy Hodge, a 43-year-old resident of Carroll County, Md. With a carefully trimmed beard and rectangular hipster glasses, Hodge looks spry. But two years ago, his brain stopped communicating for a time with the left half of his body.

He was at home getting ready for work as a food service director at a nearby nursing home. Hodge remembers entering the downstairs bathroom to take his blood pressure medications. He sat down on the bathroom floor and couldn't get up. He says he felt so hot, he actually splashed some toilet water on his face because he couldn't reach the sink.

When Hodge didn't show up for work, a colleague got worried and came over. She called 911 when she found him on the floor.

""I remember telling her not to let me die,"" says Hodge, ""and from then on I really don't remember that much."" He woke up a day or so later at a trauma center one state over, in Delaware.

""Troy experienced what we call an intracerebral hemorrhage, which basically just means bleeding within the substance of the brain,"" says Dr. Steven Kittner, a neurologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Hodge's high blood pressure probably damaged the tiny vessels in his brain, Kittner says.

Hodge is one of many Americans having strokes at a younger age. About 10 percent of all strokes occur in people between 18 and 50 years old, and the risk factors include some that Hodge had: high blood pressure, overweight, off-kilter cholesterol, smoking and diabetes.

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In particular, ischemic strokes  caused by a blockage in the blood vessel, rather than a bleed  are sharply increasing among people under age 50, statistics show.

This is not to say that stroke is becoming a disease of young people.

""The majority of strokes are still happening in older individuals, says Dr. Amytis Towfighi, a vascular neurologist with the University of Southern California. ""What's concerning is that the incidence and prevalence of stroke amongst younger individuals has increased, and it's increasing significantly.""

The most likely underlying reason, she says, is obesity; the constellation of health issues that come with it can wear down or block a person's blood vessels.

A national survey found that between 1995 and 2008, the increased number of young people (ages 15 to 44) who were hospitalized for stroke closely followed an increase in several chronic conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and lipid disorders.

""People who are obese are at greater risk for high blood pressure, and high blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke,"" says Dr. Mary George, senior medical officer with the CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention and an author on the national study. In 1995, about 3 percent of patients between 15 and 34 years old who had ischemic strokes were obese. By 2007, 9 percent were obese.

""One in three men in that age group had hypertension,"" says George. ""That's very high.""

Hodge is a big guy, and he says he'd had high blood pressure for a long time. Perhaps, on the day of his stroke, the extra pressure on his circulatory system just caught up with him. Like water in a bent hose, the volume of blood moving through his body overloaded a delicate passageway deep inside his brain, and the vessel burst.

It was key to his survival that Hodge's colleague found him quickly, so that he was able to get to surgeons who could drain some of the blood before the stroke caused irreversible damage. Still, in one day, Hodge became a patient at a facility just like the ones he used to work in.

""You know how they say, 'When you have a baby it changes your life?' Well, this changes your life,"" he says.

i toggle caption Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

He couldn't walk or do anything that involved both hands. He started making lists, he says, because his short-term memory took a hit. And even in the bitter cold, he'll now head out the door with just a hoodie on.

""I'm not much of a coat wearer anymore because it's just too hard putting it on,"" Hodge explains.

With only half his body under control, he says, something as simple as getting dressed, cutting an onion or stepping off a curb suddenly became a huge task. Putting on socks, he says, is ""an ordeal. It's like an Oprah show.""

""You don't think of things that you do until you can't do them,"" he says. ""You basically have to start over again. I mean, you retrain your brain to use your limbs. You retrain your brain to remember. You retrain everything. It's pretty devastating.""

Hodge ended up living in a rehab facility for a year, relearning in his 40s how to do things that he'd done almost every day of his life.

Towfighi says a lot of her younger patients have similar experiences. She oversees neurological care for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, where the average age of stroke patients is 56. Even though young people tend to recover their abilities better, they can also have a tough time with recovery.

""It often affects the entire family when a young individual has a stroke,"" Towfighi says, because the family loses a breadwinner. ""I also do research on depression after stroke and found that a younger age is a risk factor for depression after stroke.""

Hodge didn't get depressed, but he did have to make some tough adjustments. He told his 18-year-old daughter he wouldn't be able to pay for her college or her car, and that she'd have to be on her own for a bit because he couldn't help out the way he used to.

""It was a long year, and there were times when I would just cry and not stop crying. But it passed,"" says Hodge.

Now, he has a one-story apartment and works part time at an exercise facility for the disabled. He's working on his blood pressure and trying to cut out cigarettes. Once a week, he goes to occupational therapy to work on everyday skills. To help get through it, he named his problem limbs. His left leg is Eddie. His left arm is Douglas. Hodge's cane is named Genevieve, after his mom.

""Eddie has done very well,"" Hodge says. ""I think he will continue to do well. Douglas? I talk to Douglas because I'm not so sure about him. He just kind of does his own thing.""

Giving one's troubled limbs a nickname or pep talk isn't unusual, says Lydia Bongiorni, an occupational therapist who worked with Hodge when he first entered rehab. ""I've had quite a few patients do that,"" she says. ""It shows a sense of humor. That's good.""

At an outpatient neurorehabilitation clinic at the University of Maryland, Bongiorni and Hodge spend a lot of time working with Douglas  Hodge's notoriously uncooperative left arm and hand. It's stuck in a stiff curl.

""Troy had a stroke a couple years ago, and people used to think you would never get movement back,"" says Bongiorni. But Hodge's muscles are fine, she explains  it's just the messaging system from his brain to his muscles that needs repair. ""I tell people that the brain wants to reconnect with that arm again, and we have to tap into different pathways of doing that.""

With a device the size of a sandwich, Bongiorni delivers a jolt of electricity through patches stuck on Hodge's arm. It takes a lot of tiny muscles working together to move a hand, and the electrical stimulation is thought to send signals that wake up the brain to the communication it needs to do with nerves and muscles.

Hodge's face strains as he grasps a deodorant stick and brings it haltingly up to his armpit. Bongiorni is trying to get him to use his left hand as a tool, rather than like a stump. They practice washing dishes, walking with a weight in that hand, and bringing a cup up to his mouth. Next on the list of Hodge's goals: taking out the trash.

""I'm not up to walking it to the dumpster just yet,"" he says. ""I'm going to get there. I'd say by the summertime I'll probably be taking it to the dumpster.""

Regaining his motion is not going to be easy. He's going to have to keep practicing these things every day on his own, like a musician mastering an instrument. But, he says, ""I'm only 43, so I have time to do that.""","['younger', 'adults', 'brain', 'strokes', 'rise', 'hodge', 'hodges', 'high', 'pressure', 'stroke', 'matailong', 'blood', 'shots']"

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.","['migration', 'life', 'code', 'ghosh', 'explore', 'modernday', 'car', 'tales', 'hyphenated', 'switch', 'writers', 'odysseys', 'sea', 'train', 'world', 'ship', 'identities', 'journey', 'npr']"

North Korea is considered the most reclusive country in the world. Outsiders know very little about what happens inside the Hermit Kingdom.

North Koreans, in turn, know very little about the outside world. The regime of dictator Kim Jong Un bans nearly all forms of outside media. North Koreans are only exposed to what their government tells them, giving a them skewed view of their own country.

A group of nonprofits in the U.S. is trying to change that with USB drives. They are asking Americans to donate thumb drives, which are then loaded with Western TV and movies and smuggled into North Korea.

The idea for Flash Drives for Freedom was started by the Human Rights Foundation. Sharon Stratton is the U.S. program officer with the North Korean Strategy Center, one of the groups involved. She spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin about what goes on the flash drives and what the risks are for the people involved.

Interview Highlights

On what information goes on the flash drives

Essentially what we do is we load up these memory storage devices with very different kinds of content. So, not only South Korean or Western films, shows. We put on documentaries, radio recordings, PDFs with South Korean newspapers as well as an offline version of Wikipedia. So we load these memory storage devices, including USBs, with this content. And we work with a network of trusted partners who work on the North Korea-China border. And they distribute these into North Korea.

On what they want the information to show

Through focus groups in South Korea, we're able to sit down and have more in-depth conversations with recent defectors about what kind of media North Koreans are seeking, what they're amenable to, and what they want to see more of.

We don't put in any content that's inflammatory or critical or antagonistic towards the North Korean government. Not only would that compromise potentially the safety of North Korean users who are accessing this foreign media, but it's also just not going to be very effective and North Koreans aren't really interested in that kind of content.

Other kinds of content that we put on USBs are documentaries that are made by North Korean defectors who are adjusting to their new lives in South Korea. So they're able to show them through the eyes of a North Korean: What it's like living in South Korea  the challenges that come along with that, but also the opportunities.

On the risk involved in watching

It is technically illegal in North Korea to access and to distribute foreign media. Security of these individuals in North Korea is our primary concern. It's important to remember that access to information in North Korea has been increasing. It's not just ordinary North Koreans who are accessing foreign media, it's actually also elites  people who are in government positions, people of rank and privilege. So it's becoming more common. Simply possessing a USB itself is not going to see someone get thrown immediately into jail.

On the types of punishment for being caught watching

It's difficult to confirm what these punishments are but defector accounts that we get range from ... open trials, or maybe you that have to pay off an official to avoid any kind of punishment. It is difficult to get information exactly on what kinds of punishments are being meted out.

On the smugglers who take the flash drives into the country

The North Korea-China border is much more porous than maybe many people would expect. There's somewhere in the tens of thousands of Chinese and North Koreans who are moving across that border. They're moving information, they're moving goods. And it's risky work for them and there is a cost involved, so we do pay them.

On the goals of the campaign

The end goal of our information dissemination efforts is not to get people to defect. It's more about North Koreans who are in North Korea being able to have a changed worldview. Change their perspectives and then lead and sort of speak to any changes they want to see in their country themselves. The end goal is not to say, ""We want you to leave North Korea."" We want North Koreans to be able to say, ""Well this is what I want for North Korea.""","['koreans', 'information', 'korea', 'north', 'media', 'flash', 'breaking', 'drives', 'theyre', 'blockade', 'korean', 'south']"

Ferrante Fever goes something like this: You pick up one of Elena Ferrante's books because a friend told you that you had to read it. You read a few pages, and then before you know it, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning, you've finished the book, and you're on the hunt for the other three titles in the Neapolitan series.

This cultural phenomenon comes our way via translation  the novels were translated from the Italian by New Yorker editor Ann Goldstein. Ferrante is famously private  she gives no interviews, no one knows who she is  so Goldstein has become an unintentional face of the series.

But just in case anyone was wondering if Goldstein is Ferrante, she'd like to clear that up right away: ""No, I am not. I can say that without equivocation,"" she tells NPR's Linda Wertheimer. ""And I can also say I don't know who she is.""

Goldstein learned Italian late in life. ""I had this sense that I wanted to read Dante in Italian,"" she says. So she signed up for an Italian class at The New Yorker.

Goldstein talks with Wertheimer about her recent projects; in addition to translating Ferrante's latest, The Story of the Lost Child, she's also translated Jhumpa Lahiri's In Other Words, and edited Primo Levi's complete works.

Interview Highlights

On trying to take a feeling from one language, and express it in another

Well naturally that's my goal. You can't possibly achieve that in a perfect way because there's so many things you have to take into consideration. You know, think about every word, every sentence, every paragraph, and do what you can.

On whether she liked the Neapolitan novels

I loved these books. ... It's really the story of a young woman, or two women, growing up in Naples in a poor neighborhood. The way that they get out of it  or don't get out of it  that's part of it. But it's also the story of the mid-20th century in Italy so it's really like a social, historical and personal novel. I think that even though I didn't live in Italy in those years, it did cover that same type of generational upbringing that someone like me might've had in America.

On her philosophy  or lack thereof  for approaching different writers

I don't have a philosophy. If I had a philosophy, it's that I'm kind of literal minded. For example, I would never translate poetry  it's too hard, there are too many levels. Not that prose doesn't have many levels, but it's more grounded. I like to think of the individual words, then you put the word in the sentence, then you have to think about what that word means in the sentence, then you have to read the sentence in the paragraph  you're sort of building up like that; that's my philosophy.

On how she thinks of her job  writer, collaborator, facilitator?

Enabler. My day job, I'm essentially a copy editor and I think there are certain similarities because you're dealing with words; you're trying to enable someone to express him or herself as much as he or she possibly can, and I think in a sense that's what translation is. You're expressing something that's originally in one language in another language.","['youre', 'word', 'way', 'novels', 'read', 'sentence', 'thats', 'think', 'translator', 'goldstein', 'job', 'words', 'enabler', 'ferrante', 'elena', 'italian']"

When Jeb Bush suspended his bid for the GOP nomination, it brought to a close a chapter in American politics that has lasted nearly four decades. A period when the Bush family played a major role influencing the course of the country.

The combined Bush family political stats just going back to 1980 are beyond impressive.

Two presidents.

One vice president.

Two governors.

Seven national campaigns.

And there were lots of victories, but unfortunately for Jeb Bush, the most recent one won't be going in the win column. It wrapped up among loyal, but sad supporters in a hotel ballroom in Columbia, S.C.

As Jeb Bush began his primary night remarks on Saturday, it soon became clear he was bearing bad news. He would finish fourth place at best-in-the-state GOP contest. Not good enough to justify continuing.

""The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken,"" he said. Then, occasionally choking back tears, he added, ""So tonight I am suspending my campaign.""

But let's start this journey almost exactly 36 years earlier. It was January of 1980, and the Iowa caucuses were fast approaching.

Among the six candidates on stage were Sens. Howard Baker and Robert Dole, and former ambassador to China and the United Nations, former CIA chief, former congressman and former Republican Party Chairman George H.W. Bush. Skipping the debate was Ronald Reagan.

It was Bush's first presidential run and he declared, ""I want to be a part of the answer, not a part of the problem and that's why I need your help as we go into these Iowa caucuses on January 21st.""

He was well received in the auditorium that night, and on caucus day. George Bush would score a surprise victory, narrowly beating out Reagan. That strong showing was a big reason he became Reagan's running mate.

Eight years later, it was Bush's turn. He won the nomination and beat Democrat Michael Dukakis to win the White House.

During the 1988 Republican Convention, Bush spoke modestly of his military service as a Navy pilot in World War II.

""I say it without boast or bravado. I fought for my country. I've served.""

But his most famous line of that speech was this pledge, ""Read my lips. No new taxes.""

The applause was deafening, but it was a promise Bush would break as president.

The reversal played a role in his defeat in his bid for re-election four years later.

One of the triumphs of his presidency was his response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990.

President Bush pulled together a coalition of nations to respond.

He delivered a nationally-televised address, announcing, ""Air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq. We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities.""

Opeation Desert Storm was a success. Saddam Hussein was defeated. But he remained in power, setting the stage for another war in Iraq a decade later.

In 1997, at the dedication of his presidential library at Texas A&M University, the ceremony was opened by the state's governor, George W. Bush.

He praised his father: ""President Bush was a man who entered the political arena and left with his integrity intact.""

When George W. Bush ran for president himself, some saw it as a way to avenge his father's defeat.

The 2000 election ended in chaos. Lawyers battled over the recount in Florida, where Jeb Bush was governor. It took five weeks and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to declare a winner  George W. Bush was president-elect. Al Gore conceded defeat.

Bush spoke from the Texas state Capitol, saying, ""Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements.""

But it was a nation bitterly divided into red and blue camps. Eventually Americans did rally behind the president, when terrorists struck on Sept. 11.

President Bush addressed the nation: ""These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our country is strong.""

War in Afghanistan followed. But President Bush then went too far for many Americans when he invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

The president delivered a speech in Cincinnati, warning, ""We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.""

The stated goal was to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but none was ever found.

As the war dragged on, public support plummeted. It also sent Bush's approval rating downward, as did the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At one point his approval rating fell to 25 percent, according to Gallup, and voters drove Republicans from control in Washington.

In an interview with Morning Edition in November 2014, the former president discussed the prospect of a third Bush presidency, as his brother Jeb mulled a run. He was asked about those who said the country didn't need another Bush in the White House.

He was candid. ""In many ways the name is a plus and some ways the name is a burden, and you just described one of the burdens.""

But then he added, ""The environment is what it is. You don't get to rewrite the environment. And so Jeb has to think about whether or not he wants to be president.""

Which brings us to 2016.

When he launched his campaign, Jeb Bush would often be asked about his brother and his father. He declared that he was running as his own man, but kept tripping on the family legacy. Especially Iraq. Bush had a hard time articulating what he would have done, and he wouldn't criticize his brother.

George W. made a very rare campaign appearance with him at a rally in North Charleston last week. His 90-year-old mother, Barbara, also hit the trail with Jeb. They both remain popular with South Carolina voters and were very enthusiastically received, but to no avail.

The biggest problem was that Jeb Bush seemed to be running the kind of race that might have worked in his father's or his brother's time  but not now. The Republican Party has changed dramatically  moving to the right and rejecting the establishment. The ground was shifting right under Bush's feet.

Over the weekend, you could hear Jeb Bush finally coming to terms with that as he wrapped up the final speech of a disappointing journey.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, everybody.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Hey, if you are listening to this show today, you know that we took the week off. If you're listening to this show in the future, know that the world was green and verdant before the election of Donald Trump.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: And that back in these happy pre-Trump days, we enjoyed asking our panelists questions about the news, like these...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SAGAL: Roxanne, good news. Bloomberg News reports that senior citizens are more active than ever. Specifically, senior citizens are doing a whole lot more what?

ROXANNE ROBERTS: Having sex.

SAGAL: No.

ROBERTS: They're not?

SAGAL: I wouldn't know. I'm not yet that old.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Here is your hint. Your hint could be, I want 20,000 in unmarked, large print bills.

ROBERTS: Robbing banks?

SAGAL: Robbing banks, apparently.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

ROBERTS: No, really?

SAGAL: That's what senior citizens are up to.

ROBERTS: Wait. Wait.

SAGAL: Grandma apparently wants her purse filled, finally, with something other than crumpled up Kleenexes and cough drops. According to Bloomberg News, there's a big rise in bank and jewel heists by senior citizens. Most notable is Germany's Grandpa Gang. They've robbed 12 banks, and they nearly botched one of their getaways because - and this is true - one of the desperados had to keep stopping to pee.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You've got to pull over. We just stopped. No, I've got to pull over. The police are right on our tail.

TOM BODETT: Well, criminals grow old, too.

SAGAL: That's true.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: They're not going to learn any...

BODETT: But I don't think it's like old people suddenly turned bad. It's like bad people suddenly turn old.

npr,,Words We Get Wrong: The List,[],"Words We Get Wrong: The List

We speak and write well most of the time.

There are, however, words and phrases that trip us up. Listeners, readers and our colleagues cringe at the mistakes.

This is going to be a living post. Were starting with some of the common mistakes. There are some links to where you can get help on the proper usages. Well add to the list as suggestions  perhaps we should say complaints  come in. The hope is that if the problem cases are identified, theyll become less common as times goes on.

 Advance planning: One of many pleonasms we should avoid.

 Anniversary: It is redundant to say one-year or five-year or 10-year ... anniversary.



 Begs the question: If you think that means raises the question, you will incur the wrath of dozens or more audience members.

 But: Its a little word we use far too often and in ways we shouldnt.

-- Countless: Do you really mean there are too many to count? Or that theres an indefinitely large number? Should you be saying hundreds or thousands?



 Data: At NPR, we use plural verbs and pronouns when referring to data  unless, that is, were confident were using the word as a collective noun. Tip: If you can substitute the word information, thats a sign youre using data as a collective noun. If the word numbers is the proper substitute, than you need plural verbs and pronouns.

 Farther and further: Use farther when discussing distances. Further is for issues involving matters of degree.

 Fewer or less? Do you choose your supermarket based on what the sign says over the express aisle? Some people do. Fewer is the word to use when things can be counted. Less is to be used when when youre talking about mass quantities.

 Interpreters and translators: An interpreter turns spoken words into another language. A translator works with written words.

 Lay and lie: Stop and check yourself before choosing between these words. Go here or here. At the very least, remember this: You lay down a book; you lie down to rest.

 Lecterns and podiums: You stand on a podium. You put your notes on a lectern, which you sit or stand behind.



 Marine, sailor, soldier: A Marine is not a soldier or a sailor. A sailor is not a Marine or a soldier. A soldier is not a sailor or a Marine. Be careful when referring to them.

 Media: NPR treats media as a plural.

 Percent and percentage point: When comparing changes in two percentages, the difference is expressed in percentage points. For example, if 36% of Little Valley Central Schools class of 76 show up at next years reunion, that will be an increase of 5 percentage points from the 31% turnout 10 years ago. Attendance, though, will go up 15%. Thats because the 15 who come next year would mark a 15% increase from the 13 who attended in 06.

 Reticent and reluctant: They do not mean the same thing. Websters defines reticent as habitually silent or uncommunicative; disinclined to speak readily; reserved; taciturn and having a restrained, quiet or understated quality.



 Shrink, shrank and shrunk; sink, sank and sunk: William Safire weighed in on these words back in 1995. Tip: The movie should have been called Honey, I Shrank the Kids.

 Vast majority: The best advice is to just not say it. Youll probably be wrong. Use facts instead.

(Memmos; Nov. 3, 2015)","['word', 'plural', 'list', 'sailor', 'soldier', 'wrong', 'words', '15', 'percentage', 'data', 'say', 'marine']"
npr,,"In The Vast Majority Of Cases, Are We Sure We Should Use Those Words?",[],"In The Vast Majority Of Cases, Are We Sure We Should Use Those Words?

What do you think when you hear the phrase vast majority?

Here are some of the answers I got today from 15 correspondents, hosts and editors on the third and fourth floors:

 More than two-thirds.

 At least three-quarters.

 Above 90 percent.

 Nearly all.

 A lot.

 A @#$%load.

 A boatload.

 A phrase that shouldnt be heard.

 An amorphous phrase that means we dont know how many for sure, but we think its a lot. 

The Urban Dictionary, meanwhile, offers a definition that begins with this: Possibly the most over-used, tired and tautological phrase ever to have survived in the English language.

Thankfully, a search indicates that the phrase vast majority doesnt make it into our stories every day.

But it was still heard 202 times in the past year. The odds are a bit better than 50-50 that it will be said in the next 24 hours.

Thats a problem.

After all, since we cant seem to agree on what the words mean or when they should be put together, it seems reasonable to conclude that listeners arent sure either. Whats more, attaching the word vast to majority is a judgment call. Whos saying its a vast majority? Whats the proof? Maybe its just a significant majority. Or a sizeable one. Or just a majority.

When possible, the best course is to use facts rather than just the vast majority label. Establish, for example, that

92 percent of those surveyed agreed and then, perhaps, talk about what such a vast majority means.

This brings to mind other guidance about:

 Avoiding cliches.

 Labels.

 Killing adjectives.

 Precision writing and editing.

 Words that get abused.

Note: My thanks to listener/reader Anne Sovik for suggesting we look into vast majority.

npr,2014-06-17 00:00:00,"By Dragon, Drugs Or Giant Peach, Fantastic Trips For Every Reader : NPR",[],"Have you read the biography of Crockett Johnson and his wife, Ruth Krauss, the creative geniuses who transformed children's literature? No, me neither, because I've been busy reading their compact, torn, slightly damp (how did it get that way?) board book to my own budding geniuses. Spoiler alert: Harold, a mere child, has left his bedroom. Don't worry. He ""think[s] it over for some time."" What's more, he has gone by way of an oversized purple crayon. Here's the thing you might not remember about Harold if a short human hasn't sat on your lap in a while  he gets into some real scrapes. Sure, there are the unlimited pies, and a trip to the big city, but there's also a dragon, a near drowning and a quick descent off a mountain. And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created  that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made. Harold draws the sea that swallows him and the boat that saves him. And when he gets home again  who can be sure that the bedroom he's drawn, with the moon in the window, is the same one he left? It isn't, really  and that's OK. It's still home  even when something's changed  even when you've changed. And of course, the question that still haunts me: Is Harold going to step on the crayon when he wakes up? That purple's going to leave a mark on the carpet. (For ages 3 to 7)

Looking at crimes from a different angle has become something of a trope these days  The Girl on the Train, anyone?

However, clever though Paula Hawkins' novel was, modern writers did not invent the alternate perspective. Think Rear Window, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Rebecca. Murder does make voyeurs of us all (as Hamlet didn't quite say).

The ultimate voyeur may be the reporter. Fiona Barton spent years writing for Britain's Daily Mail and Telegraph newspapers, and her journalistic eye is what makes this debut novel so assured and compelling. This is no small feat, given that both the crime and the death of the man convicted of it happen by page three, leaving several narrators to fill readers in on the backstory and its loose threads.

Glen Taylor was taken into custody for the abduction and disappearance of a toddler named Bella. The charges officially dismissed, he returns home to the semi-detached where his wife Jean has remained, despite being shunned by the community that knows Glen's computer contained evidence of his sexual predilections. ""No one wanted to know us now,"" says Jean. ""They just wanted to know about us.""

Had he but lived, Glen Taylor's might have become a familiar story: The shadowy, creepy neighbor who rarely goes out and isn't trusted around anyone's children. When he's run over by a bus, however, a London reporter and a local detective realize Jean Taylor's side of the story is up for grabs.

Their pursuit of Jean's tale propels The Widow, but its strength rests on her bowed shoulders. ""Must be a reporter,"" she says when Kate Waters from the Daily Post shows up. ""I bet she says 'I'm sorry to bother you at such a difficult time.' They all say that and put on that stupid face. Like they care."" Kate ""seems to be in charge of things,"" Jean muses. ""It's quite nice to have someone in charge of me again. I was beginning to think I'd have to cope with everything on my own.""

Barton, a seasoned reporter herself, understands the power of previously silent voice, as well as the frustration involved when that voice won't speak up. Bella is still missing, and her mother galvanizes a campaign to find her that puts pressure on the police and media. Some of the book's best moments illuminate how stressful it is to solve a case: Kate's constant travel and nights in hotel rooms, or Detective Inspector Bob Sparkes attempting to have a simple supper with his wife.

Kate may be manipulating Jean to get her story, but Jean has her own agenda; she's manipulating Kate right back. Their psychological fan dance winds up more obscene than anything on Glen Taylor's hard drive, as it delays discovery of the truth  and Barton shows that anguish by including chapters from the perspective of Bella Taylor's mother, Dawn.

A few critics have noted that Barton tips her hand too soon. While that might be a first-time novelist's mistake, it might also be the deliberate work of a professional observer who knows that the lies we tell ourselves can be more devastating than those we tell others.

Please use the phrase temporary protective status, not temporary legal status, when referring to the provisions of DACA and DAPA.

Denice Rios advises that:

The term temporary legal status when it comes to DACA (Deferred Action for childhood Arrivals) ... keeps popping up and it isnt accurate. ... We all look for easy ways to describe complicated bureaucracy. But using the word legal even when preceded by temporary is problematic. DACA offers some benefits, like a work permit or a reprieve from deportation, but it doesnt offer all the benefits one would receive if one were here legally. Thats why temporary protective status or simply offering an example or two of what the actions offer are better ways to explain DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parental Accountability).","['status', 'protective', 'temporary', 'offer', 'ways', 'daca', 'legal', 'deferred', 'action', 'benefits']"

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

Harper Lee's longtime friend Wayne Flynt will be delivering the eulogy at her funeral. He joins us on the line from Monroeville. Welcome, Mr. Flynt, and I'm so sorry for your and I guess all of our loss.

WAYNE FLYNT: Yeah, I think it's a sort of global loss, given the popularity of the novel across the world.

WERTHEIMER: Can you give us a sense about your friendship with Harper Lee? You have been in very close contact with her in the last years of her life.

FLYNT: That's correct. On average, once a month for the last 10 years since her stroke, we have sat and talked and told stories and exchanged insults...

(LAUGHTER)

FLYNT: ...Which she loves. I think one secret to our friendship was I did not treat her like a marble woman, and my wife - I joked with her, and I joked with her, and that was the sort of contours of our friendship.

WERTHEIMER: What's been on her mind, do you think, at - toward the end of her life? What was on her mind?

FLYNT: I would say what was always on her mind was the stories she had to tell, and the story was pretty obvious in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" maybe a bit - little bit less obvious and more obscure in ""Go Set A Watchman.""

WERTHEIMER: Which was a new - an unpublished book, which was just published recently.

FLYNT: Yes, that's right. It was actually her first book, but people can't get their heads around the fact that the central story she wanted to tell was the story of ""Go Set A Watchman."" And then when her editor and her agent tells America, who's not quite ready for that story, and I'm not sure America is ready for that story in 2016, as a matter of fact. She recast this story and the brilliant characterizations of the three children into a different book, and that became ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""

WERTHEIMER: There's been so much written about Harper Lee, and one of the things that you read over and over again is that she was famously reclusive. Is there something about her that we may not know and you think we ought to know?

FLYNT: Yes, she was legendarily private. I've never known such a private woman in my life. It's no surprise that she left Monroeville, a gossipy little southern town where everybody wants to know everybody's business, and went to the most anonymous city in America.

WERTHEIMER: New York City.

FLYNT: And she loved New York City. She gloried in being able to go to Broadway and people not recognize her, eating out and not having people come up to the table to remind her that their grandmother had been in school with her (laughter). She felt this world down here was a claustrophobic world.

WERTHEIMER: Do think that Ms. Lee took great satisfaction in knowing that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" really deeply affected many generations of Americans, it was read by millions of students?

FLYNT: Oh, yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I constantly tell audiences all over the world that the single greatest icon of American culture from the publication of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was that novel so that if we say, what conversation can we have that would lead us on a road of tolerance, and teachers have decided that if you're going to teach values in a school in America, the answer that American teachers at all kinds of schools have come up with, just let Harper Lee teach ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" And then all the teacher has to do is stand back and guide the discussion.

WERTHEIMER: Wayne Flynt will deliver the eulogy at Harper Lee's funeral. Mr. Flynt, thank you very much for speaking with us and again, so sorry that you've lost such a good friend.

FLYNT: Yes, and so is the world.

Felix Contreras and Jasmine Garsd host the weekly podcast about Latino arts and culture. They come bearing gifts of music to heat up the remaining cold winter days.

JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Hi.

MARTIN: So Jasmine, you're not a lover of winter, are you?

GARSD: Um, I like the activities associated with winter, like hot chocolate...

MARTIN: (Laughter).

GARSD: ...And movies, but no. I'm...

MARTIN: I thought you were going to say, like, skiing and sledding...

GARSD: Yeah, I'm - like, I'm South American, so...

MARTIN: It's never going to be your season.

GARSD: ...This is not for me. It's never going to be my season. But I get to listen to summer, spring-styled jams. This is one of my favorite DJ duos. It's Tropkillaz from Brazil. It's DJ Zegon and Andre Laudz. Oh, man - I follow them on Soundcloud, and every time they drop a new track, it's just awesome. Check it out.

MARTIN: I love it. I love that one.

CONTRERAS: Yeah, (unintelligible) it's awesome.

MARTIN: That's super cool. OK, Felix.

CONTRERAS: Top that?

MARTIN: Top that.

CONTRERAS: OK. Well, I'm from California, so I brought a California band to remind me of the warm central California sun - not as boisterous or as exciting or as moving as the track we just heard. But it's a new track from one of our favorite bands La Santa Cecilia. And they have a new album coming out. It's called ""Buenaventura,"" and this track is called ""Nunca Mas.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""NUNCA MAS"")

LA SANTA CECILIA: (Singing) Uno de tanta culpa se queda mudo, otros tienen memoria para olvidar. Si la violencia es en espejo que se rompe, y nuestra lagrimas caidas gritaran. Solo recuerda que mi cara tiene un nombre. Y nunca mas se callara. Y nunca mas se callara.

CONTRERAS: So this is a different kind of heat.

MARTIN: Yeah, but there - that soul in that voice - that's good.

CONTRERAS: Oh, yeah. Well, Marisol's voice is always going to raise the temperature. They're on a very solid trajectory through the music industry right now. They've gone from playing small clubs to bigger venues. They have fans like Elvis Costello among their following, and also, the band members have sort of settled into the life of traveling musicians, you know. They've gotten married. They've had kids. Marisol had her first baby. And to me, all of that reflects maturity, and this album shows it perfectly. Don't miss it, ""Buenaventura.""

MARTIN: All right. So let's close it out with one more song, Jasmine.

GARSD: Well, like you said, I've been in a tropical mood.

MARTIN: Aren't you always?

GARSD: I guess so.

MARTIN: You kind of are.

GARSD: I brought in this Dominican trio Mula. And the song ""Retumba."" And I have to shout out to the awesome blog that I found it on, ""Remezcla,"" which turned me on to them. This is a Dominican trio. They're doing something really cool with a rhythm from the Caribbean which you're going to hear right now, which is dembow.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""RETUMBA"")

MULA: (Singing in Spanish).

CONTRERAS: That rhythm - it's so repetitive. It can be annoying, but a lot of people are using that rhythm and then adding a lot of different things to it. That rhythm is, like - it's so malleable and a lot of fun.

MARTIN: It seems like a party starter. That's kind of like...

CONTRERAS: And it's definitely a party starter, for sure.

MARTIN: ...The beginning of a good time.

OK, everyone. You can download Alt.Latino from wherever you get your podcasts and, of course, from the NPR One app.

Since these brothers get along so well, we've asked them to take a break from writing, directing, acting and producing to play a game called ""Hating you is like hating myself."" Three questions about brothers who didn't see eye to eye.

Some siblings find it hard just to be under the same roof, but Mark and Jay Duplass have teamed up to make more than a dozen films. They've recently branched out into television with their HBO show Togetherness.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

And now the game where we ask people who do a lot of interesting things to do something dull. It's called Not My Job. If you turned on your TV recently, especially to premium cable, and you saw a smart, funny, kind of sad movie or TV show about people struggling with family relationships - shows like ""Transparent"" or ""The League"" or ""Togetherness,"" chances are you saw a Duplass brother. Jay and Mark Duplass are writers, directors, actors and brothers. And they join us now. Jay and Mark Duplass, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

(APPLAUSE)

JAY DUPLASS: Thank you.

SAGAL: All right...

MARK DUPLASS: Is that applause all for us?

BILL KURTIS: Yes.

SAGAL: It is. It's for you. So let me ask you something, how do we tell you apart to begin with?

M. DUPLASS: You don't.

J. DUPLASS: You don't.

SAGAL: Really? Is this...

M. DUPLASS: We look very different, but we have the same exact voice, so you guys are just screwed.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I mean, we were wondering 'cause we were thinking oh, the Duplasses are on the show - like the Duplassey (ph), like Duplasseyi (ph). Do you have a plural to describe you guys?

J. DUPLASS: We have been referred to as the Dupli (ph). That is our preferred method of plural reference.

SAGAL: All right, the Dupli.

MAZ JOBRANI: Not the Duplasse (ph)?

M. DUPLASS: It's got a certain Latin flavor. I believe it's ablative plural.

SAGAL: Yeah.

M. DUPLASS: Yeah.

SAGAL: If you were Jewish, you would be the Duplassim (ph), I guess.

MO ROCCA: Duplassim, yeah.

SAGAL: Yeah, now...

JOBRANI: (Singing) Duplassim, Duplassam, life goes on. La, la, la, la, life goes on.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So you guys basically - it is impossible now to turn on a television and not see you. So let me ask you this - I mean, everybody knows the Coen brothers and they have certain hallmarks in their films, a kind of quirky humor, certain kind of themes. How - is there, like, a Duplasse brothers themes or formula that you could describe that holds your work together?

M. DUPLASS: Well, we - the other - I guess it was a few months ago, we were approached about doing kind of - kind of like a big action-ey kind of movie. And we said, we would be open to that if you are willing to have your main villain stop in the middle of a car chase, get out, sit on the sidewalk and talk about his feelings to his mother for 10 minutes straight. And they said, I don't think we make that movie. And we said, well, that's what Duplassian is called. That's what we do.

SAGAL: Yeah, it's like Kubrickian had a certain kind of cold, austere sense to it. But Duplassian means people basically just being inarticulate about their feelings.

M. DUPLASS: And crying a lot.

SAGAL: Crying a lot.

J. DUPLASS: Our autobiography would be ""Feelings And The People Who Feel Them.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ""The Duplass Story.""

ROCCA: Could that be a mumblecore superhero?

SAGAL: Oh, yeah, I wanted to ask you about that because I said oh, we're having the Duplass brothers on the show. And the person said oh, you mean the mumblecore pioneers? Because apparently, some people call your genre of filmmaking mumblecore - people mumbling their feelings to each other over a period of time.

M. DUPLASS: I mean, when I first heard that word, I just assumed it was, like, referring to some sort of pretty extreme pornographic trend in the Nordic regions...

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: ...And I don't know how it applies to us.

ROCCA: I thought it referred to the parents in the ""Peanuts"" cartoons.

M. DUPLASS: Oh, yeah, there you go, yeah...

ROCCA: The way they talk - (imitating ""Peanuts"" mumbling).

J. DUPLASS: That was the original mumble core.

SAGAL: Yeah. Well, Jay and Mark Duplass, we have asked you here to play game we're calling...

KURTIS: Hating You Is Like Hating Myself.

SAGAL: So you guys get along really well, which is great. In fact, you get along so well, it's a little weird. So we thought we'd ask you about pairs of brothers who hate each other. Answer two questions about those and you will win our prize for one of our listeners -- Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail, berating his evil brother, Bob Kasell. Bill, who are the Duplass brothers playing for?

KURTIS: Jean Allen of New Orleans, La.

SAGAL: All right, Mark and Jay, he is your first question. Which of these famous people had a feud with their brother? Was it A, Leonardo da Vinci, who was constantly being confused with his brother Guillermo da Vinci, who was a house painter, B, the comedian Gallagher, who ended up suing his own brother Ron Gallagher, aka Gallagher II, for stealing his famous Sledge-O-Matic bit or C, Jerome Flatley, brother of the Irish ""Lord Of The Dance"" Michael Flatley, who advertised himself, quote, ""as the one who moves his arms, too.""

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: You see, ""The Secret,"" where you use the secret and you will things into being - ""The Secret"" wants me to choose C because I really want to see the Flatley feud happen on stage someday.

SAGAL: That would be awesome. It would be like Jerome Flatley dancing and fighting with his brother Michael Flatley, and Jerome Flatley keeps hitting him with his arms and Michael Flatley can't do that because he can't move his arms.

J. DUPLASS: Because we've all been waiting for that dance-off where they actually do punch each other.

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: I'm feeling B. How about you?

J. DUPLASS: I'm feeling B.

SAGAL: You're right. It was, in fact, Gallagher.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

M. DUPLASS: Oh, yes.

SAGAL: Gallagher sued his brother.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Gallagher sued Gallagher II for copyright infringement. Next question - recently, The New York Times featured an article on identical twins who are engaged in a lifelong feud. Who are they? Are they A, Mikkel and Jeppe Bjergso, identical twin Danish genius craft brewers who loathe each others beers, B, Giovanni and Christian Reyardi of Brazil, who are competing Frank Sinatra impersonators, or C, Marvin and Irving Frankel, the two competing rabbis of Chicken, Alaska, competing to attract the town's only other Jew to their synagogue.

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: Something tells me the way that bearded Nordic men feel about their alcohol could be the deepest thing on the planet.

J. DUPLASS: And that the lifelong feud has been fueled by hops...

(LAUGHTER)

J. DUPLASS: ...And wheat.

M. DUPLASS: And wheat. So...

J. DUPLASS: Perhaps they are gluten intolerant as well.

(LAUGHTER)

J. DUPLASS: I...

SAGAL: By the way, for people who have not seen any of the Duplass brothers' films, this is it. This is basically - this could be a scene.

M. DUPLASS: As good as it gets in the mumblecore Duplassian genre.

(LAUGHTER)

J. DUPLASS: We retain the rights to this episode...

M. DUPLASS: Yeah.

J. DUPLASS: ...By the way.

SAGAL: I understand.

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: Let's not think about it. Let's count to three and say a letter. One, two, three...

M. DUPLASS AND J. DUPLASS: A.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You're right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: That's it.

J. DUPLASS: Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Said Jeppe Bjergso of his brother Mikkel's blueberry beer, quote, I think it's disgusting. It tastes like Kool-Aid. This really actually is your next film - two craft brewers who hate each other.

J. DUPLASS: It's incredible.

M. DUPLASS: Well, because what's going to be so amazing is that moment right around minute 70 when Giuseppe (ph) finds his brother, who has been criticizing his blueberry beer the whole time...

SAGAL: Yeah.

M. DUPLASS: ...Secretly enjoying it lasciviously in the garage. And then he cries to him and says I always knew you were better than me.

SAGAL: Oh, man.

JOBRANI: Wow, nice.

SAGAL: All right, last question - sometimes siblings have to come up with creative ways to express their distaste for each other, like when a man in Florida did what? A, used his mom's obituary in the newspaper to talk smack about his siblings...

JOBRANI: Hilarious.

SAGAL: ...B, change his name from Anthony Goodson to The Goodson...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...Or C, bought his brother's favorite bar in Tampa just so he could ban him from ever coming in.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: Ooh...

M. DUPLASS: I have a very strong feeling here that it's A or C. I put B away in my brain.

J. DUPLASS: I agree.

M. DUPLASS: I put Mr. The away. I want see to be it very, very badly.

J. DUPLASS: I want C to be it. I would like the rights to that story...

M. DUPLASS: Oh, it's so beautiful.

SAGAL: Seriously, they're going to leave this show with two more TV series ready to go.

(LAUGHTER)

J. DUPLASS: I'm leaning heavily towards A, however.

M. DUPLASS: Yeah. And you know what? Just because we're here and we want people to know how things really work between us, sometimes we disagree. I'm going with C.

J. DUPLASS: Ooh.

SAGAL: Oh, well, not only have you disagreed, now we have to see how you resolve your disagreement because you've got to pick one.

M. DUPLASS: Right now, Jay Duplass is dead.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, actually, I think what...

M. DUPLASS: It makes sense.

SAGAL: I think what we're going to do is because you've already won the game, I think we'll do this. So which of you picked A? Who wanted A?

M. DUPLASS: Jay picks A.

SAGAL: Jay picks A, so that means that Mark picks C?

M. DUPLASS: Yes.

SAGAL: All right, and in this particular instance, Jay wins. It was a.

M. DUPLASS: He's dead.

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: (Unintelligible).

SAGAL: Well, not only is he dead but so was this woman. Her name was Josie Anello. And her obituary, as printed in the local paper, read in part, quote, ""she is survived by her son A.J., who cared for her, and her son Peter, who broke her heart.

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: Yes.

JOBRANI: That's great.

M. DUPLASS: Oh...

J. DUPLASS: Oh, man...

SAGAL: Totally harsh.

J. DUPLASS: So let's talk about the rights to C and...

(LAUGHTER)

M. DUPLASS: We'll be wrapping that up shortly.

SAGAL: There you are. Bill, how did the Duplass brothers do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, we have two contestants, so we'll have to give them an asterisk. But three is a perfect score. So congratulations, brothers...

M. DUPLASS: Thank you

J. DUPLASS: Thank you very much.

KURTIS: ...You won.

ROCCA: You got two and half, two and a half.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: The Duplass brother's show ""Animals"" airs on Fridays on HBO and ""Togetherness"" premiers on Sunday February 21, also on HBO. Jay and Mark Duplass, thank you so much for playing with us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

J. DUPLASS: Thanks for having us.

M. DUPLASS: Thanks guys.

J. DUPLASS: It was fun.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""HE AIN'T HEAVY, HE'S MY BROTHER"")

THE HOLLIES: (Singing) The road is long with many a winding turn.

SAGAL: In just a minute, it's been one week since we last played limericks. And we have a lot to confess. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back in a bit with more of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME from NPR.

Our panelists predict what will be the big surprise out of the 2016 Super Bowl.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Now panel, what will be the big surprise at the big game? Alonzo Bodden.

ALONZO BODDEN: The shocking thing - just like the Oscars, there'll be no black winners.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Helen Hong.

HELEN HONG: Marco Rubio will give a Katy Perry-style halftime performance, complete with fireworks, sequined outfits and Rand Paul and Rick Santorum dancing backup in shark costumes.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That would actually be awesome.

BILL KURTIS: That would be good.

SAGAL: Roy Blount, Jr.

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: A wide receiver makes a leaping, one-finger catch. And there it is. There's nowhere else to go from there.

Sometimes silence speaks loudest. That certainly seems to be the case with ""Bed Down"" from Penny & Sparrow's Let a Lover Drown You. Like most of the other songs on the Austin folk-rock duo's third album (and Thirty Tigers debut), ""Bed Down"" is delivered with the most sparse production possible, utilizing only those sonic elements absolutely necessary to get the point across. For the first two minutes, Andy Baxter's butterscotch baritone and Kyle Jahnke's harmony are accompanied by little more than an acoustic guitar and its echoes  and the open (but not empty) spaces in the arrangement allow plenty of room for the song's melancholy mood to subtly, organically grow in intensity.

""One of the many things we learned from our producer [ex-Civil Wars singer John Paul White] was to focus on the actual song first and the arrangement second,"" explains Jahnke. ""Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the production of a song. We liked the idea of using space as a tool, just as you would with rich and full arrangements. Doing so really lets the big moments in the album shine.""

Lyrically, ""Bed Down"" maintains a delicate dance between heartache and resolve. Even as the character at the center of its story seems overcome by sadness, he keeps pushing towards the light at the end of the tunnel. ""This song is about having to remind yourself that you have moved on from an ex-lover,"" says Jahnke. ""Sometimes it's hard to remember that."" Even though Baxter is ostensibly addressing the architect of his heartbreak in the song's second-person perspective, it eventually becomes clear that he's really just talking to himself, laying the whole sad story out in order to motivate himself to let go. It's surely no coincidence that Jahnke's harmony vocals first appear with the key cathartic line ""I know you never gave a damn about me,"" arriving just in time to offer some brotherly solidarity.

The melody of ""Bed Down"" has a dramatic but unconventional flow which edges closer to art-song than pop. And the track's dynamics mirror the ebb and flow of the emotions it stirs up, reaching their peak when Baxter declares himself definitively done with the past, then riding out gently as he and Jahnke join together to quietly but firmly repeat ""no more"" several times at the tune's coda.

P.S. Don't infer from all this emotional intensity that these guys are humorless. When asked how the one-time roommates at University of Texas came up with their sobriquet, Jahnke wryly explains, ""Our other roommate used to write short stories under the alias Penny and Sparrow. After we took his life we took the band name for ourselves. Just kidding, we didn't kill him. Or did we?""

Let a Lover Drown You is out March 11 on Single Lock/Thirty Tigers.","['jahnke', 'song', 'tigers', 'penny', 'took', 'bed', 'courtesy', 'sparrow', 'really', 'songs']"

toggle caption Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images

With a Hail Mary move, Denny Hamlin ended Joe Gibbs' 23-year drought at the Daytona 500.

Gibbs made it clear that he had no use for the victories his drivers collected in the exhibition races leading into Sunday's season-opener. The three-time Super Bowl winning coach was focused only on the ""Great American Race"" and his four drivers brainstormed on the best way to get a win for Gibbs.

Hamlin, Matt Kenseth, Carl Edwards and reigning NASCAR champion Kyle Busch stuck close together for most of the race, and they got assistance from Martin Truex Jr., who became a de facto JGR teammate this year when Furniture Row Racing moved to Toyota.

Kenseth was out front and leading Truex until the final lap when Hamlin finally jumped out of line to make his attempt at the win. Starting a second line on the outside, Hamlin got a push from Kevin Harvick that allowed him to catch Kenseth. Kenseth tried to throw a block but Hamlin wedged into the middle between Kenseth and Truex and Kenseth had to save his car from wrecking.

""The last thing I wanted to do was wreck off turn four with my Toyota teammates and none of us win,"" Hamlin said. ""We had talked about a plan overnight to just work together, work together and I've never seen it executed so flawlessly.

""I said with two to go that we have to get the team victory no matter what it takes and I essentially was trying to go up there and block (Harvick) to keep him from getting to those guys.""

But the push from Harvick was so strong, Hamlin was able to catch Kenseth and Truex. Once Kenseth was out of the way, Hamlin raced Truex side-by-side to the checkered flag for a photo finish. The margin of victory was 0.010 seconds, the closest in race history.

""I don't know where that came from, I don't know what happened, I can't even figure out what I did,"" Hamlin said. ""It all just came together. But this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for Toyotas sticking together all race long.""

It was Hamlin's first Daytona 500 victory and first for Toyota. Gibbs, who in November celebrated with Busch the team's first Sprint Cup title in a decade, won the Daytona 500 for the first time since Dale Jarrett in 1993.

Truex, who spun the loss as a positive in that he proved to JGR that he and Furniture Row Racing will be strong partners, wasn't sure what he could have done differently.

""It hurts a little bit,"" Truex said. ""We were in the right spot, we made the right moves. You can second-guess all day long, the only thing I could have done different was be more aggressive to the line.""

Toyotas swept the podium as Truex was second, and Busch third. Carl Edwards was fifth as Toyota took four of the top five spots.

""Great day for Joe Gibbs Racing, really pumped for Joe to get back to victory lane here in the Daytona 500,"" said Busch. ""I figured it was five to go that it was every man for himself. Once Denny jumped up, he just got such a huge boost from (Harvick). Once he did it, I swore I thought about doing it. Once I thought about doing it and didn't do it, it was too late. That was it. You can't think that long and not make the move at the same time.""

Kenseth faded to 14th.

""They don't get much more crushing than that,"" Kenseth said.

Dale Earnhardt Jr., seeking his third Daytona 500 victory, came up empty as he tried to force his way through the field late in the race.

Earnhardt was using the high line to inch closer to the front, and when he tried to get a side draft from another car, he spun through the fourth turn. His Chevrolet hit an interior wall and then ricocheted into the grass, where Earnhardt found himself stuck.

Earnhardt was a heavy favorite to win and brought a car nicknamed ""Amelia Earhart"" that had appeared to be unbeatable. Amelia won four races  including a qualifier at Daytona earlier this week  and never finished lower than third in seven starts over the past year.

""Caught me by surprise there,"" Earnhardt said. ""We were making some ground on the leaders a little bit so that was looking pretty good because the outside line really hadn't been doing anything all day. Just busted my butt there. Driver mistake.""","['kenseth', 'daytona', 'harvick', 'wins', 'denny', 'hamlin', 'race', 'victory', 'win', 'line', 'busch', '500', 'truex']"

The Bialetti Moka Express revolutionized home coffee preparation worldwide. After the death of the company's executive, Renato Bialetti, last week, here's a history of the iconic appliance.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Finally, a morning ritual dear to many of us - I might even say essential is the making of morning coffee. That ritual varies depending on where you are. For Italians, the iconic coffee hardware is the Bialetti Moka Express. It's an eight-sided aluminum coffeemaker heated on the stove and embossed on the side with the image of a man with a mustache. This week, the world said goodbye to the man behind that image, Renato Bialetti. He died on February 11 in Switzerland. He was 93. With more than 200 million of these stovetop coffee makers in the world, Bialetti could be described as a Steve Jobs of stovetop coffeemakers. His father Alberto (ph) actually invented the Moka Express in the 1930s with inspiration from a surprising source.

CYNTHIA TROPE: Apparently, he was inspired by watching his wife do laundry. And it was sort of a primitive washing apparatus that involved a tub with a lid that had a tube. And he just had the brilliant idea to sort of translate this for coffee making.

MARTIN: Cynthia Trope is a curator with the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. She says the coffeemaker's sharp, art-deco design and use of aluminum suggested a cup of coffee from the future.

JEFFREY SCHNAPP: Alfonso may have been clever metallurgist, but he had no experience with design or marketing. And it was there that his son Renato became an absolute key figure in the worldwide success of the Moka Express.

MARTIN: That's Harvard professor Jeffrey Schnapp, who wrote about the history of the Bialetti. After World War II, Renato took his father's modest company and turned it into a coffee percolation empire.

SCHNAPP: Adopting what at the time were some really imaginative advertising techniques - Titanic-sized Moka Expresses were built to line the roads of the city of Milan at the time of the launch of the Moka's first campaigns.

MARTIN: He invested in billboards and television commercials urging Italians to make their coffee at home, promising an espresso just like a cafe.

(SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking Italian).

MARTIN: The strategy worked. Renato made the company into an international brand. Services for Renato Bialetti were held last week. His ashes were interred in - what else? - a giant Bialetti Moka Express.

When you think of tract homes, you think of houses that look the same: the same color scheme, the same style; homes that form two uninteresting walls on either side of a suburban street. That might be the case today, but nearly 60 years ago  at a time when ""real"" architects wouldn't touch tract homes  one architect did everything he could to break the monotony. His name is William Krisel, and he's being honored by a place whose look he helped define  Palm Springs, Calif.

The minute you see Krisel's homes, you're taken back to another era. They have distinctive angled roofs, high windows and desert color schemes with pops of rich gold or vibrant blue. They also have lots of glass and elegantly simple lines, a signature of all the houses in the city's Twin Palms tract neighborhood. One of those homes belongs to Heidi Creighton, and she knows just what she has. She says it's ""a Krisel-designed home, and it would be classified as a Model A-3 sunflap flat-roof tract house.""

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

Sitting in Creighton's living room, if you didn't see the flat screen TV, you'd swear it was 1962. The couch is angular and low to the ground. The wooden coffee table is kidney-shaped and rests on spindle legs. On an end table, there are glasses, a cocktail shaker and olive picks in their own stand.

""If you walked into my house,"" Creighton says, ""you would see a light-infused, glass house with very little distinction between the inside and the outside of the house. Materials are simple, and you're happy to be here. It feels good.""

In other words, it's consummate William Krisel. At 91, the architect himself lives in a condo in Beverly Hills with his wife of more than 60 years. Naturally, the condo is in a building he designed.

""At one point in my practice, of the 10 largest homebuilders in the United States, seven of the 10 were my clients,"" Krisel says. ""And I have had built, from my designs, over 40,000 living units, and that's more than any other architect that I know of.""

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

While his work is spread across the West, his Palm Springs houses proved that modernism could be livable and affordable. He notably designed several housing tracts for the Alexander Construction Co., which appreciated the way the homes could be built economically and with almost assembly-line efficiency.

Back in Twin Palms, around the corner from Heidi Creighton's house lives realtor Chris Menrad. Sitting poolside in the backyard of his agave-green house with a roof resembling the swoop of a check mark, he echoes Creighton's enthusiasm for the architect's design.

""There's a very big connection with the outdoors,"" Menrad says. ""There's lots of windows, lots of clerestory windows, so you're always kind of looking up and out, and you're always aware of what's going on outside, or weather  sunlight.""

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

Both Menrad and Creighton, who co-edited a new book on the architect, are picking up on the language of modernism. Like any language, Krisel says, it has basic tenets: ""that a house is more than just a shelter; that it is a way of improving your way of life; that it can open up a whole new concept in your feeling every day; that the indoors and the outdoors are inseparable; and that the climate and the flora and fauna and ecology are all encompassed in making your decisions on how to create this space.""

Krisel is also a landscape architect, so he had control over all design aspects. Plants were selected for shape and color; paint schemes and rooflines were varied so no two were too close together; and he varied the setbacks on each house to break the uninterrupted wall of homes found in most tract developments.

i toggle caption Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley Darren Bradley/Courtesy of Darren Bradley

But despite this meticulous attention to detail, many still considered them just tract homes. ""He was definitely sort of forgotten,"" Menrad says. In 1999, when Menrad began restoring his house, he was the exception. Now, Krisel says houses he designed throughout the Coachella Valley are being snapped up.

""One by one, I could find a house that somebody had restored properly, and then another one,"" he says. ""And now it's like a virus. Everybody in Palm Springs wants to do it.""

Ferrante Fever goes something like this: You pick up one of Elena Ferrante's books because a friend told you that you had to read it. You read a few pages, and then before you know it, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning, you've finished the book, and you're on the hunt for the other three titles in the Neapolitan series.

This cultural phenomenon comes our way via translation  the novels were translated from the Italian by New Yorker editor Ann Goldstein. Ferrante is famously private  she gives no interviews, no one knows who she is  so Goldstein has become an unintentional face of the series.

But just in case anyone was wondering if Goldstein is Ferrante, she'd like to clear that up right away: ""No, I am not. I can say that without equivocation,"" she tells NPR's Linda Wertheimer. ""And I can also say I don't know who she is.""

Goldstein learned Italian late in life. ""I had this sense that I wanted to read Dante in Italian,"" she says. So she signed up for an Italian class at The New Yorker.

Goldstein talks with Wertheimer about her recent projects; in addition to translating Ferrante's latest, The Story of the Lost Child, she's also translated Jhumpa Lahiri's In Other Words, and edited Primo Levi's complete works.

Interview Highlights

On trying to take a feeling from one language, and express it in another

Well naturally that's my goal. You can't possibly achieve that in a perfect way because there's so many things you have to take into consideration. You know, think about every word, every sentence, every paragraph, and do what you can.

On whether she liked the Neapolitan novels

I loved these books. ... It's really the story of a young woman, or two women, growing up in Naples in a poor neighborhood. The way that they get out of it  or don't get out of it  that's part of it. But it's also the story of the mid-20th century in Italy so it's really like a social, historical and personal novel. I think that even though I didn't live in Italy in those years, it did cover that same type of generational upbringing that someone like me might've had in America.

On her philosophy  or lack thereof  for approaching different writers

I don't have a philosophy. If I had a philosophy, it's that I'm kind of literal minded. For example, I would never translate poetry  it's too hard, there are too many levels. Not that prose doesn't have many levels, but it's more grounded. I like to think of the individual words, then you put the word in the sentence, then you have to think about what that word means in the sentence, then you have to read the sentence in the paragraph  you're sort of building up like that; that's my philosophy.

On how she thinks of her job  writer, collaborator, facilitator?

Enabler. My day job, I'm essentially a copy editor and I think there are certain similarities because you're dealing with words; you're trying to enable someone to express him or herself as much as he or she possibly can, and I think in a sense that's what translation is. You're expressing something that's originally in one language in another language.","['youre', 'word', 'way', 'novels', 'read', 'sentence', 'thats', 'think', 'translator', 'goldstein', 'job', 'words', 'enabler', 'ferrante', 'elena', 'italian']"

First there was ""Full House"" and now, more than 20 years later, the reboot of the family sitcom starts this week. NPR's Rachel Martin speaks to the show's creator, Jeff Franklin.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

It's a good year for television reboots. ""Twin Peaks,"" ""The X-Files,"" ""Gilmore Girls,"" and this week, ""Full House.""

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

MARY-KATE/ASHLEY OLSEN: (As Michelle Tanner) No way, Jose.

MARTIN: Yes way. The last new episode of the ABC sitcom was more than 20 years ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

JODIE SWEETIN: (As Stephanie Tanner) How rude.

MARTIN: But now Netflix is bringing it back for a 13-episode spinoff called ""Fuller House.""

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

DAVE COULIER: (As Joey Gladstone) Cut it out.

MARTIN: It's true. The updated version will feature most of the original cast.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

CANDACE CAMERON BUR: (As D. J. Tanner) Oh, Mylanta.

MARTIN: Along with - we hope - a healthy dose of their favorite catchphrases.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

JOHN STAMOS: (As Jesse Katsopolis) Have mercy.

MARTIN: Jeff Franklin created the original ""Full House"" and is the executive producer of ""Fuller House."" He joins us now from our studios at NPR West. Jeff, thanks so much for being with us.

JEFF FRANKLIN: It's my pleasure.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FULL HOUSE"")

OLSEN: (As Michelle Tanner) You got it, dude.

FRANKLIN: (Laughter). I recognize those voices.

MARTIN: Yeah, right? Thanks for bearing with us. We just couldn't resist. There are so many funny one-liners from that cast.

FRANKLIN: I love it.

MARTIN: (Laughter). OK, so for those of us out there - I don't know who they are - but who might not have as much '90s nostalgia as I do, let's just recap this. ""Full House"" was about a widower named Danny Tanner. And he was raising his three daughters with the help of his brother-in-law and also his best friend, who lived in the basement. And the last we saw of the Tanners, the eldest daughter, D. J., was about to go to prom. And the youngest daughter, Michelle, got her memory back after falling off a horse.

FRANKLIN: Yeah.

MARTIN: So then what happened? Where does ""Fuller House"" pick up the story?

FRANKLIN: Well, the new show begins in 2016, 20 years after the old show went off the air.

MARTIN: So what happens when you do that, when you mature people over years? Because it's one thing to remember D. J. and Stephanie and Michelle as these cute girls. And they were getting into, you know, cute girl problems - you know, bad grades or problems with boys. Adult life is way more complicated and sometimes not as funny.

FRANKLIN: Right. Well, the basic premise of this show is certainly not funny. D. J. finds herself widowed. I guess you could call it the Tanner course. She's at a crisis point in her life. It's the first time she's going to have to take care of these three boys by herself at the same time that she juggles a full-time career as a veterinarian. So she really has her plate full. And everybody is sort of taking off. And that's how we open the series, is she's alone with these kids.

MARTIN: So D. J. is in the same position now that Danny was in the beginning of ""Full House,"" right?

FRANKLIN: Correct.

MARTIN: So she's trying to raise her own kids with the help of her larger network.

FRANKLIN: Right, with the help of her sister, Stephanie, and her best friend, Kimmy Gibbler.

MARTIN: Why now?

FRANKLIN: The reason it's on right now is because this is when Netflix bought the show.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

FRANKLIN: I actually started all this back in 2007. So it's taken six years to set this up.

MARTIN: What was the feedback you got then?

FRANKLIN: This was not in the era of reboot fever at all. And I think that even though for me it seemed like a no-brainer - but perhaps they were nervous about having a show rest on the shoulders of three women who had not really been in a sitcom for 20 years. I don't know. Maybe they just thought, oh, this is some, you know, saccharin, cheesy relic from the '80s, and we're too cool for that.

MARTIN: To be honest, when you watch these reruns, they are those things. And that's what we love about them, right? Like...

FRANKLIN: Exactly.

MARTIN: It was a moment. It was a time. And do you then risk creating something new that isn't those things?

FRANKLIN: I think this show will feel a little more contemporary. But in the beginning, it was completely of a sort where you could see any number of shows like ""Full House."" You know, now ""Fuller House"" is all by itself. There is no other show on television like this, that is geared for the whole family and that is unabashedly family-friendly and... And it has a live audience. And it feels the same when you watch it as the old show even though, you know, some of the characters are new. And some of the problems are new. And obviously, you know, there are cell phones and computers. And it's not - it doesn't feel like 1987, like the old show does. But now we're all alone. And I'm hoping that there's a place somewhere in the TV landscape for a show like this. I think there is.

MARTIN: Jeff Franklin is the creator of ""Full House"" and ""Fuller House,"" which premieres on Netflix this week. Jeff, thanks so much for talking with us.

FRANKLIN: Oh, thank you very much.

The way recording engineer Michael Reilly tells it in the liner notes of Panola County Spirit, Raymond Walker, the eightysomething patriarch of the Walker Family of Como, Mississippi, was always a singer of some renown. In fact, he was once the leader of a locally legendary (though never recorded) gospel vocal group called The Longtime Travelers.

According to Reilly, both Sam Cooke and Fred McDowell tried to coax Walker to accompany them on tour in the early 1960s, and both were refused ""on account of [Walker's] family needing him at home."" Brother Raymond and Sister Joella Walker ended up having four daughters and two sons, and all but one daughter have followed in their parents' footsteps by singing spirituals. As history would now have it, they're more than mere ""singers."" The Walkers are closer to standard-bearers of an a cappella gospel-singing tradition, which is front-and-center on the album Reilly recorded mostly in 2007  and mostly in Raymond and Joella's living room.

Though barely more than a minute long, the call-and-response ""Jesus Gave Me Water"" is harmonically rich beyond its time constraint. Unlike much of the album, it features the entire singing Family  including the children, Alberta, Bobby, Delouse, Patricia and Robert  participating in the seven-part uplift, with Raymond leading and the others following. The song itself, written by Lucie Campbell, one of the giant composers of African-American religious songs of the mid-20th century, tells the story from the Gospel of John, wherein Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, offering her a drink of the water of eternal life.

The Walkers take it at a mid-tempo, foot-stomping stride  more straightforward than the popular Soul Stirrers version  with Raymond Walker's worn-down but still powerful voice expressing the nuance, both the initial thirst and the salvation, while the chorus punctuates the tale and the meaning. It's effortless and masterful, the kind of performance that feels as natural as breathing. Which is why it could hardly be more powerful.

There have been a couple times this week when corrections were added to Web pages without input from the correspondents or bloggers who committed the alleged infractions. In one case, we had to correct our correction because the blogger was right the first time. (On the plus side, at least we were recognized as having posted the Holy Grail of corrections. )

Weve written before about our corrections process.

Other reference materials:

 A How We Make Corrections memo.

 A document called A Common Corrections Scenario.

This note is a reminder that when we think an error has been made, the people who did the work need to be notified immediately so that they can help determine if it really was a mistake. Heres a key step in our process:

If you suspect an error, talk and/or send a message to the reporter/blogger/correspondent who was responsible, and the desk editor/producer or show editor/producer who handled the piece, 2-way or Web text. This is important: Include a link to the story and details about what show or blog is involved. This is also important: Make sure you cc Mark Memmott, the DMEs, Susan Vavrick and Corrections@npr.org.

Obviously, if its a glaringly obvious and serious error, we need to get the digital text fixed as soon as possible and may not be able to wait for input from those who worked on the story. But they should still be notified immediately. Also, those who are on the receiving end of a message about a possible error need to respond as soon as possible.

Give Rolling Stone some credit for transparency. Sean Penns account of his trip to meet Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is topped with this editors note:

Disclosure: Some names have had to be changed, locations not named, and an understanding was brokered with the subject that this piece would be submitted for the subjects approval before publication. The subject did not ask for any changes.

Theres a good discussion to be had about the line between activism and journalism and how far across it the El Chapo Speaks piece goes. Lets set that aside for now.

This post is about two simpler issues.

First, NPR does not create pseudonyms for sources. Doing so gives the audience a reason to ask what else might have been made up. If we need to protect someones identity, we most often use real first names, sometimes real middle names, sometimes real street or nicknames that the source is known by and sometimes descriptions (the husband, the sister, the officer, etc.). Whatever we do, we explain it in our reports. We include the reason why the person needs anonymity.

We also pay attention to the donts of anonymity. That is, no attacks, no disguises and no offers. The Ethics Handbooks guidance on anonymous sourcing is collected here. Of particular importance is this guideline: Describe Anonymous Sources As Clearly As You Can Without Identifying Them.

Second, NPR does not show its stories to sources before broadcast or posting. Here is our guidance:

For purposes of accuracy and fairness, there are times when we may want to review portions of a script with a source or read back a quotation to ensure we captured it correctly. We may also play audio or read transcripts of an interview to a third party if the purpose is to get that partys reaction to what another person has said. Otherwise, however, the public is the first audience for our work  we dont preview scripts or stories in advance of their broadcast or posting with sources, subjects of coverage or other parties outside NPR.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

Every time Rod Stewart, Linda Ronstadt, Carly Simon or even Bob Dylan have done a standards album, maybe they should have had to pay a small royalty to Willie Nelson. The co-king of the 1970s outlaw-country movement did about the most outlaw thing he could have done in 1978 by releasing Stardust, a deep dive into the then-uncool Great American Songbook that presaged decades of other rock, country and soul singers also doing their part to break down the Irving Berlin wall. He wasn't the first of his generation to make a recorded case for Hoagy Carmichael, Ringo Starr's little-noticed solo debut, Sentimental Journey, having been an early entry in the genre. But it was the quintuple-platinum Stardust, far more than any other album, that marked an official end to the generation gap.

The last song on Stardust was George and Ira Gershwin's ""Someone To Watch Over Me,"" and 38 years later, he revives that revival on Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin. Probably wisely, Nelson resisted the urge to title his Gershwin tribute album S'Willie  that doesn't quite trip off the tongue the way it should  but this prosaic title fits, too. In Willie's world, the livin' is nothing but easy, and the general mood befits the musical comedies of the 1930s from which most of the songs spring (Porgy And Bess withstanding). While at 74 Dylan is using his excursions into standards (he just started recording another one) to stare down dark, Sinatra-style alleys, the 82-year-old Nelson has never sounded more like he belongs on the sunny side of the street.

This applies even to the straight ballads. You almost have to laugh hearing Nelson re-record ""Someone To Watch Over Me,"" because the last person in the world you'd take for a ""little lamb who's lost in the wood"" would be the romantically independent and usually blithe Nelson. But it's an enormous pleasure to hear him glide through Ira's pleading syllables, even if we don't believe the vulnerability and anguish in the album-opening ""But Not For Me"" for a breezy second.

Nelson does ""put on some speed"" in plenty of the new album's tracks, adopting a style that nearly approaches the light-footedness of Western swing, though there's nary a moment you'd mistake for straight country. ""I Got Rhythm"" opens with riffs being traded between Nelson's eternal harmonica player, Mickey Raphael, and guest steel-guitar legend Paul Franklin  and it's interesting that Nelson makes freer use of steel when he's venturing toward jazz than he does back in the country wheelhouse. Nelson's triumph in his use of rhythm is to make you barely notice any rhythm at all, from the first touch of brushes on a snare in the opening track. ""Jaunty"" and ""effortless"" may sound like damning-with-faint-praise terms, but Nelson's lack of interest in having us see him or his crack ensemble sweat is no reason not to admire the decades of accomplishment that make the singer sound as born to Gershwin champagne soirees as to Toby Keith duets.

A few years ago, as part of his at-least-an-album-a-year output, Nelson released To All The Girls..., a collection of new duets with female singers. He reprises that concept here with a pair of collaborations. First up is Cyndi Lauper  set to make her foray into country this spring  in ""Let's Call The Whole Thing Off."" She uses the pure comedy of Ira's lyrics as a springboard to have even more fun with the (arguable?) mispronunciations, and can't help blurting out, ""I love you, Willie"" over the solo he delivers on his trusty acoustic guitar, Trigger. Nelson doesn't return the vocal idiosyncrasies, so it's unclear if he's having what she's having or has already quietly made the decision to call things off, but his and Lauper's harmonies in the chorus exude truly vintage-sounding sweetness. A more frequent duet partner, Sheryl Crow, plays it straight in ""Embraceable You,"" the perfect aperitif for a Valentine's Day gone particularly well.

If you love the Red-Headed Stranger but Gershwin is, for some reason, not your thing, don't worry  he'll have another album out in about 10 minutes, to add to the 70 or so studio records already in his just-keep-scrolling discography. When he asks, ""Who's got the last laugh now"" (in ""They All Laughed""), it's clearly a trick question: A sense of finality, or even winding down, is not in his vocabulary. If you believed in cosmic balance, you could almost imagine that his having such a prolific career is justice for George ""You Can't Take That Away From Me"" Gershwin having been taken away from us in 1937 at the tragic age of 38. ""Our Love Is Here To Stay""? That's a sentiment you do believe, coming out of the sweet mouth of the most lovable of all immortals.","['album', 'rhythm', 'country', 'straight', 'thing', 'stardust', 'nelson', 'summertime', 'gershwin', 'willie', 'having']"

toggle caption Furnace by Livia Llewellyn Digital Download, 170 | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

In Engines of Desire, Livia Llewellyn's debut collection of short stories from 2011, reality was just another raw material to be stretched and reworked. Llewellyn's follow-up collection, Furnace, is a slightly slimmer volume, but it doesn't skimp when it comes to her distorted vision. Beautiful and hideous in the same breath, its 13 tales of erotic, surreal, existential horror pack a logic-shattering punch.

Llewellyn is steeped in the eerie tradition of H.P. Lovecraft and Thomas Ligotti, and a sympathetic sense of dislocation and dread permeates Furnace. Unnervingly vivid, stories such as ""Allochthon""  whose title is borrowed from a real-life geological phenomenon but sounds like something straight out of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos  are full of the sounds and smells of decay. Set in Washington state during the Great Depression, it's the internal narrative of a housewife named Ruth whose unease about her humdrum life takes on supernatural dimensions as the mountains around her begin to feel mysteriously alive. Strange things happen, over and over, and they're not explained; instead, Llewellyn allows Ruth to slip into a feverish state of perception, caught somewhere between our world and whatever lies just a few degrees beyond.

Heavy on weird concept and grotesque atmosphere, Furnace doesn't dwell much on dialogue or psychological exposition. Llewellyn isn't as interested in fleshing out her characters as she is in their flesh itself. In ""Cinereous,"" which is sort of like the Marquis de Sade wandering into a Francois Truffaut film, gruesome medical experimentation on feral children in 18th century France leads to unspeakable consequences. In elegant language  ""images of each silky shining drop of blood out there in the dark, spurting and squirting from the bright flat mouths of open necks""  Llewellyn sketches depraved acts of violence and inhumanity, dancing back and forth over the line between obscenity and ecstasy. It's dark, but bewitchingly so.

As imaginative as her settings are, Llewellyn works well within the framework of established tropes. ""Wasp & Snake"" is a take on Aesop's fable ""The Wasp and the Snake,"" only reconfigured as a flesh-warping revenge parable with a hellish twist. There's a similar theme of body horror in the lush Gothic story ""Yours Is the Right to Begin,"" a poetically gory romance set between the lines of Bram Stoker's Dracula  an account of what Mina Harker might have fully experienced while hypnotized by Van Helsing.

Lust runs through Furnace like a torrent, but it mingles with numbness and confusion in the book's title story, where a slow-motion apocalypse has an anesthetic effect on a 13-year-old girl and the object of her crush. She lives in a small town paralyzed by uncanny occurrences  including the disappearance of a store full of shoppers and the appearance of the corpse of an impossible bird  and where a weird-eyed boy seems to be at the center of it all. Nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award in 2013, Furnace is a tour de force of haunting imagery and mood, set during Llewellyn's favorite time of year: that fleeting, liminal state between the end of summer and the start of autumn, when colors fade and ripeness turns to ash. Furnace captures that time perfectly, not by trying to nail it down in a sentimental way, but by converting the energy of atrophy and loss into a nightmare of cosmic proportions.

""Spaces are meant to be filled,"" Llewellyn writes in ""Panopticon,"" the book's opener. A bad dream that takes place in a debauched, glittering metropolis called Obsidia, it's not so much a story as it is a catalog of jaw-dropping phantasms, rendered in sumptuous prose; ""Across the iron bridge and over the Mannequin Sea,"" she writes, ""its million slow-eyed beauties jumbled below like broken teeth against a giant's fist."" The girl in the title story has a grandfather who traces all the town's bizarre happenings on a map until the paper is practically saturated with ink. In a way, that's what Llewellyn herself does: fill the spaces of Furnace near to bursting with blood and shadow and dust, with horror and wonder.

Did Myanmar hold its most free elections in decades?

No, as a listener told us, it held its freest elections in decades.

Todays question: When should we use more or most instead of -er or -est to form comparatives and superlatives?

To figure out the answer, it helps to count syllables.

Fowlers Modern English Usage says that adjectives of one or two syllables normally form their comparative and superlative forms by adding er and est. ... Adjectives of more than two syllables are normally preceded by more or most ...

The BBC puts it this way: It is clear that adjectives of one syllable normally end in -er and est in their comparative and superlative forms whilst the comparative and superlative of adjectives with three or more syllables are formed with more and most.

The Chicago Manual of Style agrees. It notes, however, that a few one-syllable adjectives  such as real, right, and wrong  can take only more and most. ... Eager, proper, and somber, unlike many two-syllable adjectives, also take only more and most. It sagely advises consulting a good dictionary. (NPR uses Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition.)

Finally, in 1925 my great uncle Frederick Memmott and fellow educator Nell Young, in the sixth grade edition of their textbooks Good English in Speaking and Writing, told students that nearly all our adjectives containing only one syllable are compared by adding the syllables -er and -est. Some of our adjectives containing two or more syllables are compared by adding -er and -est, but others require the use of the words more and most. All the adjectives containing more than two syllables require the use of more and most in comparing things.

There you go. If the adjective has one or two syllables, you almost always add er and est. When there are three or more syllables, more and most are almost certainly the words to choose. Check the dictionary if youre not sure.

Uncle Frederick died 32 years before I was born. I dont know this for sure, but I trust he would have thanked us for keeping these guidelines in mind.

As part of its investigation, the government obtained a search warrant for Feng's iPhone. But the phone was locked by a password, so prosecutors asked a judge for an order compelling Apple to unlock it.

""In about 70 prior occasions, this exact situation had occurred,"" says Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer, who's now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""And Apple had elected to comply with the court order.""

The fact that Apple had unlocked roughly 70 phones in previous cases was revealed during a court hearing last October.

And Apple might have quietly unlocked Jun Feng's phone, too, but something unusual happened. Federal Magistrate Judge James Orenstein did not sign the order the government wanted. Instead, he went public and asked Apple if the company had any objections.

""What was remarkable was that the public hadn't seen the argument surfaced,"" says Jennifer Granick at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. She says Judge Orenstein was trying to stoke a public debate. ""Judge Orenstein had concerns about whether the government's legal argument was a valid legal argument.""

The judge seemed particularly skeptical that the government relied in part on an 18th-century law called the All Writs Act. Prosecutors say it gives them authority to compel private companies to help carry out search warrants.

The government probably expected Apple to comply, just like the company had dozens of times before, says Hennessey.

""What All Writs is intended to do is that in those areas where Congress has not spoken, it's intended to fill the gap, such that the courts can effectuate their orders,"" Hennessey says. ""This is precisely how All Writs has been applied throughout history.""

But this time, lawyers for Apple disagreed. They said the company had complied when the law seemed settled, but at the hearing in Feng's case in October, Apple's lawyers argued that the government was actually asking for something novel: the power to force a tech company to unlock one of its devices.

It's similar to the argument that's now playing out in California, where the FBI wants Apple to unlock Farook's iPhone.

""The cases are different, but the underlying legal question is very similar,"" says Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The question in the New York case is whether the government can rely on this very old statute to conscript Apple into government service.""

There are some key differences between the two cases. The defendant's iPhone in New York was using an older operating system, iOS 7, which makes it relatively easy for Apple to unlock the phone. The iPhone in California is running Apple's newer operating system, iOS 9, and the company says it would have to create software just to unlock it.

Abdo says that's a conscious choice by Apple.

""They didn't want to be in the position, they told the court, of having to serve as a government investigative agent,"" he says. ""They wanted to be out of the business of spying on their customers.""

That may be especially important to Apple in international markets, where security is a big selling point. But U.S. law enforcement is frustrated by that argument. Federal prosecutors say Apple is putting its own public relations interests ahead of national security.

They think Apple could easily unlock the phones in California and Brooklyn  just like it's done 70 times before.","['doj', 'wanted', 'apple', 'writs', 'company', 'argument', 'brooklyn', 'seeds', 'iphone', 'sown', 'unlock', 'apples', 'judge', 'law', 'public', 'standoff']"

Sometimes silence speaks loudest. That certainly seems to be the case with ""Bed Down"" from Penny & Sparrow's Let a Lover Drown You. Like most of the other songs on the Austin folk-rock duo's third album (and Thirty Tigers debut), ""Bed Down"" is delivered with the most sparse production possible, utilizing only those sonic elements absolutely necessary to get the point across. For the first two minutes, Andy Baxter's butterscotch baritone and Kyle Jahnke's harmony are accompanied by little more than an acoustic guitar and its echoes  and the open (but not empty) spaces in the arrangement allow plenty of room for the song's melancholy mood to subtly, organically grow in intensity.

""One of the many things we learned from our producer [ex-Civil Wars singer John Paul White] was to focus on the actual song first and the arrangement second,"" explains Jahnke. ""Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the production of a song. We liked the idea of using space as a tool, just as you would with rich and full arrangements. Doing so really lets the big moments in the album shine.""

Lyrically, ""Bed Down"" maintains a delicate dance between heartache and resolve. Even as the character at the center of its story seems overcome by sadness, he keeps pushing towards the light at the end of the tunnel. ""This song is about having to remind yourself that you have moved on from an ex-lover,"" says Jahnke. ""Sometimes it's hard to remember that."" Even though Baxter is ostensibly addressing the architect of his heartbreak in the song's second-person perspective, it eventually becomes clear that he's really just talking to himself, laying the whole sad story out in order to motivate himself to let go. It's surely no coincidence that Jahnke's harmony vocals first appear with the key cathartic line ""I know you never gave a damn about me,"" arriving just in time to offer some brotherly solidarity.

The melody of ""Bed Down"" has a dramatic but unconventional flow which edges closer to art-song than pop. And the track's dynamics mirror the ebb and flow of the emotions it stirs up, reaching their peak when Baxter declares himself definitively done with the past, then riding out gently as he and Jahnke join together to quietly but firmly repeat ""no more"" several times at the tune's coda.

P.S. Don't infer from all this emotional intensity that these guys are humorless. When asked how the one-time roommates at University of Texas came up with their sobriquet, Jahnke wryly explains, ""Our other roommate used to write short stories under the alias Penny and Sparrow. After we took his life we took the band name for ourselves. Just kidding, we didn't kill him. Or did we?""

""Raise your hand if you have ever determined your location on the planet using the stars,"" Lt. Daniel Stayton tells his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.

A young officer halfheartedly puts up her hand. Another wavers. The rest of the class of 20 midshipmen sits stone-faced.

This is the challenge facing the U.S. Navy as it tries to bring back celestial navigation. The Navy stopped training its service members to navigate by the stars about a decade ago, focusing instead on electronic navigational systems. But fears about the security of the Global Positioning System, and a desire to return to the basics of naval training are pushing the fleet back toward this ancient method of finding a course across open water.

Navigation by the stars dates back millennia. The ancient Polynesians used stars and constellations to help guide their outrigger canoes across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean. And right up until the mid-20th century, navigation on the sea was usually done by looking at the heavens.

That changed in the late 1970s, when the military began launching GPS satellites. The satellite system provided a far more accurate fix than the stars could. In 2000, the U.S. Navy began phasing out sextants and charts in favor of computers.

Rear Adm. Michael White, who heads the Navy's training, says the change in curriculum was driven by the need to bring young officers up to speed on the Navy's equivalent of Googlemaps, called the Voyage Management System. It uses GPS, radar, and other tools to precisely track a ship's position and course across the ocean. The system is complex and, ""we don't have infinite training time available,"" White says.

i toggle caption Geoff Brumfiel/NPR Geoff Brumfiel/NPR

So, why return now to the old ways? The Navy and other branches of the U.S. military are becoming increasingly concerned, in part, that they may be overly reliant on GPS. ""We use it to synchronize all military operations, we use it to navigate everywhere  it's just something the U.S. military can't live without,"" says Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now with the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that studies security issues in outer space. In a big war, the GPS satellites could be shot down. Or, more likely, their signal could be jammed or hacked.

Already, jamming has become more common, Weeden says. ""You can buy a lot of GPS jammers off the Internet,"" he says. ""A lot of those are made by Russia.""

He thinks the Russians probably have systems to jam the special signals the military uses as well. And China may be developing similar capabilities.

White, who heads the Navy's training, says there is also a desire to get back to basics. Over the past decade, electronic navigation systems on ships have become easier to use, so less training is required. He says the Navy is bringing back celestial navigation to make sure its officers understand the fundamentals.

""You know, I would equate it to blindly following the navigation system in your car: If you don't have an understanding of north/south/east/west, or perhaps where you're going, it takes you to places you didn't intend to go,"" he says.

In fact, there has been at least one incident in the past decade when a Navy ship ran aground partly because of problems with the electronic navigation system, investigators say.

Back in the classroom at the Naval Academy, the midshipmen finishing up their first course seem a little bewildered. Until now, says 20-year-old Audrey Channell, celestial navigation wasn't on her radar.

""I mean, obviously I heard about using stars to navigate in the old days,"" she says, ""but I never thought I'd be using it.""

Like many of the others in the class, she uses GPS to navigate her daily life.

Her instructor, Daniel Stayton, says that's OK. Nobody expects these young officers to become Magellans overnight.","['training', 'using', 'young', 'brings', 'officers', 'system', 'stars', 'navigate', 'navy', 'military', 'navigation', 'gps']"

Nice work by all those involved in todays news from the Navy Yard. We did not fall into the traps that some other media outlets did. We stuck with what was known, we were clear about what was not known, and we stayed away from rumors.

A couple things to keep in mind:

 When passing along information to the lead editor(s) and Newsdesk-Eds@npr.org, please be as specific as you can about the source. For example, if the news is that the all clear has been given, tell us whos saying that. A police lieutenant you just spoke to? The public information officer on the scene? The mayors chief of staff? Knowing that will help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

 When passing along information, be clear about what you feel can be reported and what cannot be reported (but is something you want editors to be aware of). That will also help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

Again, those are points to keep in mind. But the most important thing to take away from today is how well we did when it came to reporting solid information and staying away from thinly sourced rumors. Thanks.

NPR uses Islamist. The dictionary is our guide.

Islamist is a noun meaning an advocate or supporter of Islamism  which in turn is defined as a movement advocating the social and political establishment of Islamic fundamentalism.

Compound nouns such as Islamist fighters or Islamist militants describe who we are reporting about because they make the connection to the fundamentalist movement.

Islamic is too general. Its just the adjective formed from the noun Islam.

SAGAL: I am fine. How are things in Atlanta? We're going down there in just a couple weeks to do our show at the beautiful Fox Theater.

BARNES: Indeed you are.

SAGAL: What's...

BARNES: Unfortunately, you are sold out, and I can't get in. So can you hook me up with some tickets?

MAZ JOBRANI: Nice.

SAGAL: I don't know. Wait a minute, I don't know, David. What can you do for me?

SAGAL: David, you're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is David's topic?

KURTIS: Chipotle - that's Spanish for uh-oh.

SAGAL: So...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Chipotle, everybody's favorite burrito chain, has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. But this weekend, we learned norovirus is not the only unwanted item on their menu. We heard another interesting story about bad news out of Chipotle. Our panelists are each going to tell you one. Only one of those stories, of course, is real. Your job - pick the real one, you'll get Carl Kasell's voice on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?

BARNES: I am indeed.

SAGAL: All right, first let's hear from Mo Rocca.

MO ROCCA: The folks who run Chipotle are exhausted from all the bad press. I mean, they are pooped, sick and turd of it all.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: Unfortunately, here's more - to placate loyal customers when its stores were shut down nationwide for a day to address food safety issues, the chain advertised a special promotion - text of the word raincheck to a six-digit number and get a free burrito. Simple enough, except that due to a glitch, hundreds of messages sent from the D.C. area went not to Chipotle but to Bethesda, Md., resident Hank Levine. When Levine politely replied to texters that he had no burritos to give them, the you-know-what hit the fan, which I'm pretty sure is how Chipotle got in trouble in the first place.

(LAUGHTER)

ROCCA: Quote, ""this isn't fit to print,"" said Levine, ""but one text said essentially get my bleeping burrito you bleeping bleep or I'll bleepity (ph) bleep you. You learn what people are really like when you become a social media mistake. Chipotle compensated Levine generously with coupons for four free meals.

(LAUGHTER, GROANS)

SAGAL: A texting error gets lots of requests for free burritos to Mr. Levine, the Washington, D.C., area. You're next story of someone getting Chipotlaid comes from Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: For the past 22 years, Ted Cooper made his living as Chippy, the dancing burrito mascot of Chipotle's Mexican Grill. Life was good until Cooper was sidelined last fall after adding a bit about the E. coli crisis to his act. At some point during his appearances, he would grab his little burrito stomach, pretend to throw up and, quote, ""vomit confetti and discount coupons.""

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Chipotle execs were not amused and now he's out of a job. Quote, ""Chippy has been dumped because some corporate suits need to look serious,"" Cooper told The Denver Post. Corporate spokeswoman Dawn Tishman said, Chippy will return when they find the right performer to replace Cooper. Quote, ""we're grateful for Ted's service, but we just don't think a vomiting dancing burrito is funny.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: They don't, do they?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I could only but agree, Roxanne. That's not funny at all. So the dancing burrito who advertises Chipotle gets fired for getting too much into the act. Your last story of troubled in Chiparadise (ph) comes from Maz Jobrani.

JOBRANI: Anyone who has eaten a burrito knows they pack a lot of calories. So in an effort to reduce the caloric intake of the menu items found at Chipotle, the corporate brass came up with an innovative idea. They decided to install moving treadmills in place of the floor where people stood in line to give their orders. This would force people to keep walking while waiting in line, thus burning upwards of a hundred calories just while the ordered. Brilliant, right? It seemed that way until customers started falling. German tourist Wolfgang von Grimmelshausen...

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: ...Who ate at the restaurant was quoted as saying (imitating German accent) ""when I first walked in...

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: ""...I thought this is a great idea. I'm a fit 75-year-old who goes for walks every morning in Bavaria. I figured even a baby could handle the treadmill at the burrito shop. But right when I got my chicken burrito with sour cream, someone turned up the treadmill. That's not fair. My supreme Burrito went flying...

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: ...Hit the face of the lady behind me. She fell on the man behind her, who then fell on a baby.""

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: She promptly offered to give them free food for a month while they rested and avoided physical activity.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: So in the end, these customers gained more weight than if the treadmills had never been installed in the first place.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: Von Grimmelshausen was quoted as saying (imitating German accent) ""I am now 20 pounds heavier than when I first walked into Chipotle. I used to look like a manly man. Now I look like a big, fat burrito.

(LAUGHTER)

JOBRANI: ""Thank God the baby is OK.""

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right, David, back to you. These are your choices - they were from Mo - how an attempt by Chipotle to make up for their - well, sickness-spreading food led to an overwhelming number of angry text messages to an innocent person, from Roxanne Roberts - how the dancing burrito mascot lost his job by trying to work in the whole health crisis into his act or from Maz Jobrani - how an upstanding German person was no longer upstanding when he was knocked to the floor by Chipotle's ill-thought-out treadmill waiting area. Which of these is the real story of more bad news from Chipotle?

BARNES: Well, you know, I've seen the standing treadmills in the Minneapolis airport. It makes me wonder. But I'm going to have to go with the lost text messages.

SAGAL: The lost text messages - the text messages flooding into the innocent non-Chipotle store person. All right, well, we spoke to somebody very close to this real story to tell you about it.

HANK LEVINE: He's just been getting all of these text messages by people saying, I want my burrito. And now he's just trying to get the people the burritos he feels they rightly deserve.

SAGAL: That was Dorry Levine. She is the daughter-in-law of Hank Levine, the guy who got all those texts. Congratulations David, you got it right. You've earned a point for Mo simply for telling the truth.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And Carl Kasell, our old friend, always spicy (ph) - will record the greeting on your voicemail. Congratulations.

BARNES: Thank you, sir.

i toggle caption Ulf Andersen/Getty Images Ulf Andersen/Getty Images

Internationally acclaimed Italian author and philosopher Umberto Eco has died at age 84. His death was confirmed by his American publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

Born in a small Italian town in 1932, Eco is perhaps best known for his 1980 mystery novel The Name of the Rose, which is set in a monastery in the 14th century. It was an unexpected international bestseller, launching his career as an author.

Eco didn't publish his first novel until he was 48, when a friend suggested he write a detective story. Before that, his focus was medieval studies and semiotics. And even after he published novels, he said ""I am a philosopher ... I write novels only on the weekends,"" the BBC reported.

Here's how Eco described his transition into fiction in an interview with The Paris Review:

""I have long thought that what most philosophical books are really doing at the core is telling the story of their research, just as scientists will explain how they came to make their major discoveries. So I feel that I was telling stories all along, just in a slightly different style.""

He told NPR's Scott Simon last October that several of his novels like Foucault's Pendulum and Numero Zero focused on characters that he affectionately termed ""losers""  because ""they are more interesting than the winners.""

""They have a more complicated philosophy,"" Eco told Scott. ""And then in the world, there are more losers than winners, and so my readers can identify themselves with the characters.""

Eco's works tend to be challenging and laden with obscure references. But as he told The New York Times, he considered ""challenging"" a compliment: ""Only publishers and television people believe that people crave easy experiences.""

According to the Times, he had already decided in 1995 ""what he wants carved on his tombstone. In a book by the Renaissance philosopher Tommaso Campanella, a character says, 'Wait, wait,' and another man responds, 'I cannot.'

 Safe haven.

 Final results.

 Advance planning.

You can probably think of many more.

There are times when pleonasms are useful  for instance, when you want to make sure listeners really, really, really understand the point youre making. Also, they are common expressions and we do try to be conversational.

But, they annoy some listeners, might add nothing to your story and take up space when you may be fighting to squeeze in valuable information. Feel free to cut them.

i toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Apple shareholders will be voting on a proposal at the annual meeting Feb. 26. It's a proposal that the company opposes, which calls for the tech leader to increase diversity in its senior management.

Antonio Maldonado owns more than $2,000 worth of stock in Apple and he's been pushing the company to increase what he calls an ""abysmal"" lack of diversity at the top level. In 2015, the company had one Hispanic and four African-American members among the 103 people Apple considers executives, senior officials and managers. Seventy-three of those top executives were white men.

""They believe that they're making a lot of progress and that their numbers are great in upper management. And [my belief] is actually quite the opposite,"" Maldonado told NPR's Michel Martin.

He says he first became interested in this issue while discussing tech careers with his son. ""We were reviewing the website for Apple. And he just made a quick quirp and just said 'Oh look at that, I'll be the first person of color up there.'

""That stuck in my mind, believe it or not,"" he says. ""And for three years I did some research and I started challenging Apple directly about this. And unfortunately, they never gave me sufficient answers as to why it was occurring, so I decided to come up with this.""

Maldonado's shareholder proposal requests ""that the board of directors adopt an accelerated recruitment policy,"" which would require Apple ""to increase the diversity of senior management and its Board of Directors, two bodies that presently fails to adequately represent diversity (particularly Hispanic, African-American, Native-American and other people of colour).""

Apple's board opposes the proposal. The company argues it ""is unduly burdensome and not necessary because Apple has demonstrated to shareholders its commitment to inclusion and diversity, which are core values for our company."" Company lawyers also said the proposal would ""micro-manage"" hiring decisions and that it was impossible to implement because it would ""require the candidates the Company recruits"" to accept job offers.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote that the company was ""committed to fostering and advancing inclusion and diversity across Apple and all the communities we're a part of."" At other levels besides the top suite, Apple's diversity improved slightly in 2015.

As part of diversity efforts, the company points to its move to provide scholarships to historically black colleges, donations of Apple products to schools as part of President Obama's ConnectED initiative, and sponsoring the 2015 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

At the top level, five of Apple's eight board members are white men. James A. Bell, the former president of Boeing who is African-American, was elected to the board in October 2015. Almost all of the 18 executives listed on Apple's website are white men. Two executives are African-American women.

""Unfortunately when they start pointing to something like that, it tends to be tokenism,"" Maldonado says of the two black executives. ""Let's just look at the facts. For instance, in the board of directors, it was a span of 18 years between having black members within the board of directors.""

Maldonado says the recent additions of women and African-Americans to the board and group of senior executives was the result of pressure from groups like the Rainbow PUSH coalition of Jesse Jackson. Jackson told Bloomberg last year that it's a small sign that ""Apple is moving in the right direction.""

But ""the company lags far behind Facebook, Google and Microsoft"" among diversity in senior management, according to Engadget.

Issues of diversity at Apple are reflective of the technology industry as a whole, which is dominated by white men. Activists have prodded tech firms to begin issuing regular diversity reports on their progress.

Maldonado's proposal is nonbinding. But ""it does nudge a company to actually act rightly. It's a black mark on their brand if they decide to go against something that the shareholders want,"" he says. ""After all, the company's owned by shareholders, not by individuals. So therefore they have to comply eventually to shareholders' requests. Even though it may not be today or tomorrow, eventually they have to.""

i toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Harper Lee, the author of the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, has died in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer was 89.

Monroeville city officials confirmed reports of Lee's death to Alabama Public Radio. Her publisher, HarperCollins, also confirmed the news to NPR.

Her famous novel about a young girl's experience of racial tensions in a small Southern town has sold tens of millions of copies and been translated into dozens of languages.

Lee's family issued a statement Friday morning saying that Lee ""passed away in her sleep early this morning. Her passing was unexpected. She remained in good basic health until her passing.""

Family spokesman Hank Conner, Lee's nephew, said:

""This is a sad day for our family. America and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century's most beloved authors. We knew her as Nelle Harper Lee, a loving member of our family, a devoted friend to the many good people who touched her life, and a generous soul in our community and our state. We will miss her dearly.""

The family says that as Lee had requested, a private funeral service will be held.

Lee made headlines last year, on the news that a companion to her beloved novel would be coming out some 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird was first published in 1960. When that book, Go Set a Watchman, was published last summer, it set off debates about the author's health and how involved she had been in the project.

An Alabama native, Lee moved to New York City in 1948 with the dream of being a writer. For about eight years, she worked as an airline reservationist at Eastern Airlines.

As NPR reported last summer:

""Lee's fortunes began to improve at the end of 1956 when her friends Michael and Joy Williams Brown gave Nelle, as those close to Lee call her, a generous Christmas gift: enough money to spend a year writing. That's when she completed the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman. The novel helped her find an agent, who got her signed to the publisher J.B. Lippincott. But Go Set a Watchman was never released. Instead, Lee's editor urged her to expand on the flashback passages set during Scout's childhood. Lee spent more than two years writing and rewriting the novel that became known as To Kill a Mockingbird.""

When it was published in 1960, To Kill a Mockingbird found immediate success. Lee won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction the following year, and the novel inspired a film adaptation that came out in 1962 starring Mary Badham as Scout and Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.

That film was also a smashing success, garnering numerous Academy Award nominations and several wins.

Lee was famous for avoiding the public eye  one of the last extensive interviews she gave took place in 1964, when she spoke to New York radio station WQXR. Here's some of what she said:

""Well, my objectives are very limited. I think I want to do the best I can with the talent that God gave me, I suppose. I would like to be the chronicler of something that I think is going down the drain very swiftly, and that is small-town, middle-class Southern life. There is something universal in it. Something decent to be said for it, and something to lament, once it goes, in its passing. In other words, all I want to be is the Jane Austen of South Alabama.""

In that same conversation, Lee also spoke of how she had attended law school, but ""I didn't graduate. I left the university one semester before I'd have gotten my degree.""

In 2007, Lee was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she was honored with a National Medal of Arts in 2010.

Here's how news website AL.com describes Lee's final years:

""Harper Lee suffered a stroke in 2007, recovered and resumed her life in the hometown where she spent many of her 89 years. A guardedly private individual, Lee was respected and protected by residents of the town that displays Mockingbird-themed murals and each year stages theatrical productions of To Kill a Mockingbird. ""Lee returned to Monroeville for good once her sister Alice became ill and needed help. She'd eat breakfast each morning at the same fast-food place, and could later be seen picking up Alice from the law firm founded by their father.""

President and Mrs. Obama released this statement Friday in memory of Lee:","['set', 'lee', 'family', 'author', 'harper', 'dies', 'morning', 'winning', 'lees', 'novel', 'mockingbird', 'published', 'pulitzerprize', 'kill', 'watchman', 'twoway', 'npr']"

npr,,Guidance On The Use Of Disturbing Videos And Audio,[],"Guidance On The Use Of Disturbing Videos And Audio

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

 Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

Adolescence is a time when ""friendship feels like something you die for,"" says Irish author Belinda McKeon. It's how she explains the characters in her new novel ""Tender"" to NPR's Rachel Martin.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Catherine Reilly and James Flynn are best friends. They meet in Dublin while Catherine is at college. She's an experienced student at Trinity College who has never had a romance. James is a charismatic and charming artist, gay in the late '90s, when it was difficult to be gay in Ireland. They connect with a force and intensity that makes their friendship special - so special, it feels life-sustaining. But it is also all-consuming and ultimately disastrous. The Irish writer Belinda McKeon's new book is about friendship, desire and the mistakes we make when we're young. The book is called ""Tender."" And she told us that she wrote Catherine and James' relationship as highly intense from the very beginning.

BELINDA MCKEON: But it's also that period of our lives - you know, they're 18 and 19 years old. So it's that time in life when friendship feels like something you'd die for. You meet with a person, and the connection is so incredible, and it's so deep. And you just can't get enough of them. You need - you know, you're looking forward to the next day and the next conversation. You don't want to go to sleep at night. You'll sit up all night talking. And so this is her first experience of a friendship like that. And it is all-consuming for her. So yeah, she's already I suppose confused by the nature or by the intensity of that attachment. But she's also quite a naive and - as I say, she's 19 years old. And she's from a rural background. This is her first year in the city. I wanted to write a very - a character who was very naive and who was blind to what was going on in her own emotional territory. And James becomes - really becomes a pretty severe test case for that.

MARTIN: When James comes out to Catherine as a gay man, it is not a shock to readers. But it is for Catherine. And she does not handle the moment well and behaves rather badly. Yet, you write that scene with a lot of compassion. How did you think of this character? Did - do you like her?

MCKEON: (Laughter) I - I have very mixed feelings. I have a complicated relationship with her I suppose. I mean, there's a lot of me in her. You know, there's a lot of my own self in Catherine, in her deep self-consciousness and her second-guessing of herself and that constant - almost as though there are three layers of inner monologue going on inside her head at all times. So she makes stupid mistakes. She says all the wrong things. And she's very self-regarding and quite self-absorbed. So I wouldn't say that I'm crazy about her. But I also do feel - I do understand her very deeply, I think. I mean, I created her, so I should. In that moment when James comes out, she actually is worried that he's going to ask her to marry him. That's how far away from having a clear view of reality she is. And that whole scene, I just wanted it to be so cringe-inducing. And my skin was crawling as I wrote it.

MARTIN: Yeah, I know - me too.

MCKEON: I needed readers' skin to do the same thing as they read it.

MARTIN: You say that there's a lot of you in Catherine. You also grew up where Catherine did. You went to Trinity. Does it extend further? Did you have a friendship like this, that was that intense?

MCKEON: I had a really intense friendship - and have, continue to have, thankfully, a very close friendship which inspired this book - its younger form, I would say, inspired this book. Its older form is much healthier and less dramatic. It was the late '90s. And like James, he was finding it - and I won't - I shouldn't speak for him. I won't say very much about his actual personal experience. But it was a difficult time to be gay in Ireland. And I think I wanted so much to be such a great friend to him. But I just ended up making things 10 times more difficult.

MARTIN: May I ask if you had romantic feelings for him?

MCKEON: Oh, we had more than romantic feelings. We were essentially having an affair.

MARTIN: Ah.

MCKEON: Yeah, never a dull moment.

MARTIN: Complicated.

MCKEON: (Laughter).

MARTIN: Do you think of this as a love story?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, it's a love story. Yeah, but you know, love has all sorts of motives. It comes from all sorts of needs. And it comes also from all sorts of cultural inheritances and hang-ups. So I think it is a love story but only because my understanding of what love is not just about happiness and togetherness. But it's just as much about the deeper psychological play that goes on.

MARTIN: Do you think how different this story would be if it were placed today? I mean, things are so different in Ireland now, the U.K. The resounding vote in favor of gay marriage passed in Ireland just recently.

MCKEON: Yeah, last May it was a tremendous day. I was there for that vote. It was an extraordinary, extraordinary day to stand in Dublin Castle and watch the votes coming in from each county. It was just - I can't describe how moving it was. But you know, the months coming up to that vote were really, really distressing because although the vote was carried by a large majority, there was a very vocal minority who were, you know, conservative lobby groups who were - got a lot of air time, basically. And so there was a lot of commentary which was deeply hurtful to LGBT people in Ireland, and especially to young LGBT people, talking about how they didn't deserve or shouldn't have this right. It wasn't a right and it wasn't something that should be extended. So I do think that if ""Tender"" was set now it would be - it would be different in many ways. But I have to say, I received a lot of correspondence from young LGBT people after the book was published, some of them not much younger than me and some a lot younger. And it did shock me how they talked about how they could deeply, deeply relate to what the characters had gone through and were going through.

MARTIN: Still, today.

MCKEON: Yeah, and that - you know, that really - that surprised me.

MARTIN: Has your friend read the book?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, he has.

MARTIN: Yeah, he liked it.

MCKEON: He liked it. But, you know, I should say, the novel is - it is a novel. I mean, it took a - it took an autobiographical experience as its source, but it is almost entirely fiction.

MARTIN: Yeah.

MCKEON: And I'm not being coy by saying that because I did think, when I started writing it, that it - that writing autobiography might be the way to write this novel. That turned out not to be the case at all. You take the bones of what happened or you take the feelings, almost the phenomenological feeling of what happened. And you have to - you still have to write a novel. It's still the same work of building a story, building an arch, giving it a shape because life doesn't have a shape. So all of the things I thought would be useful at the beginning - the journals, the diaries, the letters and all those things I have - they turned out to be just distractions on the way to actually making the story. But yeah, he's been supportive of course. He's - you know, he's a wonderful person.

MARTIN: The book is called ""Tender."" It's written by Belinda McKeon. She joined us from our studios in New York. Belinda, thanks so much.

MCKEON: You're very welcome.

Read the intro essay for this package, ""Fresh On The Screen: How TV Is Redefining Whom We Think Of As 'American.'""

Today, we hear from Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi. Come back later this week for stories from Fresh Off the Boat showrunner Nahnatchka Khan, comedian and star of HBO's Insecure Yvonne Orji and Grey's Anatomy star Sara Ramirez. This special package is made possible by the Vilcek Foundation.

Born Aasif Hakim Mandviwala in Mumbai, India, Aasif Mandvi broke through as one of the standouts of the Jon Stewart era of The Daily Show, specializing in lampooning xenophobia, immigrant-bashing and anti-Muslim attitudes as the show's ""Chief Brown Correspondent.""

He's an immigrant twice over: His family emigrated first from India to Bradford, England, when Mandvi was just a year old, and then to Tampa, Fla., when Mandvi was a teen  according to Mandvi, because his father visited the city and fell in love with the concept of brunch: ""There's so much food here in America that they had to invent a fourth meal to eat it all!""

Most recently, Mandvi published a memoir, No Land's Man (now available in paperback) and appeared in the HBO comedy series The Brink. He also developed Halal in the Family for the online video site Funny Or Die  a webseries that explodes Islamophobic attitudes by depicting the over-the-top escapades of prime-time's first-ever Muslim-American sitcom family.","['week', 'aasif', 'star', 'family', 'tv', 'screen', 'islamophobia', 'immigration', 'daily', 'video', 'vilcek', 'talks', 'comedy', 'mandvi']"

CORNISH: Yikes.

SHAPIRO: The image on it is a fantasy forest with every imaginable animal. It's called ""Wilderness.""

CORNISH: ""Wilderness"" is the creation of Adrian Chesterton (sic). He's an artist living in Spain. He says he's done lots of other puzzles.

CHESTERMAN: But I've never done one this big. They're usually about a thousand-piece, 1,500 pieces. But (laughter) obviously, 33,600 is kind of an exception.

CORNISH: Chesterton (sic) says this enormous jigsaw puzzle is just the latest volley in an ever-escalating battle.

CHESTERMAN: There's a company in Germany called Ravensburger, and the company I did this for is Spanish, called Educa Borras. And Educa Borras and Ravensburger have been competing to who has the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world for the last 10 years. So one produced one of at 8,000, and then the other produced one at 10 and then at 12. And it leapt to 16, and then it went to 18 and then 24. This is like a game of tennis. And the last one was Ravensburger - did a 25,000-pieces puzzle.

SHAPIRO: Adrian Chesterton (sic) would like his town to sponsor an event for charity and get schoolchildren to complete this monstrous puzzle. And then he wants the competition to make an ever-bigger puzzle to end.

CHESTERMAN: I mean. it's getting so silly. You'd need a house the size - I mean, you'd have to be the queen of England or - I don't know - live in a house the size of the White House.

CORNISH: That's Adrian Chesterton (sic). His artwork is featured on the world's largest jigsaw puzzle. It's called ""Wilderness."" And by the way, he hasn't assembled it himself because he's too busy. He told us the most recent jigsaw puzzle he solved had just 12 pieces.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Clarkson Potter Courtesy of Clarkson Potter

Korean food is built on bold flavors: spicy pickled vegetables, sweet, smoky meats and pungent, salty stews. That can be a little intimidating for some American diners. But the authors of a new book called Koreatown hope to change that.

Deuki Hong and Matt Rodbard spent two years eating in Koreatowns, from Los Angeles to Atlanta to New York. Restaurants like Cho Dang Gol, a little place in Manhattan that's known for its stews and house-made tofu, where we met for lunch. Rodbard ordered a bowl of kalbijjim  a short-rib stew that's savory and sweet with a fiery kick. Hong says it's a perfect example of Koreans cooking for Koreans.

""When we build restaurants, it's for us. Because we miss home flavors, we miss the motherland,"" says Hong. ""It's not like, 'Hey, let's invite this critic in here, or this person.' It's not like we don't care about you guys. It's just not our focus. And, yeah, we don't really care.""

That's great if you want Korean-Americans to eat at your restaurant. But it's not so good if you're trying to pull in large numbers of non-Korean diners, too.

i toggle caption Sam Horine/Courtesy of Clarkson Potter Sam Horine/Courtesy of Clarkson Potter

""It's really a 'for us, by us' mentality at a lot of restaurants,"" says Rodbard. ""You walk in, English is very limited, sometimes nonexistent. The cuisine just has not caught up with Thai or Japanese or even regional Chinese"" in terms of popularity.

This is where Rodbard and Hong think their book can help. Rodbard is a food writer in Brooklyn. Hong is a 26-year-old Korean-American chef who's worked in the kitchen at two acclaimed New York City restaurants, Momofuku and Jean-Georges. Now he runs his own well-regarded restaurant, Kang Ho Dong Baekjong, in New York's Koreatown.

But Koreatown is no mere celebrity cookbook. Along with recipes, it features interviews, essays and original photos from Korean restaurants across the country. From the biggest Koreatown, in Los Angeles  said by some to have better Korean food than Seoul  to America's fastest-growing K-town, in Atlanta, to its most dense and competitive, on 32nd Street in Manhattan, where, as Hong puts it, ""you'll see a [Korean] barbecue restaurant, right next to a barbecue restaurant, right across from a barbecue restaurant.""

Their cookbook does cover Korean barbecue, and other staples like kimchi and bibimbap. But Rodbard and Hong intentionally focused more on soups and stews, which they call the heart of Korean cooking  dishes like seoulleongtang, a beef bone broth that simmers for hours.

""It's super milky, creamy, and you get some of that oxtail,"" says Hong. ""That's, like, what Koreans eat. It's not like a pretty, fancy or flashy dish that you introduce to your American friends.""

i toggle caption Sam Horine/Courtesy of Clarkson Potter Sam Horine/Courtesy of Clarkson Potter

Hong and Rodbard tested recipes for seoulleongtang and dozens of other dishes at Hong's walk-up apartment in Manhattan. They demonstrate one of those recipes: doenjang jigae, a stew with brisket and clams. The key ingredient is a fermented bean paste that's like a funkier cousin of Japanese miso. Exactly how much you add is a matter of personal taste. As Rodbard explains, there's a concept in Korean cooking called son mat  literally ""taste by hand.""

""It's using your hands, and using your taste to cook with,"" Rodbard says. ""So it's difficult to sometimes put a number on a lot of this cooking.""

That made it hard when it came time to write down fixed amounts of ingredients for the recipes in the cookbook. In the end, Hong says, they were steered by their taste buds.

""We were always about what's so special about this dish. It's that texture, it's that flavor,"" Hong says. The result may not be the most traditional cookbook. But it might help you find your new favorite spot in Koreatown.","['buds', 'rodbard', 'hong', 'clarkson', 'sam', 'koreatown', 'taste', 'welcome', 'thats', 'american', 'tempt', 'korean', 'cookbook', 'restaurants']"

We have some news from the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has won the Nevada Democratic caucuses, the Associated Press projects. We wanted to go to Las Vegas now where NPR's Tamara Keith is standing by at a Clinton rally at Caesar's Palace. Welcome back, Tamara. Have we heard yet from Hillary Clinton?

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi there. No, Hillary Clinton has not spoken yet, but she should be coming pretty soon. And obviously, folks here are pretty thrilled with the outcome. This is the first time that Hillary Clinton can walk out and actually declare victory. In Iowa, she said she had breathed a breath of relief, but the results were way too close to call when she came out. And obviously in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders won by more than 20 points. So this is the first time Hillary Clinton will come on stage and say thanks, I won.

MARTIN: Is that the main significance of this victory, that this is the first kind of clear-cut victory for her?

KEITH: I think the other major significance is the diversity of the electorate here in Nevada. In 2008, it was 65 percent white and 35 percent nonwhite. It's expected that that number will shift, that the population has gotten even more diverse here in Nevada in those intervening years. And her ability to connect with African-American voters and Latino voters is significant because they are the future of the Democratic Party. And those voters are going to be important in winning in the general election. Also, this is significant because Bernie Sanders had so much momentum coming into this. And it's still a close race in Nevada. She didn't win in a landslide. But it does give her the ability to say that she's, you know, stopping some of that Sanders' momentum - Bernmentum (ph) if you will.

MARTIN: I wanted to ask you about that because the reporting in the last couple of days leading up to today was that the race was tougher than expected, that the race was narrower than expected. Could you just talk a little bit about that? Like, what was the feel from each side in the days before, you know, running up to this moment?

KEITH: Absolutely. I mean, and it was tougher than expected and closer than expected. A couple of months ago, her staff was expecting her to win by double digits. And that's not what the result was here tonight. It was closer than that. And so I think that for her staff, you know, Bernie Sanders was there in the rearview mirror and getting closer. And so her staff was sort of downplaying expectations. I think that they had gotten expectations very high ahead of Iowa, and then it was extremely close and it wasn't the kind of win they were hoping for. So this time they were downplaying yesterday. I ran into her campaign manager on the Las Vegas Strip this morning while I was literally out on a run and talked to him. And he said he thought it was going be close, but he said I'd rather be us than them right now, which now we know why he said that.

MARTIN: You think they had a sense that the momentum had shifted, you know, for whatever reason? Tam, before we let you go, former Secretary of State Clinton is not sticking around in Nevada. She's about to fly to Texas. Why there?

KEITH: Well, Texas is a Super Tuesday state. There are just a ton of states that are going to be voting on March 1. And that's another state with a significant minority population on the Democratic side - a lot of African-American voters and Latino voters - and a lot of delegates. And Hillary Clinton wants to try to do well there. Bernie Sanders actually had staff on the ground in Texas earlier than she did. And so that's, you know, an area she hopes to win and so she's going to work for it.

MARTIN: All right, that's NPR's Tamara Keith, covering the campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who just won the Nevada Democratic caucuses as projected by the Associated Press. Tamara, thanks so much for joining us.

KEITH: You're welcome.

Ra Ra Riot has been making music together for over a decade, and has just released its fourth album, Need Your Light. Fans of the band know that it incorporates string instruments with traditional rock ones  but in the early years, that fact threw some people.

""People probably expected a rock-y, party band to just be bass, drums, guitar and vocals,"" says singer Wes Miles. ""They'd say 'What is that?' and we'd say, 'Oh it's a cello.' And, 'It's a violin.'""

The group got its start playing house parties in college. Miles says that's where he and his bandmates developed their exuberant sound, competing with the hum of young people having a good time.

""The house party vibe is not really a place to get emotional and quiet,"" says Miles. ""So basically, when we started, we had to make sure the attention was always coming toward us  you know, being loud and a little crazy.""

Ra Ra Riot decided to make a go of it after college  and having ""indie rock with strings"" as an angle helped it stand out. But a lot can change in the course of a decade.

After two albums, the members decided the description was confining. They started experimenting with a little less strings, and a little more synth. They said goodbye to their longtime cellist, and took some time off. But the core group is grateful for the way it's been able to evolve together.

""It's a sibling sort of relationship,"" Miles says. ""And all the flaws and all the insecurities, we've gotten really good about navigating around them. You know, you just have to accept people how they are and love them for what they do for you.""","['little', 'riot', 'indie', 'started', 'say', 'miles', 'know', 'rock', 'really', 'strings', 'ra']"

Politicians, public officials and  yes  members of the press will say things that dont check out.

 Brian Williams helicopter was not shot down.

 Hillary Clinton did not have to run to her car because of sniper fire at an airport in Bosnia.

 Toronto Mayor Rob Ford ... pick your story.

When we can say some something definitive about such accounts, we should.

The latest case: Donald Trumps statement that he watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.

Regarding that account of what he says happened in New Jersey, we have told our audiences that:

 Police say it didnt happen.

 Local officials in New Jersey continue to dismiss Trumps claims.

 New Jersey officials say it didnt happen.

Those lines add helpful context, but they also create a he said, she said situation. Trump says one thing, police and local officials say another. Have we done all we can to help listeners and Web users figure out whos right?

In situations such as this, we should first ask whether we should repeat the claim. After all, repeating it might give it more life. But if the answer to that question is yes, we should get to the point and say what weve found. Heres how The Two-Way has done it:

We asked our library to look through contemporaneous news reports. They tell us that that they could not turn up any news accounts of American Muslims cheering or celebrating in the wake of Sept. 11.

Another way to say that might be: NPR has searched for credible news accounts about large groups of American Muslims celebrating during or after the Sept. 11 attacks. No such accounts have been found.

We could also flatly report that no evidence has been found in police or credible media accounts from the time to indicate there were large numbers of Muslim-Americans in New Jersey celebrating. We have used the no evidence framing on the air.

Regarding The Washington Post report from Sept. 18, 2001, that Trump has cited, it stated that in Jersey City, within hours of two jetliners plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river. But as we said on Morning Edition this week, there is no reference in the [Washington Post] article to Trumps claim of seeing thousands and thousands Muslims celebrating in Jersey City.

FactCheck.org has noted that:

The Post story said that Jersey City police detained a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding a tailgate-style party in Jersey City. That allegation was unattributed and unverified. Even if it did happen, and there is no evidence of it, the celebrating was not on TV and did not involve thousands and thousands of people.

npr,,Do Listen To This: A Walk Through Sandtown That Is Compelling And Instructive,[],"Do Listen To This: A Walk Through Sandtown That Is Compelling And Instructive

Nurith Aizenmans piece today on Morning Edition is highly recommended listening.

Travon Addison, an athletic 25-year-old with short cropped hair, a wispy beard and tattoos all over his arms, takes her through the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore. I wont spoil it by giving away what listeners learned from Addison. You should definitely keep listening to the end. Addison is a compelling character. Nurith and her editors tell his story well.

There are two other things worth noting:

 We use Addisons full name. That isnt a minor detail. It helps the piece enormously. In stories in which key characters are not fully identified, we have to explain why. That takes time and can lead listeners to wonder what else that person might be hiding.

Nurith didnt do what reporters at some news outlets do too often. She didnt start with the presumption that Addison would want to use just his first name or perhaps even remain anonymous (because he had been arrested earlier in the week). She assumed he would be fully IDd.

That is NPRs standard. As we have discussed before, we name names and do our due diligence. Whats more, whether to go with first-name-only needs to be discussed and explained.

Nurith says another person she met in Baltimore  a white woman who was marching with protesters  initially wanted only her first name to be used in any story. The woman said she didnt want to call attention to herself. Heres how Nurith convinced the woman to give her full name: by pointing out that doing otherwise could have just called more attention to her and raised questions about why she wanted to cloak her identity.

 We seize the moment. As she headed to Baltimore, Nurith ran through in her mind the sorts of stories she wanted to tell and the voices who could be part of those pieces. Those characters included people who live in Sandtown and could talk about what happened last week and in recent decades.

Nurith heard Addison complaining about how he and others werent being heard from and how outsiders dont know anything about his neighborhood and why there were riots. So she asked him to show me your Baltimore.

It was a simple request that produced an excellent story.

i toggle caption Amanda Gray/U.S. Navy Amanda Gray/U.S. Navy

""Raise your hand if you have ever determined your location on the planet using the stars,"" Lt. Daniel Stayton tells his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.

A young officer halfheartedly puts up her hand. Another wavers. The rest of the class of 20 midshipmen sits stone-faced.

This is the challenge facing the U.S. Navy as it tries to bring back celestial navigation. The Navy stopped training its service members to navigate by the stars about a decade ago, focusing instead on electronic navigational systems. But fears about the security of the Global Positioning System, and a desire to return to the basics of naval training are pushing the fleet back toward this ancient method of finding a course across open water.

Navigation by the stars dates back millennia. The ancient Polynesians used stars and constellations to help guide their outrigger canoes across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean. And right up until the mid-20th century, navigation on the sea was usually done by looking at the heavens.

That changed in the late 1970s, when the military began launching GPS satellites. The satellite system provided a far more accurate fix than the stars could. In 2000, the U.S. Navy began phasing out sextants and charts in favor of computers.

Rear Adm. Michael White, who heads the Navy's training, says the change in curriculum was driven by the need to bring young officers up to speed on the Navy's equivalent of Googlemaps, called the Voyage Management System. It uses GPS, radar, and other tools to precisely track a ship's position and course across the ocean. The system is complex and, ""we don't have infinite training time available,"" White says.

i toggle caption Geoff Brumfiel/NPR Geoff Brumfiel/NPR

So, why return now to the old ways? The Navy and other branches of the U.S. military are becoming increasingly concerned, in part, that they may be overly reliant on GPS. ""We use it to synchronize all military operations, we use it to navigate everywhere  it's just something the U.S. military can't live without,"" says Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now with the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that studies security issues in outer space. In a big war, the GPS satellites could be shot down. Or, more likely, their signal could be jammed or hacked.

Already, jamming has become more common, Weeden says. ""You can buy a lot of GPS jammers off the Internet,"" he says. ""A lot of those are made by Russia.""

He thinks the Russians probably have systems to jam the special signals the military uses as well. And China may be developing similar capabilities.

White, who heads the Navy's training, says there is also a desire to get back to basics. Over the past decade, electronic navigation systems on ships have become easier to use, so less training is required. He says the Navy is bringing back celestial navigation to make sure its officers understand the fundamentals.

""You know, I would equate it to blindly following the navigation system in your car: If you don't have an understanding of north/south/east/west, or perhaps where you're going, it takes you to places you didn't intend to go,"" he says.

In fact, there has been at least one incident in the past decade when a Navy ship ran aground partly because of problems with the electronic navigation system, investigators say.

Back in the classroom at the Naval Academy, the midshipmen finishing up their first course seem a little bewildered. Until now, says 20-year-old Audrey Channell, celestial navigation wasn't on her radar.

""I mean, obviously I heard about using stars to navigate in the old days,"" she says, ""but I never thought I'd be using it.""

Like many of the others in the class, she uses GPS to navigate her daily life.

Her instructor, Daniel Stayton, says that's OK. Nobody expects these young officers to become Magellans overnight.","['training', 'using', 'young', 'brings', 'officers', 'system', 'stars', 'navigate', 'navy', 'military', 'navigation', 'gps']"

Morgane Stapleton is not a secret. In Nashville, the long-haired woman who's stood strong as a slender birch beside her husband, Chris, in breakthrough performances at the CMA Awards and on Saturday Night Life is known for being more than just a pristine harmonizer. She's a songwriter who's collaborated with Guy Clark and written a number one hit for Carrie Underwood; she's also a vocalist in her own right, once dubbed the best pure country singer in town. Since joining her husband  the two met on Music Row  she's opted to be his most visible (and audible) support system, singing through his breakthrough album Traveller, acting as his filter for song selections and business moves, and always occupying that space onstage, where she can look into his eyes and render their performance solid. Many times, I've heard Nashvillians sigh, ""I wish Morgane would record that solo album""  yet working with Chris, she fully engages artistically, embodying an ideal of musical, marital partnership.

The version of the old-timey chestnut ""You Are My Sunshine"" Morgane and Chris recorded for producer Dave Cobb's much-anticipated Southern Family concept compilation offers a deep gaze into marriage, winding sentimental attachment together with deep fear of loss. The couple turns this often-recorded sad-happy song as a blues, with blistering guitar and harmonies that scorch the fields. When Morgane claims the final verse, the one not often sung when ""Sunshine"" serves as a children's rhyme, the threat it contains becomes existential. ""If you leave me to love another, you'll regret it all one day."" Her rich, raw alto grips into the phrase until it becomes not possessive but fatalistic, a tacit acknowledgement that in every mortal marriage, someone does inevitably leave. A longtime centerpiece of their live performances together, ""You Are My Sunshine,"" now shared with the larger world, is a statement on commitment  to another person, and to one's own passion, which can stoke itself in frightening ways if not properly tended to. Hang your head and cry: love demands to be felt this way.

In two minutes every week, Alan paid his respects to good writing in his soft, intense, passionate voice.

Who ever read as much as Alan did? When he wasn't reading, he was teaching  over the years at Bennington, the University of Virginia, University of Michigan, and for the last two-plus decades, at George Mason University. And when he wasn't reading and teaching, he was writing. Five novels, novellas, short stories, textbooks.

It's a miracle that he found time for the solitude and concentration that writing demands: He was at the center of literary life in Washington, D.C., and a truly loving husband, father, and grandfather. But Alan did manage to do it all. Summers in Santa Cruz gave him solitary writing time, and time to teach at the Squaw Valley Writers Workshop. It was driving back from Northern California that he had the car accident.

Alan Cheuse was such a generous man. He always made time for his students. He always had suggestions to us, about writers to keep track of, as well as ones to avoid. He was a wonderful, caring, funny friend, full of stories and totally apt literary quotations. Good gossip too.

Those who knew him will remember him for all of that. Listeners will remember, and thank him, for all the reading in our behalf.

i toggle caption Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP

A decision to bar Canadian citizens from being future contestants on TV's Jeopardy quiz show is causing a range of reactions in Canada, particularly among those who note that show host Alex Trebek has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada.

Media outlets in Canada recently noted that their country is singled out in Jeopardy's eligibility guidelines:

""At this time we are precluded from accepting registration information from Canadian residents. We are currently evaluating this matter.""

That led the Toronto Star to note, ""Trebek may be one of the only Canadians on Jeopardy! next season.""

The situation is being attributed to differences in online privacy laws  but some Canadians aren't buying it. Here are the two top-rated comments on the CBC's story about the ban today:

""We kept winning that's why! If you can't beat'em, ban'em""  ComplacentCanadian

""This is in keeping with the general 'dumbing down' of Jeopardy questions. The last college championships were laughable. You only require knowledge of TV shows, American Presidents, and the Bible.""  Maggie M50

That CBC story, we'll note, was under the headline, ""I'll take Bummer for $400: Canadians no longer allowed on Jeopardy.""

An Ontario native, Trebek told the Ottawa Citizen last week that while Canadian contestants have been on the show in the past  and more are also competing in the current season  ""for the most recent Jeopardy! contestant tryouts, Canadians were precluded from taking the online test, since the show must now comply with new rules set down by the Canadian government.""

But Trebek also noted that once they're in the pool of contestants, people stay there for 18 months, meaning that Canadians who registered before the ban could still appear. He also said the show's producers hope to make sure it is in compliance with Canada's laws.

The precise snag that's keeping Canadians from signing up for future episodes of the show isn't being discussed in detail. Reports in Canadian media cite a statement from the producers of Jeopardy! in which they said, ""As international laws governing how information is shared over the internet are ever-changing and complex, we are currently investigating how we can accept registrations from potential Canadian contestants.""

Citing two legal experts, the Star says the law in question could be Canada's anti-spam legislation, which carries potential penalties of up to $10 million for abuse. The newspaper reports that the law, enacted in July of 2014, ""forbids companies from emailing citizens without their express or implied permission. In the U.S., it's enough to allow customers to opt-out.""

One other notable piece of online privacy legislation that recently took effect in Canada is the Digital Privacy Act. Enacted last summer, it sets rules for how personal information can be collected, used and disclosed. It also regulates how companies handle cybersecurity breaches and sets steep fines for companies that don't handle them properly.

When The National Post asked the office of Canada's Privacy Commissioner how many complaints Canadians had filed about Jeopardy! potentially violating their privacy, spokeswoman Tobi Cohen replied, ""I can tell you that our office has not been engaged in this matter.""","['information', 'privacy', 'jeopardy', 'canadian', 'companies', 'contestants', 'note', 'barred', 'online', 'trebek', 'questions', 'canadians', 'npr', 'twoway', 'left']"

They were Japanese-run prisoner of war camps in the Philippines. Likewise, Auschwitz was not a Polish death camp. It was a Nazi- (or German) death camp in Poland.

There's a pervasive sadness to Mothers' songs that's strangely disturbing: When Kristine Leschper sings, ""We lived unloved in unmade beds / You wore me like a necklace,"" it's hard not to want to reach out and lend her hope. When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired is filled with straightforward observations about frailty, broken trust and insecurity. The songs feel like the sole expression of the artist at their core, made with the support of friends like Matthew Anderegg on guitar, keyboards and percussion.

As a musician in Athens, Ga., Leschper has also found kindred spirits in neighboring bands: Deerhunter's Josh McKay plays vibraphone, while Grand Vapids' McKendrick Bearden supports these songs with lovely string arrangements. Another familiar name, producer Drew Vandenberg, has worked with Of Montreal and Kishi Bashi; his stark contribution seems to accompany a deep understanding of the songs. Everything on When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired feels essential, with nothing overplayed; the drama is simply stated.

It all might sound incredibly depressing, except that what art does best is serve as a means of growth. When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired sounds like the work of an artist who's seeking out an understanding of herself and the world around her. There's a deep underpinning of melancholy and sorrow here, but to watch these songs performed live is to witness a band that's growing into something fuller and more intense every day.

A powerful cyclone with gusts of up to 200 mph that ripped through the island nation of Fiji over the weekend killed at least 21 people, according to the United Nations.

Whole villages were flattened and at least four people were missing as a result of what the U.N. is calling ""one of the most severe [cyclones] ever to hit the South Pacific."" About 8,100 people remain in evacuation shelters.

The Category 5 storm tracked along the northern coast of Fiji's main island of Vita Levu, ripping the roofs off houses, flooding buildings and downing power lines and trees. The eye of the storm did not hit Fiji's capital, Suva, which is in southern Vita Levu.

As a nationwide curfew lifted this morning, Fiji is beginning the process of assessing the damage. The country of nearly 900,000 people comprises more than 300 islands.

Particularly hard-hit was the island of Koro, home to 3,450 people, which ""was in the eye of the cyclone and saw whole villages destroyed,"" the U.N. says. The government is sending an assessment and relief team to the battered island.

""There are Fijians out there who are without water, without a roof over their heads, without food and without essential services. It is our duty to determine their needs and provide them with the support they need as soon as possible,"" Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said in a press statement.

New Zealand was sending a plane Monday loaded with ""relief supplies and an emergency supply team,"" the country's foreign minister, Murray McCully, told Reuters.

One reason why it's been challenging to assess the damage from Cyclone Winston: There are still ""communication blackspots"" that the government has yet to reach, Oxfam in the Pacific's regional director, Raijeli Nicole, said in a statement.

""The Fijians are desperately trying to repair severed lines of communication, but they hold grave fears that the news waiting for them will be dire,"" she said.

""Given the intensity of the storm and the images we have seen so far, there are strong concerns that the death toll won't stop climbing today and that hundreds of people will have seen their homes and livelihoods completely destroyed,"" Nicole added.

The Fiji Times has this story about one cyclone victim named Sera Tinai:

""As strong winds and waves pounded Qelekuro Village in Tailevu on Saturday night, the wails of one-year-old Vive Marama was still heard and every villager was asking where her mother, Sera Tinai was. ""Marama's elder sister, 10-year-old Salacieli Serevi tried to comfort her and every other villager in the darkened village hall also tried to pacify the toddler with pancakes and food.

The way recording engineer Michael Reilly tells it in the liner notes of Panola County Spirit, Raymond Walker, the eightysomething patriarch of the Walker Family of Como, Mississippi, was always a singer of some renown. In fact, he was once the leader of a locally legendary (though never recorded) gospel vocal group called The Longtime Travelers.

According to Reilly, both Sam Cooke and Fred McDowell tried to coax Walker to accompany them on tour in the early 1960s, and both were refused ""on account of [Walker's] family needing him at home."" Brother Raymond and Sister Joella Walker ended up having four daughters and two sons, and all but one daughter have followed in their parents' footsteps by singing spirituals. As history would now have it, they're more than mere ""singers."" The Walkers are closer to standard-bearers of an a cappella gospel-singing tradition, which is front-and-center on the album Reilly recorded mostly in 2007  and mostly in Raymond and Joella's living room.

Though barely more than a minute long, the call-and-response ""Jesus Gave Me Water"" is harmonically rich beyond its time constraint. Unlike much of the album, it features the entire singing Family  including the children, Alberta, Bobby, Delouse, Patricia and Robert  participating in the seven-part uplift, with Raymond leading and the others following. The song itself, written by Lucie Campbell, one of the giant composers of African-American religious songs of the mid-20th century, tells the story from the Gospel of John, wherein Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well, offering her a drink of the water of eternal life.

The Walkers take it at a mid-tempo, foot-stomping stride  more straightforward than the popular Soul Stirrers version  with Raymond Walker's worn-down but still powerful voice expressing the nuance, both the initial thirst and the salvation, while the chorus punctuates the tale and the meaning. It's effortless and masterful, the kind of performance that feels as natural as breathing. Which is why it could hardly be more powerful.

npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,More Than A Marketing Trend,[],"The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing Trend

Here's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books  and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again. Those books would be Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins. So let's explore why those two are so influential.

Crime novelist Megan Abbott and Sarah Weinman of the newsletter Publisher's Lunch stopped by to discuss the phenomenon with NPR's Steve Inskeep. ""I have talked to other crime writers that have been urged by various professional people in their life to put the world girl in their title,"" says Abbott. ""It's not necessarily an issue with the content of the book itself, but there's this sort of shorthand that if it has 'girl' in the title, then I know what to expect.""

That calculus seems to be at work with a book that arrived recently at NPR's offices: Girl in the Dark, by Marion Pauw, described by its publisher as ""in the vein of blockbuster thrillers such as The Girl on the Train and The Good Girl,"" by Mary Kubica.

""I think there's really something at the root of the popularity of Flynn's and Hawkins' books that is far more important than branding or marketing,"" Abbott says, ""and I think it's the universal themes that you see in these books that speak to female readers.""

Interview Highlights

On what they read growing up

Abbott: I grew up reading crime fiction mysteries, true crime  a lot of true crime  and it is traditionally a male dominated field from the outside, but from the inside what we know, those of us who read it, is that women buy the most crime fiction, they are by far the biggest readers of true crime, and there's a voracious appetite among women for these stories, and I know I feel it  since I was quite small I wanted to go to those dark places.

Weinman: I was a voracious true crime reader, I followed trials, I read the newspapers. And I also wanted to circle back a bit because you opened the segment with Girl in the Dark by Marion Pauw, which I have happened to have read, and it's a really excellent novel. Marion Pauw is from the Netherlands, and that book, which was published there several years ago as Daglicht, was a huge bestseller and in a way calling it Girl in the Dark doesn't tell you what it's all about because it's partly about wrongful conviction, it's partly about juggling motherhood. So in a way, the girl insignia is trying to tie it into this larger marketing purpose, but sometimes it can be a disservice. Perhaps it's a notion that suspense by women is part of a broader field and of course it's been happening for decades ... this is not a new phenomenon.

On what women's crime novels have in common

Abbott: I think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train are great because they're not that similar books at all, but they're both dealing with the sort of perils of being a woman today, of marriages falling apart, of ambivalence with motherhood, the complexities of relationships among women  all this stuff that in some ways isn't taken very seriously by the culture at large, is considered  and I'm quoting here  ""women's magazine fodder,"" but it's actually very real to readers.

Weinman: Just to chime in as well, both of those books, what they have in common, what I think a lot of these other books that have climbed upon the ""girl train"" so to speak is ... people are gravitating towards these unreliable narrators. I know that when I read Gone Girl it was 2012, we were only a few years removed from the economic crash of 2008, a lot of people felt their lives were completely upended, they didn't know who to trust, and so a book like Gone Girl, which gets at the heart of a marriage that seems to be stable but is anything but, I really think that did speak to people.

On whether they still love the kind of crime writing they grew up with

Abbott: Yes, I mean, I certainly have a more gimlet eye about the world of publishing ... but the books themselves  it feels like a really exciting moment in the genre just to be able to have these heroines who might be considered too unlikable, just to have them embraced just feels kind of thrilling.

He loves Argentinian empanadas and dulce de leche. In 2015, he said that if he had only one wish, it would be to travel unrecognized to a pizzeria and have a slice  or two or three. In other words, he may be protected by the world's smallest army and be responsible for the spiritual governance of 1.2 billion people, but when it comes to eating, Pope Francis loves comfort food as much as the next person.

In fact, everyone whose return address lists ""Vatican City"" carries food close to their heart. Or so it would seem, judging by The Vatican Cookbook, which will be released in English in April 2016. It's a tour of life and food in the world's smallest country, as told by members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard.

Since the 1500s, the guard has consisted of Swiss men  who, at the time of the army's formation, were ""regarded as invincible,"" according to the book's forward. These men pledge to serve and protect the pope for, at minimum, a 25-month tour of duty. Their brightly striped gold, blue and red uniforms  as well as the plate armor and plumed metal helmets they occasionally don  make them hard to miss at the Vatican. Yet outside of the city, they're not widely known.

Polish nuns do the majority of cooking at the Vatican, but the Swiss Guard chefs do step in to make food on formal occasions or to fulfill a special request. Though a guard cooking is a rarity, these men know more about the pope's eating habits than anyone else, since they are no more than a few steps from him at all times.

This being the Vatican, the pope's presence (and the presence of popes past) is an important part of the book, but this is not a papal cookbook. The authors, David Geisser, Erwin Niederberger and Daniel Anrig, are all current or former members of the Guard. Geisser was a chef before joining the guard in 2012, and he is credited with bringing the Vatican Cookbook from idea to print.

The book is organized into sections focusing on the foods that define the people, places and celebrations of the Vatican. Each section has themed recipes, as well as intimate descriptions of life in the holy city.

At first, it seems hard to relate to anyone whose backyard consists of the Sistine Chapel, St. Peter's Basilica and the residence of the pontiff himself. Yet it's hard not to be enchanted by the book's charming earnestness  more of a community cookbook sensibility in a world of beautifully plated, exhaustively sourced cookbooks.

Among other things, The Vatican Cookbook reveals that when the Swiss Guard are off-duty, many of them put on the uniform of the FC Guardia soccer team. The Guardia play against teams made up of museum employees, postal workers, or other groups of Vatican employees for an intramural cup. Together, they occasionally compete in international competitions as the Vatican City National Football Team. Get your banners ready now.

Of course, the pope also has his downtime  some of which he takes during vacations at the Castel Gandolfo, a scenic village that is the ""historic summer home of the popes."" A recipe for eggplant mozzarella describes sourcing the ingredients from the working farm at the papal palace. (The pope even has a small herd of cows there.) With some exceptions, the foods included in this cookbook are humble and easy-to-make. This is not a papal feast but a glimpse into the mostly ordinary life at the Vatican. A footnote on a recipe for braised lentils notes that ""the Swiss Guard diet has included lentils several times a week for centuries.""

Pope Francis and his two immediate predecessors each get a section featuring their biography and favorite foods from their homelands of Argentina, Bavaria (Pope Benedict XVI) and Poland (Pope John Paul II). When Pope John Paul II was shot and wounded in 1981, doctors put him on a restricted diet while he recovered. His only request? Let him eat his native food, pierogis. Though doctors initially refused, the Cookbook notes that they eventually relented. As the authors note, who can say no to the pope?

Of course, officers of the Swiss Guard, a few of whom have wives and children who live at the Vatican, also get to shout out their favorite foods. Former Guard Commander Daniel Rudolf Anrig reveals his favorite food to be ""Cheese Tort Italiana"" (similar to a thin quiche), with one caveat:

""With respect,"" the cookbook notes, ""Anrig would like to add that his mother is chef and creator of the finest cheese tort in the world.""

For Anrig, like most of us, eating is an act of comfort. Even the best Swiss Guard chef or Polish nun would have trouble outdoing a recipe that mom used to make.","['reveals', 'pope', 'holy', 'institute', 'recipes', 'vaticans', 'favorite', 'artymiakcourtesy', 'guard', 'food', 'vatican', 'swiss', 'cookbook', 'katarzyna', 'ravioli', 'sophia']"

Adolescence is a time when ""friendship feels like something you die for,"" says Irish author Belinda McKeon. It's how she explains the characters in her new novel ""Tender"" to NPR's Rachel Martin.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Catherine Reilly and James Flynn are best friends. They meet in Dublin while Catherine is at college. She's an experienced student at Trinity College who has never had a romance. James is a charismatic and charming artist, gay in the late '90s, when it was difficult to be gay in Ireland. They connect with a force and intensity that makes their friendship special - so special, it feels life-sustaining. But it is also all-consuming and ultimately disastrous. The Irish writer Belinda McKeon's new book is about friendship, desire and the mistakes we make when we're young. The book is called ""Tender."" And she told us that she wrote Catherine and James' relationship as highly intense from the very beginning.

BELINDA MCKEON: But it's also that period of our lives - you know, they're 18 and 19 years old. So it's that time in life when friendship feels like something you'd die for. You meet with a person, and the connection is so incredible, and it's so deep. And you just can't get enough of them. You need - you know, you're looking forward to the next day and the next conversation. You don't want to go to sleep at night. You'll sit up all night talking. And so this is her first experience of a friendship like that. And it is all-consuming for her. So yeah, she's already I suppose confused by the nature or by the intensity of that attachment. But she's also quite a naive and - as I say, she's 19 years old. And she's from a rural background. This is her first year in the city. I wanted to write a very - a character who was very naive and who was blind to what was going on in her own emotional territory. And James becomes - really becomes a pretty severe test case for that.

MARTIN: When James comes out to Catherine as a gay man, it is not a shock to readers. But it is for Catherine. And she does not handle the moment well and behaves rather badly. Yet, you write that scene with a lot of compassion. How did you think of this character? Did - do you like her?

MCKEON: (Laughter) I - I have very mixed feelings. I have a complicated relationship with her I suppose. I mean, there's a lot of me in her. You know, there's a lot of my own self in Catherine, in her deep self-consciousness and her second-guessing of herself and that constant - almost as though there are three layers of inner monologue going on inside her head at all times. So she makes stupid mistakes. She says all the wrong things. And she's very self-regarding and quite self-absorbed. So I wouldn't say that I'm crazy about her. But I also do feel - I do understand her very deeply, I think. I mean, I created her, so I should. In that moment when James comes out, she actually is worried that he's going to ask her to marry him. That's how far away from having a clear view of reality she is. And that whole scene, I just wanted it to be so cringe-inducing. And my skin was crawling as I wrote it.

MARTIN: Yeah, I know - me too.

MCKEON: I needed readers' skin to do the same thing as they read it.

MARTIN: You say that there's a lot of you in Catherine. You also grew up where Catherine did. You went to Trinity. Does it extend further? Did you have a friendship like this, that was that intense?

MCKEON: I had a really intense friendship - and have, continue to have, thankfully, a very close friendship which inspired this book - its younger form, I would say, inspired this book. Its older form is much healthier and less dramatic. It was the late '90s. And like James, he was finding it - and I won't - I shouldn't speak for him. I won't say very much about his actual personal experience. But it was a difficult time to be gay in Ireland. And I think I wanted so much to be such a great friend to him. But I just ended up making things 10 times more difficult.

MARTIN: May I ask if you had romantic feelings for him?

MCKEON: Oh, we had more than romantic feelings. We were essentially having an affair.

MARTIN: Ah.

MCKEON: Yeah, never a dull moment.

MARTIN: Complicated.

MCKEON: (Laughter).

MARTIN: Do you think of this as a love story?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, it's a love story. Yeah, but you know, love has all sorts of motives. It comes from all sorts of needs. And it comes also from all sorts of cultural inheritances and hang-ups. So I think it is a love story but only because my understanding of what love is not just about happiness and togetherness. But it's just as much about the deeper psychological play that goes on.

MARTIN: Do you think how different this story would be if it were placed today? I mean, things are so different in Ireland now, the U.K. The resounding vote in favor of gay marriage passed in Ireland just recently.

MCKEON: Yeah, last May it was a tremendous day. I was there for that vote. It was an extraordinary, extraordinary day to stand in Dublin Castle and watch the votes coming in from each county. It was just - I can't describe how moving it was. But you know, the months coming up to that vote were really, really distressing because although the vote was carried by a large majority, there was a very vocal minority who were, you know, conservative lobby groups who were - got a lot of air time, basically. And so there was a lot of commentary which was deeply hurtful to LGBT people in Ireland, and especially to young LGBT people, talking about how they didn't deserve or shouldn't have this right. It wasn't a right and it wasn't something that should be extended. So I do think that if ""Tender"" was set now it would be - it would be different in many ways. But I have to say, I received a lot of correspondence from young LGBT people after the book was published, some of them not much younger than me and some a lot younger. And it did shock me how they talked about how they could deeply, deeply relate to what the characters had gone through and were going through.

MARTIN: Still, today.

MCKEON: Yeah, and that - you know, that really - that surprised me.

MARTIN: Has your friend read the book?

MCKEON: Oh, yeah, he has.

MARTIN: Yeah, he liked it.

MCKEON: He liked it. But, you know, I should say, the novel is - it is a novel. I mean, it took a - it took an autobiographical experience as its source, but it is almost entirely fiction.

MARTIN: Yeah.

MCKEON: And I'm not being coy by saying that because I did think, when I started writing it, that it - that writing autobiography might be the way to write this novel. That turned out not to be the case at all. You take the bones of what happened or you take the feelings, almost the phenomenological feeling of what happened. And you have to - you still have to write a novel. It's still the same work of building a story, building an arch, giving it a shape because life doesn't have a shape. So all of the things I thought would be useful at the beginning - the journals, the diaries, the letters and all those things I have - they turned out to be just distractions on the way to actually making the story. But yeah, he's been supportive of course. He's - you know, he's a wonderful person.

MARTIN: The book is called ""Tender."" It's written by Belinda McKeon. She joined us from our studios in New York. Belinda, thanks so much.

MCKEON: You're very welcome.

npr,,"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do",[],"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Occasionally, someone in a photo we have posted asks that we remove the image from our website.

Any such request must be redirected to:

 Kainaz Amaria or another editor from the Visuals team.

 Chuck and/or Gerry Holmes, the deputy managing editors.

In most cases, the correspondent producer or staff photographer who took the image will already be aware of the request, as will the editor who handed the report. If not, they will be drawn into the discussion by Kainaz, Chuck and/or Gerry.

Others who will be brought in:

 Digital ME Scott Montgomery.

 Standards & Practices editor Mark Memmott.

The executive editor, VP for News and SVP for News will be looped in too.

The issue of whether to remove an image is a serious matter. As weve said before when discussing requests to take down stories, we agree with the AP that:

We are guided by a newsroom policy that says it is inappropriate to remove content from our Website. If a report is inaccurate, we will correct it and state why it has been altered. If relevant new information emerges, we will update or do a follow-up story. But our content is a matter of public record and is part of our contract with our audience. To simply remove it from the archive diminishes transparency and trust and, in effect, erases history. This is not a practice engaged in by credible news organizations or in line with ethical journalism.

A key question that will be asked when such requests come in: What was the person told about how the photo or photos would be used?

It is important that people know were not doing stories that only go on the air. We spend time making sure they understand that the stories live on our website and that the photos we take will be there as well. And as weve said before:

Kainaz Amaria from NPRs visuals team says she has found that the more transparent I am about my intentions with people in my story, the more they are willing to share their time and moments. It may sound counterintuitive, but in fact its been proven to me every time I step out of the office and into someones life. If people trust you, trust you are there to listen and learn, youll be surprised at the access they will offer you. ... If people say, Wait you are radio, why do you want my picture? I usually say something like, Well, many of our stories go online to reach a wider audience and to get more eyeballs. Chances are if they see you, then they will connect with your story. 

Kainaz and the Visuals team have considerable experience dealing with this issue. If a request comes in, they should take the lead. In most cases, it should be someone from Visuals who gets back to the person who wants a photo removed.

npr,2010-07-18 00:00:00,Is One-Year Anniversary Redundant?,['Ben Zimmer'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Neale Gifford writes: ""One practice that annoys me is the use of 'one-year anniversary' or 'five-year anniversary' instead of 'first' or 'fifth.' Reason? Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""



Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)



The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""



What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.

As the annual aspect has moved to the background of anniversary, the shift has opened the door for use of the term to mark the passing of shorter units of time. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, in its entry for the word, states that anniversary can refer more broadly to a date following a notable event ""by a specified period of time measured in units other than years,"" giving the example, ""the 6-month anniversary of the accident.""



Linguists call this process ""semantic bleaching"": the lessening of a word's force through generalization. The bleaching of anniversary has been going on for quite a while, even if dictionaries are only now catching up. For more than a century, English speakers have been modifying anniversary with numbers of days, weeks or months. An article in the May 5, 1901, Atlanta Constitution described the Vanderbilt family's Biltmore mansion in North Carolina, where little Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt ""celebrated the three-months anniversary of her birth by planting out a tree on the estate."" A few years later, The San Jose Evening News reported on the unseemly nature of a widow marrying on ""the third-month anniversary of her husband's death.""



Anniversary has been pressed into service for nonannual commemorations in part because English has no other commonly used terms that can fill the gap. At various times since the 19th century, the monthly equivalent of anniversary has been dubbed a mensiversary, using the Latin root mensis for ""month,"" but this ad-hoc coinage has never caught on. (Members of the Facebook group ""Make 'Mensiversary' a Word"" continue to fight the good fight.) A more recent suggestion is the clunky English-Latin hybrid monthiversary.



With pressure on anniversary to expand its reach to subannual units, it's no wonder that ""nth anniversary"" can somehow feel insufficient for traditional yearly celebrations, in need of the more explicit form, ""n-year anniversary."" But if you don't want to see the meaning of the word weakened any further, stick to the ""nth"" version and trust that others will have the good sense to discern anniversary's annualness.","['yearly', 'word', 'writes', 'anniversary', 'redundant', 'vanderbilt', 'oneyear', 'nth', 'meaning', 'words', 'units']"

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Lizzie Skurnick, cultural critic of Harper Lee's books, about what she will be most remembered for.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

The author Harper Lee died today in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. She was 89. In 1960, she wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" which became one of the best-loved novels of the last century. In the book, a young white girl in the Depression-era South tells the story of her father, a lawyer, as he defends a black man. Then, last year, Lees' novel ""Go Set A Watchman"" was published. It portrays that same lawyer that many saw as a hero as a bigot. To discuss Lee's legacy, we called the writer Lizzie Skurnick. She remembers reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" as a child. It wasn't the portrayal of racial justice that captivated her; it was the young narrator.

LIZZIE SKURNICK: I was really struck by Scout, the heroine, and how she was experiencing the South - kind of a tomboy in a town that was a lonely town and going through a lot of changes.

SHAPIRO: Was that because you saw yourself in Scout? You're not from the South. You do have one black parent, one white parent.

SKURNICK: No, I don't think so. I think it's because, to me, that has always been the most emotionally interesting part of the book. And when I was younger, I really was more focused on narratives about girls - you know, ""Little House On The Prairie,"" ""Island Of The Blue Dolphins.""

SHAPIRO: Do you think part of the reason ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" remains so beloved is because the problems that she was writing about 50 years ago have not gone away?

SKURNICK: No, I don't think it's exactly that because, you know, a novel like ""Native Son"" by Richard Wright, those are the same problems, too, but, you know, you don't see that book everywhere anymore. I think the reason it hasn't gone away is that Atticus, you know, as the brave lawyer defending the black community, that's how we'd like to see our country. But, you know, by the same token, we'd like it to happen because we have a white hero, you know, and not from a black hero. And I think it's such an interesting thing to look at how devoted people are to Atticus as the savior of racism in our country.

SHAPIRO: Are saying that, in a way, it's a slightly more palatable, less complicated, more mainstream way of taking on these possibly less palatable, more complicated problems?

SKURNICK: Oh, absolutely because - there was an article in The New York Times about how people who'd named their sons Atticus were now having to rethink the name. And as a black person...

SHAPIRO: Because in the later novel, Atticus was revealed to be racist.

SKURNICK: Right. And all I could think of was, you know, well, they could have named their son Crispus Attucks, or they could have named him Martin Luther King, or they could have named him any, you know, of the many, many black heroes in the country. But, you know, we want that hero to be Atticus. And I think that's also something we should start to think about and reckon with.

SHAPIRO: There's a satirical headline in The Onion that says, nation to honor Harper Lee by ensuring novel about horrors of racism always remains relevant.

SKURNICK: (Laughter) In a way, I think that's, you know, a good thing. I mean, as you said, I'm also Jewish and, you know, never forget is a big one in the Jewish world. And I do think Harper Lee, she depicted the, you know, polarization in a Southern town so well. And I do think that that's a portrait we should be reading for decades to come.

SHAPIRO: Lizzie Skurnick, thank you so much for talking with us.

SKURNICK: Thank you.

SHAPIRO: Lizzie Skurnick is publisher of the young adult classics, Lizzie Skurnick Books, remembering Harper Lee with us, who died at age 89.

npr,,Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?,[],"Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?

The Tampa Bay Times knew well in advance that a Florida postal worker planned to fly a gyrocopter over Washington, D.C., and on to the grounds of the Capitol.

From what the Times has reported, there seems to have been no evidence that the man, identified as 61-year-old Doug Hughes, intended to do himself or anyone else any harm. Theres also a case to be made that the Times had reason to believe authorities were keeping tabs on Hughes. The Times knew he had been interviewed some months back by a Secret Service agent. That means Hughes was  in theory  on authorities virtual radar. (He wasnt, it turns out, on any actual radar this week).

It isnt the Times job, or the job of any news outlet, to be the police.

But, the many ways things could have gone badly on Wednesday arent difficult to imagine. Well set aside the Hollywood scenarios of fighter jets and missiles.

Still:

 Hughes might have fooled the Times and had nefarious intentions.

 He could have been shot.

 If shots were fired, bystanders could have been hit.

 People could have been injured during evacuations or as police responded to the scene.

At the very least, as happened, streets would be closed and traffic tied up for blocks around.

The Times reporter on the story tells The Washington Post that the news outlet spent hours and hours talking about the ethics of this, and decided there was no need to tell authorities well before Hughes planned launch. The Times ended up calling the Secret Service while Hughes was in the air, less than a half hour before he landed.

Media ethicists, as the Post notes, disagree:  A news organization should be extremely knowledgeable of the potential harm a stunt like this could cause, said Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. I really question their judgment. 

News outlets dont want sources to think reporters will run to the police about just anything potentially illegal that theyre told about.

But how about this? Apply common sense and weigh the value of the story against the potential harm to the public. That will continue to be our standard.

The news of Harper Lee's death hit her beloved hometown particularly hard. Fans and friends in Monroeville, Ala., reflect on her passing.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

Monroeville, Ala., is warning the death of novelist Harper Lee. She wrote ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" set in a place based on that town. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott spoke with Lee's fans and friends there.

KYLE GASSIOTT, BYLINE: Clay Brown was driving northeast from her home in Moss Point, Miss., to Monroeville when she heard the news about Harper Lee's death. Standing in the gift shop of the courthouse museum, she remembers reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and like the young heroine scout, awakening to the racism around her.

CLAY BROWN: You know, as children, you know there's something kind of hmm (ph), but you don't really understand what it is. And it's nice to have lived long enough to see things change.

GASSIOTT: Also visiting the gift shop is Monroeville resident Iris Matthews. She says she doesn't see any similarity between today's Monroeville and Maycomb, the fictional setting for the book.

IRIS MATTHEWS: That was something that happened in the past. Time has changed as years passed, you know. You do not forget, but you forgive, and you move on, and we grow.

GASSIOTT: Like others in town, Matthews remembers seeing the author of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in local restaurants and stores. And while she knew Lee never liked to be approached, she couldn't help but think...

MATTHEWS: Wow, of course, wow, you know, natural in-town celebrity.

GASSIOTT: Nathan Carter is the director of the courthouse museum and someone who grew up knowing Lee as both a personal friend and someone who was close to his cousin, Truman Capote. And Carter says he wouldn't even try to guess at what Capote might say about the death of his close friend.

NATHAN CARTER: No, I would not dare to do that. He would come up with something very, very clever and funny and memorable.

GASSIOTT: According to Carter, it's the literary contributions that Lee leaves behind that will be her legacy in Monroeville, a legacy that was further cemented by the publication of another novel last summer.

SPENCER MADRIE: When ""Go Set A Watchman"" came out, when we did the midnight release, it was totally frantic. We have never done anything like that before.

GASSIOTT: Spencer Madrie owns the Ol' Curiosities and Book Shoppe near the courthouse. On the day of ""Watchman's"" release in July, people lined up all day to buy the book from the store in Lee's hometown. Madrie says both books are special to Monroeville where ""Mockingbird"" has become a local industry.

SPENCER MADRIE: ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee is our signature. You can't move it. You can't take it somewhere else. You can't break it apart from Monroeville in any form or fashion. So that's something that keeps this city moving.

GASSIOTT: Arrangements for Lee's funeral have not been announced but are expected to be closed to the public. For NPR News, I'm Kyle Gassiott.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says last month was the warmest January on record. That sets off alarm bells for climate scientists, but for the average person living in a northern climate, it might not sound so bad.

That's what many people are saying these days in Russia, where the expected icy winter has failed to materialize this year  to widespread joy. Of course, any climate scientist will tell you that an unusually warm month  or even a whole warm winter  doesn't mean much. It's the long-term trend that counts.

But that's not how it appears to the popular imagination, says George Safonov, who heads the Center for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. He says there's a big temptation in northern countries to believe that warmer weather can bring economic opportunities, such as improving conditions for farming.

""Before 2010, we had a rising harvest rate for crops, and that was explained as a very positive impact of climate change,"" he says. ""It was not easy to convince people that this is not correct.""

The problem, Safonov says, is that while warmer weather might open up more land in cold regions such as Siberia, it's already causing havoc on existing farmland in the south.

Some of Russia's most productive farmland, the fertile steppes around Rostov-on-Don, has been facing a series of droughts.

""We had one-third of all harvests lost in 2010, one-fourth of all crops lost in 2012. And if you calculate, that was about $12 -$15 billion damage,"" he says. In other words, a huge loss for Russian farmers.

We went to the Rostov region to see what farmers are doing about all this.

There's nothing growing there now, but driving through the miles of plowed fields, you can see why this area is called the breadbasket of Russia.

The writer Anton Chekhov said it was so fertile, you could poke a stick into the ground and it would take root and grow.

Vladimir Dvornik runs an agricultural cooperative called Progress, a former Soviet collective farm. He says he and his fellow growers have had to change their crops to deal with drier conditions.

""We gave up growing some kinds of grain, soy and some vegetables, like peppers and tomatoes,"" Dvornik says. Now, he says he has switched to winter wheat and other crops that do well in drier weather.

He says it's not a catastrophe for local growers, because they've had time to adapt, but drought could cause severe problems if it keeps getting warmer.

As for moving Russian farming to Siberia, Dvornik says that's nonsense, and so does economist Safonov.

There's no infrastructure for farming there, Safonov says, no expertise and no population of potential farm workers. Between losing farmland in the south, and starting large-scale farming in the north, the costs would be huge.

""Overall, I would estimate these potential losses as a few dozens of billions of dollars per year if we don't do anything,"" Safonov says.","['great', 'farmland', 'nyet', 'winter', 'farmers', 'crops', 'climate', 'weather', 'safonov', 'dvornik', 'russian', 'farming', 'change']"

I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music Loading... I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music

""I'll Take You There"" is a 24/7 R&B and soul channel from NPR Music. Curated and hosted by Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, the playlist runs the gamut from the genre's origins in the 1940s to today's slow jam stunners. You can follow the program on Twitter at @NPRandB and Jason King's personal Twitter account at @jasonkingsays.

Rhythm and blues is a feeling. Rhythm and blues is about getting up to get down to get on the good foot to get happy and enjoy yourself when the suffering hits, when the blues wants to envelop you like a fog.

In the 1940s, R&B was the marketing term journalist-turned-Atlantic Records-producer Jerry Wexler coined to describe the raucous and jumpy sounds African-Americans were concocting in urban hotspots like New Orleans; it was a newfangled phrase to lift black music from the racist connotation of ""race music."" Rhythm and blues was '40s shouters like Wynonie Harris hollering over tight, post-swing rhythm combos  it was three-dimensional bass lines bouncing around driving beats and spastic saxophones honking like farm pigs.

By the '50s, white folks repackaged the music as rock 'n' roll, but it wasn't long before R&B sprouted new arms, extending itself into the gospelized frenzy of soul, the stairstep harmonies of doo-wop, the cool crossover pop of Motown, the hot circular grooves of funk in the '60s, the boudoir hush of quiet storm and the aspirational sleekness of disco in the '70s. But R&B also left its trace on Jamaican reggae, Nigerian afrobeat, Ghanaian highlife, Chicago and Detroit house, not to mention '80s boogie, synth-funk and hi-NRG, and all those British post-Northern-soul variants. Contrary to popular wisdom, the rise of drum machines and samplers in the '80s and '90s never killed R&B: the music only mutated, reformed, transmogrified and got itself a brand new bag in the form of new jack swing, hip-hop-soul, neo-soul, broken beat and drum 'n' bass. The energy never dies.

At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways.

What links R&B across all that space and time is its emphasis on dance, sex and romance. At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways. It's about being overjoyed and underpaid and living for the weekend and turning your house into a home. It's the music of picket lines and picket signs, of sin and salvation, of hustles, twists and Soul Trains. It's the soundtrack of cities being burned by riots, of communities struggling to be free, of people darker than blue saying it loud and proud to be right on and free. It's the music of corner bars and shabeens and dancehalls and supermarkets and bathhouses and weddings and barbecues and family reunions. It's happy feelings and silent tears, hot grits and raining men, tempestuous telephone calls and profound pillow talk. It's feel-deep music, vibration and frequency meant to resonate in the marrow of your bones and the cells of your blood.

I've curated a 24/7 stream of thousands of songs for NPR that reflect the vast range of what R&B was and what it is and where it's going. You're likely to hear anything from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard to Sylvester to Jodeci to Ruth Brown to IG Culture to Carl Hall to Disclosure to Dinah Washingtonto Roy Ayers to Kelela to The Righteous Brothers to Jorge Ben to Amos Milburn to Jeff Buckley to Louis Jordan.

The world has frozen over in the movie Snowpiercer. Set after a climate change disaster, all the action happens aboard a train that has to keep circling the globe for its passengers to stay alive.

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great train tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

The movie itself is uniquely international: Snowpiercer is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. It's directed by a Korean auteur and stars Hollywood A-listers including Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris. The movie opened in South Korea last summer. Since then it has played all over the world, and certain Americans have been wildly impatient for Snowpiercer to open here.

What kinds of Americans, you ask? Well, film nerds, science fiction nerds, Tilda Swinton nerds and fans of director Bong Joon-ho.

Grady Hendrix, who co-runs the New York Asian Film Festival, says Bong's movies, such as 2003's Memories of Murder, masterfully subvert genres. ""His serial killer movie was actually an amazing movie about Korean history but also delivered the thrills you want in a serial killer movie,"" he explains.

And Bong's 2006 movie The Host was both a sly critique of American intervention in Korea dating back to the Korean War  and about a giant monster eating people. The Host smashed South Korean box office records and became an international sensation.

i toggle caption Radius TWC Radius TWC

So it was hardly a surprise when the director's next big action film  Snowpiercer  was immediately snapped up by Hollywood distributors Bob and Harvey Weinstein.

""Uncle Harvey. We had a long process,"" Bong wryly remembers during an interview at NPR West in Culver City.

Snowpiercer's U.S. release was delayed for months as Bong and Weinstein  known in the film world as Harvey Scissorhands  wrangled over Weinstein's insistence over cutting 20 minutes from the two-hour film and adding a voice-over. Bong adamantly refused. The international film community rallied behind Bong Joon-ho. Eventually, the Weinsteins agreed to release Snowpiercer intact.

""Their idea to simplify was a very silly one,"" Hendrix observes. ""The movie is incredibly simple. It is a train. The poor people live in the back. The rich people live in the front. And the poor people in back want to get to the front.""

Bong says an oppressed underclass rebelling against huge wealth gaps is not exactly science fiction right now. ""[It's] similar to Occupy Wall Street in terms of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent,"" he says. ""That's something that happens in other countries and also in Korea.""

The film has been getting rave reviews, partly because of Bong's knack for keeping viewers off balance. Take a meditative, dreamlike scene where the freedom fighters pause for a snack in a train car that's also an aquarium and a sushi counter. (Of course, sushi is sort of shorthand for the preferred food of the 1 percent.)

npr,,Be Sure To Ask Experts About Connections To The Candidates,[],"Be Sure To Ask Experts About Connections To The Candidates

This is already happening, but its important not to forget that as we line up experts for two-ways and interviews about public policy issues, we need to know if theyre connected to or publicly support one of the presidential campaigns. A standard question these days should be something like are you advising any of the campaigns? Or, have you been called by any of the campaigns or candidates? Or, are you publicly supporting one of the candidates?

Check with them about connections to public policy groups and advocacy organizations as well.

We look for expertise on a wide variety of subjects that are campaign issues. They include climate change, criminal justice, economics, foreign affairs, immigration, national security and tax policy. The list could go on.

A yes response to one of our questions doesnt automatically disqualify someone, but it is information we need to know, weigh and tell our listeners and readers if its decided that person should be part of our report.

Meanwhile, our responsibility doesnt end with a no response from the expert. Trust, but verify. Do some searches to be sure that person hasnt shown up in stories about economists who support Smith or historians who are advising Jones. The expert may have an explanation. After all, campaigns sometimes exaggerate their support and academics sometimes sign on to things without quite realizing what theyve done.

Its also important to know whether someone has advised candidates or groups in the past. That information may help put the experts thinking in context.

How far down the ballot do we need to go? Its wise to ask whether theyre connected to any House, Senate or statewide races. We would also want to know if an expert in a particular field has gotten involved in a specific story  the Flint water crisis, for example.

The Colombian film ""Embrace of the Serpent"" tells the story of Amazon exploration not through European, but indigenous eyes. It's a contender for the Best Foreign Language Oscar.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Can time go backwards? Can two people from different generations be the same person? These questions are at the heart of a new film from Colombia called ""Embrace Of The Serpent."" It's not exactly science-fiction, but it is a fictional glimpse into how indigenous peoples in the Amazon see the world. It's also up for an Oscar for best language foreign film. And it has just opened in this country. NPR's Tom Cole has the story behind the film.

TOM COLE, BYLINE: To understand the Amazon, director Ciro Guerra says you have to lose your mind.

CIRO GUERRA: Losing all the preconceptions that I had about storytelling, about the world, you know, and learning to see the world from a different perspective. It sounds romantic, but it's not an easy process at all.

COLE: It's certainly tough on one of Guerra's characters, a German explorer struggling for his life against an unnamed disease. The only thing that can save him is a rare plant. And the only man who can find it is a shaman named Karamakate.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT"")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character, foreign language spoken).

GUERRA: The story of the Amazon is a story that has been told by Europeans, you know, by Germans, by Canadians, by Americans.

COLE: Not so much, he says, by Colombians. In fact, Guerra based his story on the diaries of two explorers, German Theodor Koch-Grunberg and American Richard Evans Schultes. There work is some of the only documentation of cultures that have since vanished. But Guerra did not want white men to be his protagonists. So ""Embrace Of The Serpent"" is told from the points of view and in the languages of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon. He went there before shooting began, with a script written mostly in Spanish.

GUERRA: We translated the script together with them. And during the process of translation, they rewrote the scripts. They put a lot into it. They made it their own. There are names of plants or chants or certain rites and everything that you cannot come across it in a movie. You know, you cannot learn about them casually. So the film doesn't have value in the ethnographical, anthropological. It's fiction.

COLE: The two explorers are given fictional names. But as in real life, they travel to the Amazon roughly a generation apart, in the early-to-mid 20th century. In the film, they're both guided by Karamakate, as a young man early in the story and later as an old shaman. He and the outsiders share a desire for knowledge - self knowledge and an understanding of the world around them, says the film's co-screenwriter, Jacques Toulemonde.

JACQUES TOULEMONDE: We wanted to make a meeting between wise people. There's this indigenous, wise man. And these explorers, they are also people with knowledge. And they are the first who come to the jungle and to the Amazon treating the indigenous like people and seeing them like people and interested in what they thought and what they believed in.

COLE: And what they believe in real life is complicated. Theodor Koch-Grunberg wrote in his diary that indigenous peoples in the Amazon see these outsiders following in each other's footsteps as the same person, a single soul traversing across several lives. They also see time as something that doesn't proceed inexorably into the future. In one scene, the elderly Karamakate gazes across the river into the past, where the German explorer from decades before staggers to the opposite bank.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT"")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Karamakate, foreign language spoken).

COLE: Karamakate says, ""to become a warrior, every Cohiuano man must leave everything behind and go into the jungle, guided only by his dreams. In that journey, he has to discover, in solitude and silence, who he really is.""

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT"")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Karamakate, foreign language spoken).

COLE: Both the old and young Karamakates are portrayed by indigenous men, neither of them professional actors. The old shaman is played by Antonio Bolivar Salvador.

GUERRA: His indigenous name is Safillamar.

COLE: Director Ciro Guerra.

GUERRA: He has an incredible story because he's one of the last Ocaina people left. The Ocaina people are - and the Ocaina language is basically about to disappear in this generation. You know, there are very few people that speak it. And he's one of them.

COLE: The Ocaina and many of the other indigenous peoples of the Amazon were nearly wiped out during the rubber boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Outsiders came into the jungle, enslaved the tribes to harvest the rubber and killed those that resisted. As young Karamakate tells a group of children...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT"")

NILBIO TORRES: (As young Karamakate, foreign language spoken).

COLE: ""One day, they will finish all the food in the jungle. You are still small, so the jungle will forgive you. Every plant, every tree, every flower is full of wisdom. Never forget who you are or where you came from. Don't let our song fade away.""

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT"")

TORRES: (As young Karamakate, foreign language spoken).

COLE: The loss of the culture is one of the main reasons Ciro Guerra wanted to tell their story.

GUERRA: The problem now is that young people, young indigenous people, are not so interested in preserving traditional knowledge. So for them, seeing that it was important for us and for the outside world, this traditional knowledge, it was a big deal to them.

COLE: And ""Embrace Of The Serpent"" has been a big deal for Colombians outside the Amazon. It's been showing continuously there for more than three months. And the Oscar nomination, the film's producer says Colombians are comparing it to having the national team in the World Cup. Tom Cole, NPR News.

Purchase The Music Pre-Order From iTunes Pre-Order From School Of Seven Bells

""Clouds came in / Pushing through a window open to the wind."" Those are the first haunting lines of ""Confusion,"" one of the standout tracks on School Of Seven Bells' new SVIIB, sung in an icy whisper by Alejandra Deheza. It's a delicate song, serene and full of ethereal synths, but it belies the roiling turmoil just below its surface. As Deheza recently revealed, ""Confusion"" was the final song she wrote with the duo's other half, singer and multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Curtis, while he was undergoing treatment for cancer in 2013  treatment that ultimately couldn't keep Curtis alive. Throughout the song, the pain is palpable.

Few bands know in advance exactly what their last album will be. For School Of Seven Bells, there's no question; SVIIB, the group's fourth full-length, is its swan song. Curtis' death three years ago at 35  after a yearlong battle with a rare form of lymphoma  has sealed School Of Seven Bells' fate, leaving a body of work that transcends synth-pop by reaching higher, deeper and broader. SVIIB is the duo's crowning achievement. Shadowed by death and encased in digital production, it's nonetheless warm and beautiful.

Deheza and Curtis began as musical collaborators before becoming romantically involved, a relationship that eventually reverted to a creative friendship before Curtis fell ill. That tumultuous bundle of emotion echoes throughout SVIIB. Deheza was left to complete much of the album alone, and loneliness permeates every moment  even the disc's most dance-friendly track, ""Signals,"" an electro workout that shivers from a chilly distance. ""On My Heart"" is a heartsick tug-of-war summed up in the lines, ""There was a you before me / There was a me before you."" Love, like the act of making music together, is never simple; Deheza and Curtis wrap up that complexity in immaculate, hook-filled bursts like ""Awake,"" with its sleek harmonies and retro-Eurythmics pulse.

In spite of its backstory, SVIIB is by no means mired in gloom. Its melancholy, reflective undertow is kept at bay by the elegance and brightness of songs such as ""This Is Our Time,"" with its assurance that ""We are free to dream""  a statement that might sound hollow in another context, but here gets delivered with a bittersweet edge. ""It kept you sane through the heartache and the pain,"" Deheza sings in ""Open Your Eyes,"" a soaring pop anthem filtered through unimaginable grief. Tragedy may loom large over SVIIB, but the album is as much about acceptance, redemption and the solace of memory as it is about loss.","['album', 'seven', 'curtis', 'song', 'sviib', 'school', 'deheza', 'treatment', 'left', 'bells']"

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm the anchor real men tattoo onto their chest - Bill Kurtis.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: And here's your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill. Thank you so much. The year...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: ...Has hardly begun, but it is never too early to indulge in nostalgia. So we're going to present to you this week some things we really enjoyed from the last year.

KURTIS: Because we thought about doing a show from the beach on Saint Barths, but the - well, the sand kept getting in the microphones.

SAGAL: One of the most fun and certainly one of the most tasty interviews we've done recently was with acclaimed chef and television personality, Jacques Pepin.

KURTIS: Peter began by jumping right in on his favorite topic - eating.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

SAGAL: Oh, it's such a pleasure.

PEPIN: Yes.

SAGAL: So I have to say that I have been reading your memoir this week, and it is - it's called ""The Apprentice."" It is so charming, a story...

PEPIN: I'm sorry, put you to sleep, right?

SAGAL: No, it was delightful. And I've even been making the recipes - like, I made the eggs in the style of your mother Jeannette. They were delicious.

PEPIN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

SAGAL: It was awesome.

PEPIN: Yeah, you liked it?

SAGAL: They were delicious. I would say thank your mother for me, but I'm sure it's too late for that. They're just...

PEPIN: Not that late - she only died last year.

SAGAL: Really?

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Only died last night.

SAGAL: OK, well, her eggs were great. Some of the things...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Now, just to sort of fill in our audience if they don't know, you grew up during the war in France.

PEPIN: Yes.

SAGAL: Times were tough, and you describe some of the things your mother made for you, including a dish that I think you called mou? Am I...

PEPIN: Yeah, mou. Yes, right, mou.

SAGAL: And was that the one with the lung?

PEPIN: That's delicious (laughter). This is the lung of a lamb, usually or calf. So, you know, what you have to do - because when you buy the lung the air has gone out of it. So it kind of shrank - so first, you have to blow - you have to blow into the trachea to expand the lung.

SAGAL: Yeah.

PEPIN: And then you cut it into pieces, and you do it with onion and red wine. It's really disgusting.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

LUKE BURBANK: I'm pretty sure that dish will get you arrested here the in the States, chef.

BLOUNT: Is that why you call it mou, because when you cut into it, it...

PEPIN: It moos (laughter). Yeah, it moos.

SAGAL: Now when your - you have a daughter.

PEPIN: Yes.

SAGAL: And when she was little, did you say something to her, like, oh, I'm going to cook for you what my mother made for me when I was your age. Here is some lung.

PEPIN: Yes, I did it.

SAGAL: You did? You made lung for your daughter?

PEPIN: But she was 3 years old. At that age, she could not refuse it.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And has she forgiven you now, sir?

PEPIN: No, not really.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Your story though is amazing. You were making - you were a professional chef by the age of 17. And you ended up - I couldn't believe this - cooking for Charles de Gaulle, the president of France.

PEPIN: Actually, from '56 to '59, I cooked for three French presidents and the three of them are dead.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: How much lung did you feed them, chef?

PEPIN: Well, until they died.

SAGAL: Not your fault though? You...

PEPIN: Not my fault, yes, not my fault.

SAGAL: So you say - OK, you had just finished cooking for the president of France. And I'm assuming...

PEPIN: Yeah.

SAGAL: ...You could've gone to work at any restaurant in Paris, maybe opened your own. But you decided to go to America. Why?

PEPIN: Because America was the golden fleece, you know, the El Dorado. I say I'll go there for a year or two and learn the language. And I'm here half a century later, and I still haven't gotten the language right.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's better than my French. What was American cuisine cooking like when you came to America, say that was around 1950 or so?

PEPIN: 1959, the end of 1959, yes. It was only - there was one salad in the supermarket. That was iceberg.

SAGAL: Iceberg lettuce, yeah.

PEPIN: Yeah, there was no lettuce. There was no leaks, no shallots and I remember going to Midtown, Manhattan, and asking at a supermarket where are the mushrooms? They say aisle five, and that was canned mushrooms. They didn't have any fresh mushrooms at the time. So it was quite a different world.

SAGAL: And you didn't immediately jump back into the ocean and start swimming back to France.

NEKO CASE: Seriously.

PEPIN: No, the beef was incredible. The beef was incredible and the lime and the lobster. And the girls were beautiful in New York, too.

SAGAL: Oh, yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And by the end of the 60s though, you were a very well-known chef, is that not right?

PEPIN: Well, not really. By the end of the 60s, I was working for Howard Johnson.

SAGAL: Wait a minute. You worked for Howard Johnson. For people who dont remember because theyre almost gone, Howard Johnson was this chain restaurant...

PEPIN: The fried clams...

SAGAL: Yes.

PEPIN: ...And the clam chowder - yes, it was terrific.

SAGAL: You made the recipe for those fried clams that I ate I dont know how much of?

PEPIN: Well, I didnt make the recipe. I improved the recipe.

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: It was very good. It was a family restaurant and good price. And they did an incredible Manhattan. And thats where I learned how to make cocktails.

SAGAL: Make cocktails?

PEPIN: Yes, right. Yes. And thats where I learned how to make the proper hamburger as well, so...

SAGAL: Really?

PEPIN: Yeah.

SAGAL: Can you tell...

PEPIN: I learned a lot.

SAGAL: Can you tell us, as one of the most acclaimed chefs really in the world, what is the secret to the correct hamburger?

PEPIN: Well, mine, I do it with - with brisket - you know, Jewish brisket...

SAGAL: Oh, I know it well.

PEPIN: ...Big, fat Jewish brisket...

SAGAL: Yeah.

PEPIN: OK, you do it, OK. So I ground that and etch out the right amount of fat, do this and make it very juicy. And when you put it on the grill, dont press on it. You take the juice out of it. And I like it with iceberg lettuce and onion and tomato. And I toast my bread, and I rub it with garlic after they are toasted. And I make the best hamburger you ever have in your life.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That sounds pretty awesome.

(APPLAUSE)

PEPIN: Yes.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: When you go into a restaurant, is the restaurant terrified to cook for you? You're Jacques Pepin.

PEPIN: I hope so.

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: No, they are not. They are not, no.

SAGAL: If you ever get a restaurant - go to a restaurant where you don't know the owner and the food is bad, do you send it back? Do you say something? Or do you...

PEPIN: No, no, the chef come and - you know, and he asked me what do you think? And I usually say, you know what? You'll never be better than today.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That's - that's very good.

PEPIN: Yeah, take it the way you want.

SAGAL: We actually - we had a question for you. I'm going to ask it. Let's assume that you knew the world was about to end - tomorrow, Donald Trump's inauguration. So this...

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: Oh, my God.

SAGAL: So this is your last meal.

PEPIN: Right.

SAGAL: What would you choose for your last meal?

PEPIN: Well, if it's my last meal, it's going to be very, very, very, very long.

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: Like, three months or...

SAGAL: Well, chef Jacques Pepin, it is a pleasure to talk to you. We have asked you here to play game we're calling...

KURTIS: Lift, Support but for the Love of God Please Don't Separate.

SAGAL: You are Jacques Pepin, famous chef. But what do you know about jockstraps?

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: Jacques who?

SAGAL: Jockstraps - famous undergarment. Jockstraps, we're going to ask you three questions about...

PEPIN: Oh, Jockstraps.

SAGAL: Jockstraps, you know what they call them in France - le strap de Jacques (ph).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Get two right...

PEPIN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

SAGAL: Yeah, he's got it. Get two of these questions right and you will win our prize for one of our listeners. Bill, who is chef Jacques Pepin playing for?

KURTIS: Marcela Marin of Los Angeles, Calif.

SAGAL: All right, here we go, chef, your first question. Now, the jockstrap as we know it was first developed and sold back in 1874 specifically for what purpose? Was it A - to provide support and comfort for men wearing Turkish pantaloons, which were the rage at that time...

PEPIN: Wow.

SAGAL: ...B - for racing-horse jockeys, right, to provide protection and stability because it actually was strapped to the saddle, or C - for, quote, ""bicycle jockeys,"" riding on the bumpy cobblestone streets of Boston.

PEPIN: I would say that it would be the Boston jockey - I've been to Boston.

SAGAL: Right, and the roads are terrible. You're right, chef.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It was, in fact, the bicycle jockeys.

(APPLAUSE)

PEPIN: Is that?

SAGAL: Yeah. I mean, apparently, there were enough people riding bicycles in Boston and complaining that this company started making these straps for them. And that is why - this is true - the company that invented the jockstrap and still sells the most of them is called Bike.

PEPIN: Believe me, I know my jockstraps.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This sort of thing never came up during those years with Julia Child, did it?

PEPIN: Never.

SAGAL: Next question, chef. Next question - once the jockstrap was invented, competitors decided to improve it. Which of these was invented in the early 20th century? Was it A- the cast-iron jockstrap, B - the electric jockstrap or C - the opium-infused jockstrap.

PEPIN: Oh, wow, wow, wow, - I think I would...

(LAUGHTER)

PEPIN: I would go for the opium one.

SAGAL: The opium one - that would be fun, but it was, in fact, the electric jockstrap.

PEPIN: Electric?

SAGAL: Electric, yes.

PEPIN: That's not fair to us.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I know it comes as a shock, but yes, it was...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's called the Heidelberg Electric Belt. It was supposed to cure insomnia, erectile dysfunction and other problems via electricity through the jock. All right...

(LAUGHTER)

BURBANK: Insomnia?

CASE: That is messed up.

SAGAL: That is messed up, but no...

BURBANK: Eventually you'd pass out from the pain, and I guess that is a cure for insomnia.

SAGAL: I guess so.

PEPIN: Yeah, right.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Last question - now, as you know, chef, progress moves ever forward. And as compression pants have become more popular in the athletic world, jockstraps have to keep up. One inventor recently came up with which of these? A - the bulletproof jockstrap, B - the Internet-enabled jockstrap or C - the combination gun jockstrap.

PEPIN: I would say the first one.

SAGAL: The bulletproof jockstrap?

PEPIN: Yeah, yes.

SAGAL: You are correct, chef, that is right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Well, if you think about, you know, your standard body armor has a little - you know, there's exposure down below. So...

PEPIN: Yes.

SAGAL: ...This guy has invented a bulletproof jockstrap. And you can see him demonstrate to its use in an incredibly horrifying video.

(LAUGHTER)

CASE: Wow.

SAGAL: Bill, how did chef Jacques Pepin do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Two out of 3, the chef knows what he's doing.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Jacques Pepin is an award-winning chef and TV host. His new book ""Jacques Pepin Heart & Soul In The Kitchen"" is out now, along with a new version of his fabulous memoir ""The Apprentice."" Jacques Pepin, thank you so much for talking with us.

SAGAL: Now, you think freshness is going to be really important with a meat vending machine. You'll want to find out which item is the most popular - you know, your ground beef, your sausages and therefore regularly restocked and which is like the meat equivalent of honey buns. You know what I mean.

(LAUGHTER)

MO ROCCA: Are they also going to get Chipotle vending machines over there?

ROCCA: I mean, it just doesn't sound very safe.

SAGAL: Why would you want to buy your meat from a vending machine?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Trying to figure out a way to get people in that confession booth.

ROBERTS: Yeah but multitasking.

SAGAL: All right, here is your last limerick.

SAGAL: Yes, indeed.

KURTIS: Yoga teacher.

SAGAL: This...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This Valentine's Day, couples in Calgary can celebrate their love for each other with couples' nude yoga - great way to get in shape and see a side of your partner you've never seen before and never want to see again.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Really there is a reason why God created Lululemon, please stand back up. I have to ask you - this is a total coincidence that we're asking you this limerick - you are a yoga teacher. What do you, a yoga teacher, think of the idea of coed nude yoga?

RICKETTS: Well, not something for me.

SAGAL: No.

ROCCA: Downward dog, downward, downward.

(LAUGHTER)

npr,,No Change In The Way We Introduce The Islamic State,[],"No Change In The Way We Introduce The Islamic State

(Note on Aug. 19, 2015: This guidance has been mostly superseded. Go here to see our new guidance.)

Five months after we issued guidance on how to refer to the group known as the Islamic State, is it time to do away with the rule that listeners and readers be reminded that it is self-declared, self-proclaimed, self-styled or known as?

The consensus from the foreign desk editors is that it is not time to do that.

The reasoning remains the same:

 The words help distinguish the Islamic State from nations, such as the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

 Not adding the words implies that the organization is a state, when in fact it is not an independent government ... within defined borders. Those are key parts of the words definition.

There is one tweak to the guidance. So-called is not one of the phrases we should rely on. It doesnt convey as much information as self-declared or self-proclaimed, which make clear to listeners and readers where the name came from.

Related note: ISIS remains our style on second reference. If someone we speak with uses ISIL or Daesh, we can again remind the audience that the group is also known by those names. Also, if a show has already introduced the Islamic State in one segment, theres probably no need to go through the self-proclaimed/self-declared/etc. steps again in a subsequent segment.

Ra Ra Riot has been making music together for over a decade, and has just released its fourth album, Need Your Light. Fans of the band know that it incorporates string instruments with traditional rock ones  but in the early years, that fact threw some people.

""People probably expected a rock-y, party band to just be bass, drums, guitar and vocals,"" says singer Wes Miles. ""They'd say 'What is that?' and we'd say, 'Oh it's a cello.' And, 'It's a violin.'""

The group got its start playing house parties in college. Miles says that's where he and his bandmates developed their exuberant sound, competing with the hum of young people having a good time.

""The house party vibe is not really a place to get emotional and quiet,"" says Miles. ""So basically, when we started, we had to make sure the attention was always coming toward us  you know, being loud and a little crazy.""

Ra Ra Riot decided to make a go of it after college  and having ""indie rock with strings"" as an angle helped it stand out. But a lot can change in the course of a decade.

After two albums, the members decided the description was confining. They started experimenting with a little less strings, and a little more synth. They said goodbye to their longtime cellist, and took some time off. But the core group is grateful for the way it's been able to evolve together.

""It's a sibling sort of relationship,"" Miles says. ""And all the flaws and all the insecurities, we've gotten really good about navigating around them. You know, you just have to accept people how they are and love them for what they do for you.""","['little', 'riot', 'indie', 'started', 'say', 'miles', 'know', 'rock', 'really', 'strings', 'ra']"
npr,,Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories,[],"Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories

Flatly saying or writing that Planned Parenthood officials have been secretly recorded discussing the sale of fetal tissue is akin to concluding that they committed a crime. That is a problem. We should not attach such judgments to people or institutions until the confessions or convictions are in.

Weve been on the story. Meanwhile, both FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have explored what is and isnt known at this point about what Planned Parenthood has done. FactCheck links to the 1993 law that defines what is and is not legal regarding the use of fetal tissue. Here are two key sections:

 PURCHASE OF TISSUE  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.

 The term valuable consideration does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.

The video makers and other Planned Parenthood critics say the organization was selling fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the tissue has been donated, not sold, and that only the organizations costs (reasonable payments) have been covered.

The facts are not all in.

For now, just as we would report that prosecutors say John Doe robbed the bank, we should attribute references to fetal tissue being sold. Theyre coming from Planned Parenthoods critics, for example. Conversely, at this point it is for Planned Parenthood to say  not us  that these were donations, not sales.

In the short space of a Newscast spot, an allegedly or accused of may be required when there isnt time to say more.

There are cases to be made for saying that Planned Parenthood officials were heard discussing how they could provide fetal tissue to researchers, or how those researchers could procure or obtain it. The issue of money being paid should be addressed in most reports. But, again, attribution is important when characterizing those payments.

Music reviewer Tom Moon says the latest from gospel-soul icon Mavis Staples is the most stirring of her recent releases. He reviews Livin' on a High Note.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Here's a music collaboration you might not expect.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""JESUS LAY DOWN BESIDE ME"")

MAVIS STAPLES: (Singing) Jesus, lay down beside me. Lay down and rest your troubled mind.

SIEGEL: That's gospel-soul pioneer Mavis Staples singing ""Jesus Lay Down Beside Me."" Rocker Nick Cave wrote this song for Staples' new album, ""Livin' On A High Note."" The record also features songs written for her by other artists, including Tune-Yards, Aloe Blacc, Neko Case and Ben Harper. Reviewer Tom Moon says the album recalls the intensity of Staples' 1960s heyday with The Staple Singers.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

TOM MOON, BYLINE: Mavis Staples has been doing pretty much the same thing for over five decades - turning Sunday school platitudes like ""Respect Yourself"" into urgent-sounding crusades.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""RESPECT YOURSELF"")

THE STAPLE SINGERS: (Singing) Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. They say, my word, you might get me fired. What a terrifying time to raise our voices.

MOON: When the 76-year-old-icon began working on this album, she put the word out. She wanted upbeat, affirmative songs.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MOON: The songwriters, many associated with indie rock, responded by updating The Staple Singers' sound from the '60s and early '70s. The recipe - uplifting messages tucked inside addictive pop hooks over steady, rolling grooves.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LOVE AND TRUST"")

STAPLES: (Singing) Lusting a villain, but stealing from a thief. Storm after storm leave you shaking like a leaf. They say broken hearts make the world go around, creating headaches or heartaches, only get you down. Give it some time. Don't try to rush when you're trying to find yourself some love and trust.

MOON: Just about every song offers some inspirational thought - cultivating inner strength, supporting friends, standing up for what's right. Among the most powerful tracks is ""MLK Song"" from producer M. Ward, which is built around phrases from Dr. Martin Luther King's final sermon.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MLK SONG"")

STAPLES: (Singing) And in the march for peace, tell them I played the drum when I have to meet to my day. In the crawl for justice, I helped somebody run. In the walk for the hungry, I fed someone. And in the march for peace, tell them I played the drum when I have to meet my day.

MOON: Mavis Staples has made several really strong records in recent years. One even won her a Grammy this month. But this album stands apart for the songs themselves, which bring a refreshing lightness to message music and also for the way she sings them, with that quiet yet fierce gospel spirit.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TAKE US BACK"")

STAPLES: (Singing) Sometimes life can get you in a hurry, but I'm just going to take it slow now. That don't mean I ain't been working, y'all.

SIEGEL: The latest from Mavis Staples is called ""Livin' On A High Note."" Our reviewer is Tom Moon.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TAKE US BACK"")

STAPLES: (Singing) I'm taking some time to see the people who keep me going. Sometimes hope can lead you down a bad line. Now, I'm not saying that I'm not judging now. I'm just going to tell you what to tell them now. I got friends, and I got - I got family. I got help from all the people who love me. I got friends, and I got - I got family. I got help from all the people who love me.

npr,,Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone,[],"Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone

The particulars of Rolling Stones failure make clear the need for a revitalized consensus in newsrooms old and new about what best journalistic practices entail, at an operating-manual-level of detail.

That line from the Columbia Journalism Reviews dissection of Rolling Stones infamous investigation of an alleged gang rape underscores why the CJR report is highly recommended reading. It reminds us that the basics matter  a lot.

CJR concludes that better and clearer policies about reporting practices, pseudonyms and attribution might well have prevented the magazines errors. ... Stronger policy and clearer staff understanding in at least three areas might have changed the final outcome. From the report:

 Pseudonyms. [Editors] said using pseudonyms at Rolling Stone is a case by case issue that requires no special convening or review. Pseudonyms are inherently undesirable in journalism. They introduce fiction and ask readers to trust that this is the only instance in which a publication is inventing details at its discretion. Their use in this case was a crutch  it allowed the magazine to evade coming to terms with reporting gaps. Rolling Stone should consider banning them. If its editors believe pseudonyms are an indispensable tool for its forms of narrative writing, the magazine should consider using them much more rarely and only after robust discussion about alternatives, with dissent encouraged.  Checking Derogatory Information. [The reporter and her editor] made the fateful agreement not to check [a key part of the accuser's story that put three people in an unfavorable light] with the three friends. If the fact-checking department had understood that such a practice was unacceptable, the outcome would almost certainly have changed.  Confronting Subjects With Details. When [the reporter] sought comment, she missed the opportunity to hear challenging, detailed rebuttals from [the fraternity] before publication. The fact-checker relied only on [the reporter's] communications with the fraternity and did not independently confirm with Phi Kappa Psi the account Rolling Stone intended to publish. ... If both the reporter and checker had understood that by policy they should routinely share specific, derogatory details with the subjects of their reporting, Rolling Stone might have veered in a different direction.

Our Ethics Handbook deals with those points. Here is where NPR stands:

 Dont Create Pseudonyms For Sources Whose Names We Withhold. When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source. Again, our job is to present factual  not fabricated  information. Instead, we use pronouns and descriptions to make clear who is speaking or whom were referring to. (Or we may refer to him or her without using a last name, if the source is comfortable with that degree of anonymity, and the situation meets our standards for granting anonymity. ... )  No Attacks. In our coverage, anonymous or unnamed sources generally cannot make pejorative comments about the character, reputation, or personal qualities of another individual, or derogatory statements about an institution. ... [Exceptions are made only after] careful deliberation with senior news managers.  Give Sources Time To Respond. If our audience wonders what someone we report about had to say in his or her defense, and we havent provided that information or explained our efforts to get it, we have failed.  Give Subjects Enough Information To Be Able To Respond Effectively. In 2005, NPR aired a story about the new editor of the Paris Review. Former staffers of the magazine  some of whom had been let go  were heard saying that the new leader was betraying the vision of the Reviews founder, George Plimpton. What was the editors response to that charge? He didnt get the chance to say. Our interview with him was done before the critics were contacted, and the editor wasnt contacted again. NPR subsequently apologized on the air for not giving the editor the chance to answer his critics. As Bill Marimow, then-NPR vice president for news, said: If the subject of the story doesnt know what youre going to report, how can we be fair to them? 

CJRs analysis makes clear that several people are to blame for Rolling Stones failures, starting with the reporter and extending to her editors. So heres another reminder from our handbook:

Edit Like A Prosecutor. Great journalism comes in part from the collaborative efforts of reporters, editors and producers, who all play a key role in ensuring accuracy. We believe in teamwork. But good editors are also good prosecutors. They test, probe and challenge reporters, always with the goal of making NPRs stories as good (and therefore as accurate) as possible.

npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,More Than A Marketing Trend,[],"The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing Trend

Here's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books  and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again. Those books would be Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins. So let's explore why those two are so influential.

Crime novelist Megan Abbott and Sarah Weinman of the newsletter Publisher's Lunch stopped by to discuss the phenomenon with NPR's Steve Inskeep. ""I have talked to other crime writers that have been urged by various professional people in their life to put the world girl in their title,"" says Abbott. ""It's not necessarily an issue with the content of the book itself, but there's this sort of shorthand that if it has 'girl' in the title, then I know what to expect.""

That calculus seems to be at work with a book that arrived recently at NPR's offices: Girl in the Dark, by Marion Pauw, described by its publisher as ""in the vein of blockbuster thrillers such as The Girl on the Train and The Good Girl,"" by Mary Kubica.

""I think there's really something at the root of the popularity of Flynn's and Hawkins' books that is far more important than branding or marketing,"" Abbott says, ""and I think it's the universal themes that you see in these books that speak to female readers.""

Interview Highlights

On what they read growing up

Abbott: I grew up reading crime fiction mysteries, true crime  a lot of true crime  and it is traditionally a male dominated field from the outside, but from the inside what we know, those of us who read it, is that women buy the most crime fiction, they are by far the biggest readers of true crime, and there's a voracious appetite among women for these stories, and I know I feel it  since I was quite small I wanted to go to those dark places.

Weinman: I was a voracious true crime reader, I followed trials, I read the newspapers. And I also wanted to circle back a bit because you opened the segment with Girl in the Dark by Marion Pauw, which I have happened to have read, and it's a really excellent novel. Marion Pauw is from the Netherlands, and that book, which was published there several years ago as Daglicht, was a huge bestseller and in a way calling it Girl in the Dark doesn't tell you what it's all about because it's partly about wrongful conviction, it's partly about juggling motherhood. So in a way, the girl insignia is trying to tie it into this larger marketing purpose, but sometimes it can be a disservice. Perhaps it's a notion that suspense by women is part of a broader field and of course it's been happening for decades ... this is not a new phenomenon.

On what women's crime novels have in common

Abbott: I think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train are great because they're not that similar books at all, but they're both dealing with the sort of perils of being a woman today, of marriages falling apart, of ambivalence with motherhood, the complexities of relationships among women  all this stuff that in some ways isn't taken very seriously by the culture at large, is considered  and I'm quoting here  ""women's magazine fodder,"" but it's actually very real to readers.

Weinman: Just to chime in as well, both of those books, what they have in common, what I think a lot of these other books that have climbed upon the ""girl train"" so to speak is ... people are gravitating towards these unreliable narrators. I know that when I read Gone Girl it was 2012, we were only a few years removed from the economic crash of 2008, a lot of people felt their lives were completely upended, they didn't know who to trust, and so a book like Gone Girl, which gets at the heart of a marriage that seems to be stable but is anything but, I really think that did speak to people.

On whether they still love the kind of crime writing they grew up with

Abbott: Yes, I mean, I certainly have a more gimlet eye about the world of publishing ... but the books themselves  it feels like a really exciting moment in the genre just to be able to have these heroines who might be considered too unlikable, just to have them embraced just feels kind of thrilling.

We asked Abbott and Weinman to recommend some good thrillers by women  either out now or coming soon  and here are their picks:

Apple shareholders will be voting on a proposal at the annual meeting Feb. 26. It's a proposal that the company opposes, which calls for the tech leader to increase diversity in its senior management.

Antonio Maldonado owns more than $2,000 worth of stock in Apple and he's been pushing the company to increase what he calls an ""abysmal"" lack of diversity at the top level. In 2015, the company had one Hispanic and four African-American members among the 103 people Apple considers executives, senior officials and managers. Seventy-three of those top executives were white men.

""They believe that they're making a lot of progress and that their numbers are great in upper management. And [my belief] is actually quite the opposite,"" Maldonado told NPR's Michel Martin.

He says he first became interested in this issue while discussing tech careers with his son. ""We were reviewing the website for Apple. And he just made a quick quirp and just said 'Oh look at that, I'll be the first person of color up there.'

""That stuck in my mind, believe it or not,"" he says. ""And for three years I did some research and I started challenging Apple directly about this. And unfortunately, they never gave me sufficient answers as to why it was occurring, so I decided to come up with this.""

Maldonado's shareholder proposal requests ""that the board of directors adopt an accelerated recruitment policy,"" which would require Apple ""to increase the diversity of senior management and its Board of Directors, two bodies that presently fails to adequately represent diversity (particularly Hispanic, African-American, Native-American and other people of colour).""

Apple's board opposes the proposal. The company argues it ""is unduly burdensome and not necessary because Apple has demonstrated to shareholders its commitment to inclusion and diversity, which are core values for our company."" Company lawyers also said the proposal would ""micro-manage"" hiring decisions and that it was impossible to implement because it would ""require the candidates the Company recruits"" to accept job offers.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote that the company was ""committed to fostering and advancing inclusion and diversity across Apple and all the communities we're a part of."" At other levels besides the top suite, Apple's diversity improved slightly in 2015.

As part of diversity efforts, the company points to its move to provide scholarships to historically black colleges, donations of Apple products to schools as part of President Obama's ConnectED initiative, and sponsoring the 2015 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

At the top level, five of Apple's eight board members are white men. James A. Bell, the former president of Boeing who is African-American, was elected to the board in October 2015. Almost all of the 18 executives listed on Apple's website are white men. Two executives are African-American women.

""Unfortunately when they start pointing to something like that, it tends to be tokenism,"" Maldonado says of the two black executives. ""Let's just look at the facts. For instance, in the board of directors, it was a span of 18 years between having black members within the board of directors.""

Maldonado says the recent additions of women and African-Americans to the board and group of senior executives was the result of pressure from groups like the Rainbow PUSH coalition of Jesse Jackson. Jackson told Bloomberg last year that it's a small sign that ""Apple is moving in the right direction.""

But ""the company lags far behind Facebook, Google and Microsoft"" among diversity in senior management, according to Engadget.

Issues of diversity at Apple are reflective of the technology industry as a whole, which is dominated by white men. Activists have prodded tech firms to begin issuing regular diversity reports on their progress.

Maldonado's proposal is nonbinding. But ""it does nudge a company to actually act rightly. It's a black mark on their brand if they decide to go against something that the shareholders want,"" he says. ""After all, the company's owned by shareholders, not by individuals. So therefore they have to comply eventually to shareholders' requests. Even though it may not be today or tomorrow, eventually they have to.""

At least 25 board diversity resolutions were filed in 2015, according to the Thirty Percent Coalition, which supports having more women on company boards. Since 2000, 57 resolutions to increase diversity at publicly-traded companies have gone to a vote, though none have been approved, Edward Kamonjoh of Institutional Shareholder Services told Bloomberg.

""Our goal of course is to hopefully get this to pass,"" says Maldonado. And if it doesn't, he plans to bring it up again.","['shareholders', 'executives', 'diversity', 'apple', 'company', 'homogeneity', 'maldonado', 'apples', 'boardroom', 'senior', 'proposal', 'confronting', 'white', 'board']"
npr,,Theres No Need To Run Through Some Peoples Resumes On First Reference,[],"Theres No Need To Run Through Some Peoples Resumes On First Reference

Its been drilled into our heads that we should include at least a bit of a persons biography on first reference. So this guidance is a break from tradition. Here goes:

If someone is well-known, it will often feel and sound more natural to move that bio material to later in a Newscast spot, blog post or show piece. In some cases it may not even be necessary to include all the biographical information youre tempted to fold in.

For instance, rather than beginning with a reference to 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin or former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin or former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, simply slip one of those reminders in later.

In most cases, theres no need to remind the audience on first reference that Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state, former senator or former first lady. You may need to say Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, but there are more conversational ways to get that information across as well. For instance, by talking about Hillary Clintons campaign for the White House and getting the word Democratic in at another point.

Its unlikely you would start a conversation with a friend by saying Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. You would say Bernie Sanders. In many cases, we can do the same and let the references to his run for the Democratic nomination, the senate and Vermont come in naturally.

This guidance is mostly about politicians, but can apply to others as well. Former Beatle doesnt always have to go in front of Paul McCartney. Oprah Winfrey can stand on her own for a line or two. Boxer Muhammad Ali may not be necessary on first reference.

Heres the takeaway: We dont have to be bound to the notion that first references must be mini resumes. Use your judgment.

Related notes:

 This does not change the way we refer to sitting presidents, vice presidents and other world leaders. Were sticking with formalities on first references to them.

 Party IDs are key information in stories about policy makers and politicians. If you dont include an R, a D, a Democrat or a Republican, you will hear from readers and listeners who say youre trying to hide someones affiliation.

 If the news is about legislation thats being introduced, a hearing thats being held, results of an investigation that are being released or other official business, we stick with tradition. It would be Sen. Jane Doe or Attorney Gen. John Doe on first reference.

 It should always be Conqueror of the Unpronounceable Word Korva Coleman on first reference.

Journalist Susan Jacoby tells Fresh Air that more than half of Americans will change religion at least once in their adult life time. Her new book is Strange Gods: A Secular History of Conversion.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Susan Jacoby, is an atheist, but members of three generations of her family were converts from one religion to another. Her father was a secular Jew who converted to his wife's religion, Catholicism, several years after they were married. Susan didn't even know her father was from a Jewish family until she was a teenager. She wrote a memoir about her family's buried past about seventeen years ago. She's also the author of a book about the history of American secularism. Now she's written a new book, called, ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" She also recently wrote an op-ed piece for The New York Times about how the population of nonreligious Americans, including atheists and agnostics, is at an all-time high this election year, yet political campaigns typically ignore the growing number of secular voters.

Susan Jacoby, welcome to FRESH AIR. So why did you write a book about the history of conversion? Now, I know some of the answer to that has to do with the history of conversion in your own family - which we'll get to in a bit - and some of it has to do with the fact that you are an atheist - which we'll also get to in a little bit - but, just historically, what did you want to know?

SUSAN JACOBY: I wanted to know how much of conversion was forced - that is, forced in the sense that the Inquisition forced people to choose - forced Jews, let's say, and Muslims to choose conversion to Christianity or death. I wanted to see how much of conversion historically was forced in that way and how much of it was really a kind of persuasion. Whether through intermarriage, which is the most common reason for conversion historically, or the desire to gain social advantages, economic advantages, jobs which are closed to one person rather than another if the person is a member of a minority religion. I wanted to find out what are the things - apart from the blinding flash on the road to Damascus, the light that comes out of the sky, the voice of God - I wanted to find out what are the earthly forces? Politics, economics, imperialism, slavery. In other words, to look at conversion as more than a spiritual journey but also as a material earthly journey in this material world.

GROSS: So in keeping with what you've been talking about - about how there many different kinds of conversions, many different reasons for conversion, some of the mass conversions that you write about were really a part of imperialism. You conquer the territory and you change the people's religions to the religion of your state.

JACOBY: Of course, and the biggest religious wars and persecutions in history occur when religions, each claiming their own absolute truths, come into conflict. If during the Reformation you were a Catholic who lived in a part of Germany in which Lutheranism was the ascendant religion and the ruler of the province or the region was Lutheran, to stay a Catholic, you either had to be a dissenter or you had to leave. And one of the reasons there are largely Catholic and largely Protestant regions of Germany today is that people did sort themselves out geographically. So not only imperialism in the sense of conquering other peoples but also theocracy in the sense of - in the sense of churches, you know, having a very close relationship if not an absolute union with the state.

GROSS: And talking about religion and comparing America to other parts of the world, you write about how, you know, conversions, interfaith marriages, are much more common in the U.S. than in most other places in the world in part because there has been no state religion here. People have been free to choose their religion and free to change their religion if they want to, and many people have taken advantage of that freedom. Do you want to elaborate that - on that a little bit?

JACOBY: Yes. I think very few people realize how much the separation of church and state has to do with the fact that Americans are not only more religious than a lot of other people in the world but that conversions are much more common here. More than half of Americans have changed religions at least once in their adult lifetime. This is - the rate of religious conversion here is much, much higher than it is anywhere in Europe, for example. People there tend - if they don't practice the default religion, they often slide into secularism, but it's not a conversion in the sense of you don't find very many Lutherans converting to Catholicism or Judaism in Sweden, for example. But you do find all sorts of people converting to all sorts of religions here. Now, part of that is our secular constitution in which - for so long in Europe before the 20th century, before the middle of the 20th century, a decision about religion was also a decision about politics. In other words, if you chose a particular religion, you were siding with the government religion of whatever region you were in. That's never been true in America, but also, the United States also has so many more immigrant groups which also tends to imply more religious diversity right away.

GROSS: Islam and Christianity have long histories of conversion. Judaism doesn't. It's a religion where you're born into it. And conversion to Judaism, I think it's really only in modern times that that's even been accepted, and I'm not sure it's still accepted by all branches of Judaism.

JACOBY: No, Terry. I'm going to correct you on that. People think that, that conversion to Judaism is just a modern phenomenon. But there was an era in the late Roman Empire Judaism was not a proselytizing religion. It didn't go out looking for converts, but it accepted converts. And one of the interesting things is is that Judaism was very attractive to the Roman aristocracy. Now most of the conversions that actually occurred were probably the result of mixed marriages of Roman women marrying into Jewish families. But it isn't true that there weren't conversions to Judaism then. As I said, they didn't proselytize, but they accepted and in that respect, not so different from conversions to Judaism resulting from mixed marriages today. The Roman Empire was fairly tolerant of religious choice as long as you made a point not of thumbing your nose in public at the Roman gods.

GROSS: So why was conversion accepted then but not after?

JACOBY: Well, very simple, the Christian church became ascendant in the Roman Empire. The Roman emperors became Christians. Constantine was the first, of course, but soon afterwards. And once the Roman Catholic Church in the West became the church most closely connected with the state, the Roman Catholic Church did not recognize the validity of any religion other than its own. So that it was not only Jews were a thorn in their side because Jews in general refuse to convert, but pagans converted and masked to Christianity. It was the thing to do. If you were ambitious, if you wanted to get along, that's what happened, not so different from anything else. But the short answer is that the Christian religion did not tolerate heresy.

GROSS: When you were in Catholic school, the most famous conversion story that you were taught was the story of Saul on the road to Damascus. What did that story mean to you?

JACOBY: (Laughter) Well, the funny thing was is they tried to teach it, and - but they didn't place much stress on the fact that Saul was originally a Jew, although, he had to have been, that Saul had been a persecutor of Jesus, a persecutor of Christians. And he had seen the light on the road to Damascus was what we were told, that he realized he'd been wrong to oppose Christianity. But the nuns were very vague about what it was he was opposing Christianity from. I assure you, we weren't taught at St. Thomas Aquinas School a kind of theology of Jesus the Jew in which you're taught at a good religious university today. So that - what the story of Saul just meant to me was this man who had hated Jesus, but exactly why he hated Jesus and Christians wasn't made all that clear. You know, he just - he fell off his horse, and God spoke to him, and, you know, he straightened up and flew right.

GROSS: So in writing about the history of conversion, you write about your family's history of conversion as well. Can you just give us an overview of the three generations of converts in your family?

JACOBY: Yes, my family is a genuinely American story. My great-grandparents came over from - my great-grandfather came over from Germany after the revolution of - unfailed revolutions of 1848. They remained Jews, he and his wife, but their children - they had three children - one of them married a German baron and went back to Germany and converted to Lutheranism to marry the German baron. One of them, my great uncle Harold, who was professor of astronomy at Columbia University in the first part of the century at a time when there weren't very many Jewish-tenured professors, but he also wasn't a Jew by then. He married an Episcopalian and converted to the Episcopal Church, which was a fairly common thing for German Jews who converted and were moving up on the social ladder. His story is exemplified by the fact that his real name is Levi Harold Jacoby. He's still Levi Harold in the freshman class book at Columbia, but he becomes just plain Harold when he becomes a professor. He's a well-known popularizer of science. My grandfather, Oswald, did not convert and, in fact, married a Jew, but they were completely nonobservant. And they sent their children to Lutheran Sunday schools in Brooklyn. The kicker ending to all of this is that my father and his two siblings all married Irish Catholics and eventually converted.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Susan Jacoby. She's the author of the new book ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" She's also the author of a memoir about conversions in her own family and author of the book ""Freethinkers: A History Of American Secularism."" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Susan Jacoby. She's the author of the new book ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" She wrote an earlier book that's a memoir about the history of conversions in her own family. And she's the author of ""Freethinkers: A History Of American Secularism.""

So in keeping with the theme of conversion in your family, your father was a secular Jew. Your mother was Irish Catholic.

JACOBY: Yes, that's right.

GROSS: But her mother - your maternal grandmother - was brought up Lutheran and converted to Catholicism because your grandfather was Catholic. Do I have that right?

JACOBY: Yes.

GROSS: OK. So there was - so what was your grandmother's reaction - being a convert herself - to her daughter marrying a Jewish man?

JACOBY: She was completely approving. And she even told my father that it was perfectly all right with them whether he converted to Catholicism or not. Eventually, he did convert seven years later, but not because of any pressure from my grandparents. And my grandfather, who was an Irish Catholic - my mother's father - he also was very favorable toward the marriage because he believed stereotypically that Jewish men make good husbands because they don't drink and they don't beat their wives. He was very happy and this happiness, since everyone is now dead, I can say was due partly to the fact that my mother had a first marriage to a Catholic alcoholic, which was annulled. So my father - my grandfather was thrilled that she was marrying someone he considered a sober and abstemious Jew (laughter).

GROSS: Funny thing, though, your father ended up being a gambler - having a gambling problem.

JACOBY: Well, my grandfather didn't know that (laughter) at the time. And indeed my father - one of the reasons for his conversion was he had a terrible gambling problem, and my mother was going to leave him if he didn't get control of it. He thought since he knew nothing about Judaism - he'd been brought up in a completely nonreligious Jewish home - he thought just practicing a religion might help him overcome his gambling problem.

And this too is a theme in so many conversions, whether it's alcoholism or gambling, the desire to overcome some personal fault which the person feels he or she cannot do on his or her own. Look, President George W. Bush is a born-again Christian, which I do consider a conversion, and I should say that I define a true conversion as any conversion that requires a real change in the way someone lives.

And so my father's conversion was sincere, even though he didn't believe all of the technical points of Catholic doctrine, just as I'm sure George W. Bush's conversion helped him overcome his problems with drink. And this is a theme in so many conversions that just transcends any individual or any family.

GROSS: Your father converted when you were 7, but you didn't find out that he'd converted from Judaism to Catholicism until considerably later in your life. When he told you that he'd converted, what he first told you was it was just kind of more of a family thing, that that way the whole family could go to church and then the whole family could go out for breakfast afterwards.

JACOBY: Right. That was absolutely it.

GROSS: So was that just a cover story?

JACOBY: Yeah. Well, what was really weird was he said he'd converted from Episcopalianism (ph) (laughter). And by the way, I live in...

GROSS: Oh, because he hadn't told you yet that he was Jewish. He was still hiding that from you.

JACOBY: No, no, he was still hiding that.

GROSS: So how did you find out your father was Jewish?

JACOBY: Oh, I asked him when I was about 17 or 18. I said, you know, Dad, I think that our family must be Jewish. I'd met the relatives in New York and, you know, I'd learned about their history, and there was also just this sort of big gaping hole in all of the stories about how they got there. My Aunt Edith was also a Catholic convert, and my Uncle Ozzie, who was a famous Oslo Jacoby - a famous bridge champion - was another - a sibling of my dad's who's a Catholic convert. And I just figured it out, and I said, Dad, I think your family must have been Jewish and he said it was.

And I said, why didn't you tell my brother and me? And he said - and this is a voice out of a different America. He said - and this would be, you know, around 1963 - he said, I didn't want you and your brother to think if you didn't get anything you wanted in life it was because you were Jewish. Isn't that sad? And it speaks back to a different America which had a different attitude about minorities and to pain from childhood. Later, I learned about a lot of things that he was beaten up and called all of the epithets that people call Jews if they're anti-Semites. And he just wanted to erase that part of his past.

GROSS: You know how you said your father converted primarily because he wanted to give up his gambling problem and he knew if he didn't he'd basically lose his family...

JACOBY: Yes.

GROSS: ...And so he needed help and he thought, you know, converting to Catholicism would help him. And, as you point out, that's a reason why a lot of people convert because they need - they need to feel that there's a power greater than themselves that can guide them and help them and also that there's, like, a discipline that will help them.

JACOBY: Yes.

GROSS: Did it help him? Did the conversion help him give up gambling?

JACOBY: I think it did. I actually think it did. For one thing, the Catholic Church in particular has this one thing - confession - in which you could go, confess to a priest and obtain absolution of your sins. And there was a routine and a ritual and I think - I think that it did help him, yes.

GROSS: And did that affect your view of faith when you found that out?

JACOBY: No. I'd be the last person in the world to deny that there are many people for whom faith is - can be a great sustaining force. You know, people often wrongly think that atheists want to convert other people to atheism (laughter). I am completely uninterested in that. And atheism, by the way, is not a religion. One of the things, in fact, that atheism lacks are the kinds of rituals that religion does provide and I would be the first to say that.

I don't, for example, ever participate in debates about the existence or nonexistence of God because I can't imagine why anyone would be persuaded one way or the other by such things. And so I don't deny that religion is very healthful to a lot of people. And as long as they don't try to convert me, I have, you know, nothing - and to interfere with the rights of people to believe other religions or to not believe in any religion at all - as long as they mind their own religion - perfectly all right with me, in the case of my father, as well as any other religious convert I know.

GROSS: My guest is Susan Jacoby. Her new book is called ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" After we take a short break, she'll tell us why she doesn't like it when political speeches end with the statement God bless America. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Susan Jacoby, author of the new book, ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" One of her earlier books is a memoir about the history of religious conversions in three generations of her own family. Jacoby is also the author of ""A History Of American Secularism."" She describes herself as an atheist.

You wrote a recent op-ed in The New York Times that was headlined, ""Sick And Tired Of God Bless America,"" and this was about how you were tired of hearing political speeches end with God Bless America. What's your problem with that?

JACOBY: They didn't used to, you know. God Bless America started to become an almost ritualistic incantation at the end of political speeches really with Ronald Reagan. It appears occasionally before, but it was not that common. And of course since it was a song that wasn't written by Irving Berlin until the 20th century (laughter), none of the 19th century presidents said God Bless America at the end of speeches, either. I think that the symbolism which suggests that everybody is religious and that even presidents who believe in church and state feel obliged to do this...

GROSS: Believe in the separation of church and state.

JACOBY: Who believe in the separation of church and state feel obliged to do this. And not only, some presidents are more careful than others to make it an inclusive God, but there is also plain talk about Jesus, as we've heard in the campaign recently. It's not simply God they're talking about, it's a particular kind of God, and also I think a longing for a more Christian America.

GROSS: I assume you've been following the Democratic and Republican primary campaigns. Are there statements you've heard candidates make pertaining to religion that you have found troubling in a multicultural country that includes a lot of people like you, who are secular?

JACOBY: The most troubling statement is, is that - made by Ted Cruz - which is, nobody should be president who doesn't begin his day on his knees. I find that what he's saying is no nonreligious person has the right to be president of the United States. I find that deeply troubling. I find it troubling that religious people don't find it troubling. You know, a person can be religious and still respect secular values and not talk about Jesus all the time as though every American believed in Jesus. President Jimmy Carter is a very good example of that. A devout Baptist, he left the Southern Baptist convention in which he was raised because of disagreements among other things with its views about women, but he's still a devout Baptist in his own way. But who, by the way, in the tradition of the first Baptists who joined with freethinkers to ratify a constitution that makes no mention of God, Jimmy Carter is that kind of Baptist. That kind of religious person who respects not only other religions but secular people is fine, but the kind of person who talks on the campaign trail as if to be a decent person or a decent public official, you have to have deep faith in God and practice a religion and that there's something second-class about people who don't, that is deeply troubling to me.

GROSS: Bernie Sanders is interesting in terms of what we've been talking about because he's Jewish and, you know, if he was elected, he would be the first Jewish president, but he's also secular. As far as I know, he's either not or not very observant, and presidential candidates tend to not talk about being secular very much. They tend to talk more about their religious biography - at least nowadays. So what are some of your observations about how religion is being addressed or not addressed in the Sanders campaign?

JACOBY: While Bernie Sanders is not known to belong to a synagogue, he has consistently, throughout his career, kind of avoided questions like that. And in fact, has done so in this campaign. When Jimmy Kimmel asked him whether he believed in God, he came out with something very unlike his usual statements in which he talked about his spirituality and how we're all in this together. He didn't answer the question of whether he believed in God or not. So even Bernie Sanders, who is probably the most secular candidate - or, openly secular. I should say openly secular - we've ever had, is not about to go there. Now, I don't see why any president has to talk about his belief in God.

GROSS: So we've talked about how you are secular, how you are an atheist. But you write, if I believed in any God, it would be the God of the Jews, if I could be consoled by any prayer, it would be the Kaddish. The Kaddish is the prayer for the dead in the Jewish religion. So why do you say that, that if you were religious, it would be Judaism that you'd turn to?

JACOBY: I wrote that almost 17 years ago now. I think that was a rare occasion of my being sentimental. I feel Jewish in the sense of culturally Jewish, I suppose the way Bernie Sanders feels Jewish, but not Jewish in a religious sense. And I would say that I wouldn't write that sentence today. I don't consider this a flip-flop, by the way. I simply think that I'm looking at religion now less through the eyes of a daughter who loved her father very much and felt terribly sorry that he grew up ashamed of being Jewish, and I think that's what those words came out of. But in truth, I no more believe in the God of the Jews than I believe in any God.

GROSS: Why do you feel that you are culturally Jewish? Since your mother was Catholic, your father denied his Judaism and then converted to Catholicism, you didn't even find out he was Jewish until you were in your teens. So in what sense do you feel like you were culturally Jewish since you were so not exposed to Judaism? You grew up in a town where there were very few Jews.

JACOBY: Yes, but I moved to New York and have spent the last 44 years of my adult life in New York, and I am very interested - as you know in my new book, I spend a lot of time talking about why Jews and their stubborn attachment to their religion, even when they weren't religious Jews, posed a - something that European culture felt obliged to reject. And particularly, I am attached to the better part of the American Jewish story and wish that my father had been able to see his Jewish heritage as a positive thing rather than as the negative thing he always saw it was. So I would say that I feel culturally Jewish because of the way that I have lived my adult life, and I do know a lot about Judaism now, but I wouldn't write that sentence again because I think my non-belief in God has only grown stronger over the years. And I did say if I could be consoled any God. I still do find the prayers of the Kaddish quite moving, and I just substitute in my mind nature, although that's what the founders did in a lot of their documents, too. They substituted nature or providence for God. I think that's what I do in my head with Jewish God.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Susan Jacoby. Her new book is called ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" She's also the author of a memoir called ""Half-Jew"" about the history of conversion in her own family, and she's the author of ""Freethinkers: A History Of American Secularism."" Let's take a short break here then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Susan Jacoby. She's the author of the new book ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" Her memoir, ""Half-Jew,"" which was published several years ago, is about conversion in her own family. And she's also the author of ""Freethinkers: A History Of American Secularism.""

Your second husband had Alzheimer's and he died about eight years ago.

JACOBY: He wasn't my husband.

GROSS: Oh, he wasn't your husband.

JACOBY: No.

GROSS: OK, so your partner.

JACOBY: Yes.

GROSS: Your partner, did he practice any religion, if you don't mind my asking?

JACOBY: No.

GROSS: No.

JACOBY: No, and actually, you know, when we were talking about conversions, this is one thing I don't understand. I don't have any children, but if I did - and I know that many people in mixed marriages have to negotiate this - but I believe that whether one believes in God or not is - it's very central to who I am. I actually cannot imagine raising children or doing the things you do - other things you do with a partner who disagreed with me on something so fundamental. To me, it's fundamental. I completely can't understand people, for example, of different faiths who say that their children will choose when they grow up. I think that if you believe in a religion, most people believe that it's right.

If you believe in what I do, which is secular humanism, I would find it extremely difficult to live with someone - not to love someone - but to live with somebody and build a life of someone who disagreed with me on something so fundamental. And when my partner was dying of Alzheimer's, we discussed this. And he said, you know - you know, after I die you'll be the only custodian of our memories, meaning he believed as I do, that death is the end. There's no solace for us in the idea of life after death because we didn't believe in it.

I cannot imagine a long relationship with anyone who didn't agree with me on something so fundamental. And again, I'm not in any way saying that religious people are wrong about this. I'm saying that I think people who love each other and live together and have children together need to agree on the things that are most important in life. I cannot imagine, for example, being married to a devout Catholic or an Orthodox Jew.

GROSS: OK. And that sense of being on the same page is part of why people in your family converted when they got married or after they got married.

JACOBY: Yes.

GROSS: So if you fell in love - this is a hypothetical - if you fell in love with somebody who practiced a faith, would you want them to convert (laughter) to atheism?

JACOBY: Well, of course not. I can't imagine falling in love with a devoutly religious person. Now, that - I will fully acknowledge many people could call that a failure of imagination on my part, but it is important to me. To me, it would be like falling in love with someone who thinks a woman's place is in the home, and I know that women have fallen in love with men like that. But it's something fundamental to me, human rights that people are equal under law simply because they are human beings. And I can no more imagine falling in love with someone who believed, for instance, as Orthodox Jews do, that women are unclean during their menstrual periods. I can no more imagine falling in love with someone who believed that than I can imagine falling in love with someone who believes that blacks shouldn't be able to vote and are inferior to whites.

GROSS: It seems to me in some ways you are more committed to secularism and atheism than some Christians and Jews and Muslims are committed to their faith in the sense that there's a lot of Christians and Jews for sure who are just kind of, like, nominally Christians and Jews. Like, they identify it - they identify themselves that way. Maybe they go to synagogue. Maybe they go to church.

JACOBY: High holidays.

GROSS: High holidays, yeah. But it doesn't strictly define their world view or their day-to-day life.

JACOBY: My atheism doesn't define my day-to-day life at all. But I realize - and maybe it is because, unlike people who sort of stay comfortably in a religion, I had to do a lot of thinking and reading before I realized that I was an atheist. But it's not that I'm committed to it, please understand, in the sense of wanting to spread it. In other words, I don't think by saying that I would find it difficult to build a life with someone who didn't share my beliefs about this, I'm not saying that I think atheists are better than other people. God, no. What I am saying is I do feel that this an integral part of who I am. And it's not something that I could comfortably think of not sharing with the person I loved most in the world.

GROSS: In the years that you've been writing about atheism, has the reaction that you've gotten changed?

JACOBY: There's more positive reaction than there was at first, which I think is a reflection of the changing population of the United States. There are, of course, many critical things and some of them are very interesting and very respectful criticisms. I have received many touching letters and emails from people who live in the most religious parts of the country, in places like rural Texas, saying it is so good to see someone be able to say I am an atheist without shame.

I have never been able to say that in my community, one woman wrote, because my children would be bullied in school. And these things touch me that they make people like that feel less alone. But I also thinks it's a grave reflection on our country that someone wouldn't be able to say that they're an atheist, if they are, when asked the question what church do you go to because they're afraid their children would be beaten up in school. That's as bad as my father being called anti-Jewish epithets in Brooklyn in 1916, in 1917, in 1918.

GROSS: Susan Jacoby, thank you so much for talking with us.

JACOBY: Thank you. It's been wonderful.

GROSS: Susan Jacoby is the author of the new book ""Strange Gods: A Secular History Of Conversion."" After we take a short break, Lloyd Schwartz will review the album that just won the Grammy for best opera recording. This is FRESH AIR.

npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,More Than A Marketing Trend,[],"The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing Trend

Here's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books  and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again. Those books would be Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins. So let's explore why those two are so influential.

Crime novelist Megan Abbott and Sarah Weinman of the newsletter Publisher's Lunch stopped by to discuss the phenomenon with NPR's Steve Inskeep. ""I have talked to other crime writers that have been urged by various professional people in their life to put the world girl in their title,"" says Abbott. ""It's not necessarily an issue with the content of the book itself, but there's this sort of shorthand that if it has 'girl' in the title, then I know what to expect.""

That calculus seems to be at work with a book that arrived recently at NPR's offices: Girl in the Dark, by Marion Pauw, described by its publisher as ""in the vein of blockbuster thrillers such as The Girl on the Train and The Good Girl,"" by Mary Kubica.

""I think there's really something at the root of the popularity of Flynn's and Hawkins' books that is far more important than branding or marketing,"" Abbott says, ""and I think it's the universal themes that you see in these books that speak to female readers.""

Interview Highlights

On what they read growing up

Abbott: I grew up reading crime fiction mysteries, true crime  a lot of true crime  and it is traditionally a male dominated field from the outside, but from the inside what we know, those of us who read it, is that women buy the most crime fiction, they are by far the biggest readers of true crime, and there's a voracious appetite among women for these stories, and I know I feel it  since I was quite small I wanted to go to those dark places.

Weinman: I was a voracious true crime reader, I followed trials, I read the newspapers. And I also wanted to circle back a bit because you opened the segment with Girl in the Dark by Marion Pauw, which I have happened to have read, and it's a really excellent novel. Marion Pauw is from the Netherlands, and that book, which was published there several years ago as Daglicht, was a huge bestseller and in a way calling it Girl in the Dark doesn't tell you what it's all about because it's partly about wrongful conviction, it's partly about juggling motherhood. So in a way, the girl insignia is trying to tie it into this larger marketing purpose, but sometimes it can be a disservice. Perhaps it's a notion that suspense by women is part of a broader field and of course it's been happening for decades ... this is not a new phenomenon.

On what women's crime novels have in common

Abbott: I think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train are great because they're not that similar books at all, but they're both dealing with the sort of perils of being a woman today, of marriages falling apart, of ambivalence with motherhood, the complexities of relationships among women  all this stuff that in some ways isn't taken very seriously by the culture at large, is considered  and I'm quoting here  ""women's magazine fodder,"" but it's actually very real to readers.

Weinman: Just to chime in as well, both of those books, what they have in common, what I think a lot of these other books that have climbed upon the ""girl train"" so to speak is ... people are gravitating towards these unreliable narrators. I know that when I read Gone Girl it was 2012, we were only a few years removed from the economic crash of 2008, a lot of people felt their lives were completely upended, they didn't know who to trust, and so a book like Gone Girl, which gets at the heart of a marriage that seems to be stable but is anything but, I really think that did speak to people.

On whether they still love the kind of crime writing they grew up with

Abbott: Yes, I mean, I certainly have a more gimlet eye about the world of publishing ... but the books themselves  it feels like a really exciting moment in the genre just to be able to have these heroines who might be considered too unlikable, just to have them embraced just feels kind of thrilling.

We asked Abbott and Weinman to recommend some good thrillers by women  either out now or coming soon  and here are their picks:

When most people hear about NPR's Book Your Trip series (about transit-themed summer reading) they suggest book titles. But when movie critic Bob Mondello heard about it, he started humming show tunes. And that's what you'll be doing too, after you listen to this story about ""trip"" musicals  shows that transport you by car, boat, train, plane or surrey with a fringe on top. Click the listen link at the top of this page, and then watch the musical numbers below. Enjoy the journey!

In Funny Girl, Barbra Streisand sings ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" on a train, in a taxi, and on a tugboat. She's taking off in a plane in ""Let's Hear it For Me"" from Funny Lady. And in ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" from Hello, Dolly!, she's on a train calling ""All aboard! All aboard!"" YouTube

Streisand sings ""A Piece of Sky"" from the deck of an oceanliner at the end of Yentl. YouTube

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley as Judy Garland sings to fellow passengers in Meet Me in St. Louis. YouTube

Garland takes a ride ""On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe"" in The Harvey Girls. YouTube

Garland and Fred Astaire tap out a train-themed ""When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabama"" in Easter Parade. YouTube

In the opening number of The Music Man propulsion is built into the lyrics; a train full of salesmen talk business and their words mimic the rattle and clatter of the tracks. YouTube

""Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry"" when Gordon MacRae sings ""The Surrey with the Fringe on Top"" with Shirley Jones in Oklahoma! YouTube

""Greased Lightning"" burns up the quarter mile in this four-wheel homage in Grease. YouTube

Most of the musical Show Boat takes place on a Mississippi paddle-wheeler. YouTube

W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore takes place aboard a British ship. YouTube

On the Twentieth Century is set on a 1930s train that raced between Chicago and Manhattan. This number is perhaps the ultimate traveling song: It doesn't change tempo, it doesn't have a chorus, it propels you forward, and it (seemingly) never ever, ever ends. YouTube

We couldn't possibly fit all the travel-themed show tunes into six minutes. We hope you'll leave your favorites in the comment section below.","['trolley', 'surrey', 'takes', 'sings', 'youtubegarland', 'century', 'train', 'musicals', 'tunes', 'youll', 'boat', 'aboard']"
npr,,Theyre Separatist Fighters And Their Russian Allies,[],"Theyre Separatist Fighters And Their Russian Allies

From Chuck Holmes:

Please use separatist fighters and their Russian allies to describe the anti-government forces in eastern Ukraine. Using separatist fighters alone could suggest that only locals are involved.

Kevin Beesley and Corey Flintoff offer the following guidance:

Pro-Russian Separatists could mislead our audience into thinking that most of the fighting is being done by local fighters. There is a lot of evidence that most, though not all, of the anti-government forces involved are Russian citizens  although Russia denies its military is directly involved. So weve come up with another construction that we think more accurately reflects the situation on the ground: Separatist fighters and their Russian allies. As in: After weeks of heavy fighting, a strategic town in eastern Ukraine has fallen to separatist fighters and their Russian allies.

Victims of a shooting spree are being mourned in Kalamazoo, Mich., where Jason Dalton, the man suspected of killing six people Saturday, is expected to be arraigned Monday. Police have been trying to determine a motive for what seem to be random attacks.

Eerie details have emerged about the case  including a witness's account of getting an Uber ride from Dalton, 45, who was a driver for the ride-hailing service. The witness tells NPR that he rode with Dalton shortly before the suspect was arrested in the center of town  and that they briefly discussed the shootings.

""Dalton was driving for Uber that night and stopped after midnight to pick up Derek  who asked NPR to only use his middle name because he's afraid of retribution from speaking about his encounter,"" NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports.

That encounter occurred after midnight, more than six hours after the first of three shootings  and during a manhunt that had police on the lookout for a Chevrolet like Dalton's.

Here's what Derek told Hansi:

""I jokingly said to the driver, 'You aren't the shooter, are you?' and he either shook his head or said no, and I said, 'Are you sure?' ""And his response wasn't like you would expect, like a laugh. It was just very calm and quiet. It was, 'I'm just tired. No, I'm just tired.' ""

Dalton was arrested about a half-hour later, Hansi reports. On Sunday, Uber confirmed that Dalton was a driver and had passed the company's background check. Police have said he did not have a criminal record.

Michigan State Police believe Dalton is the man who fired around 10 shots outside an apartment complex around 5:42 p.m. ET, wounding a woman who is now listed as being in serious condition.

That woman, whose name hasn't been released, is ""a hero,"" Kalamazoo Sheriff Richard Fuller tells local TV news WWMT. Explaining that she was in an area where several children were when the shooting started, Fuller says, ""This person put themselves between the children and the shooter, right away.""

The violence continued more than four hours later, when a father and son  Richard Eugene Smith, 53, and Tyler Daniel Smith, 17, both from Kalamazoo  were shot and killed at the Seelye Ford Kia car dealership.

That shooting was reported at 10:08 p.m. Minutes later, the third shooting was reported, at a parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant. That's where police say four women were killed after two vehicles  a Chevrolet Cruze and an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan  were fired upon.

State police released the names of those victims Sunday:

Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Mich. (driver of Oldsmobile minivan);

Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, Mich. (driver of Chevrolet);

Dorothy Brown, 74, of Battle Creek, Mich. (rear driver-side passenger of Chevrolet);

Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, Mich. (rear passenger-side passenger of Chevrolet).

A 14-year-old girl who was a passenger in the Chevrolet survived the shooting and was listed in critical condition late Sunday.

Prayer vigils and remembrances were held for the victims last night. Gov. Rick Snyder has ordered Michigan's state buildings to fly the state and U.S. flags at half-staff for the next six days, to honor each of the six who died.","['uber', 'passenger', 'suspects', 'later', 'ride', 'shooter', 'driver', 'arrest', 'state', 'arent', 'dalton', 'mich', 'kalamazoo', 'shooting', 'twoway', 'came', 'npr']"

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:

Harper Lee's longtime friend Wayne Flynt will be delivering the eulogy at her funeral. He joins us on the line from Monroeville. Welcome, Mr. Flynt, and I'm so sorry for your and I guess all of our loss.

WAYNE FLYNT: Yeah, I think it's a sort of global loss, given the popularity of the novel across the world.

WERTHEIMER: Can you give us a sense about your friendship with Harper Lee? You have been in very close contact with her in the last years of her life.

FLYNT: That's correct. On average, once a month for the last 10 years since her stroke, we have sat and talked and told stories and exchanged insults...

(LAUGHTER)

FLYNT: ...Which she loves. I think one secret to our friendship was I did not treat her like a marble woman, and my wife - I joked with her, and I joked with her, and that was the sort of contours of our friendship.

WERTHEIMER: What's been on her mind, do you think, at - toward the end of her life? What was on her mind?

FLYNT: I would say what was always on her mind was the stories she had to tell, and the story was pretty obvious in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" maybe a bit - little bit less obvious and more obscure in ""Go Set A Watchman.""

WERTHEIMER: Which was a new - an unpublished book, which was just published recently.

FLYNT: Yes, that's right. It was actually her first book, but people can't get their heads around the fact that the central story she wanted to tell was the story of ""Go Set A Watchman."" And then when her editor and her agent tells America, who's not quite ready for that story, and I'm not sure America is ready for that story in 2016, as a matter of fact. She recast this story and the brilliant characterizations of the three children into a different book, and that became ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""

WERTHEIMER: There's been so much written about Harper Lee, and one of the things that you read over and over again is that she was famously reclusive. Is there something about her that we may not know and you think we ought to know?

FLYNT: Yes, she was legendarily private. I've never known such a private woman in my life. It's no surprise that she left Monroeville, a gossipy little southern town where everybody wants to know everybody's business, and went to the most anonymous city in America.

WERTHEIMER: New York City.

FLYNT: And she loved New York City. She gloried in being able to go to Broadway and people not recognize her, eating out and not having people come up to the table to remind her that their grandmother had been in school with her (laughter). She felt this world down here was a claustrophobic world.

WERTHEIMER: Do think that Ms. Lee took great satisfaction in knowing that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" really deeply affected many generations of Americans, it was read by millions of students?

FLYNT: Oh, yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I constantly tell audiences all over the world that the single greatest icon of American culture from the publication of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was that novel so that if we say, what conversation can we have that would lead us on a road of tolerance, and teachers have decided that if you're going to teach values in a school in America, the answer that American teachers at all kinds of schools have come up with, just let Harper Lee teach ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" And then all the teacher has to do is stand back and guide the discussion.

WERTHEIMER: Wayne Flynt will deliver the eulogy at Harper Lee's funeral. Mr. Flynt, thank you very much for speaking with us and again, so sorry that you've lost such a good friend.

FLYNT: Yes, and so is the world.

When Jeb Bush suspended his bid for the GOP nomination, it brought to a close a chapter in American politics that has lasted nearly four decades. A period when the Bush family played a major role influencing the course of the country.

The combined Bush family political stats just going back to 1980 are beyond impressive.

Two presidents.

One vice president.

Two governors.

Seven national campaigns.

And there were lots of victories, but unfortunately for Jeb Bush, the most recent one won't be going in the win column. It wrapped up among loyal, but sad supporters in a hotel ballroom in Columbia, S.C.

As Jeb Bush began his primary night remarks on Saturday, it soon became clear he was bearing bad news. He would finish fourth place at best-in-the-state GOP contest. Not good enough to justify continuing.

""The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken,"" he said. Then, occasionally choking back tears, he added, ""So tonight I am suspending my campaign.""

But let's start this journey almost exactly 36 years earlier. It was January of 1980, and the Iowa caucuses were fast approaching.

Among the six candidates on stage were Sens. Howard Baker and Robert Dole, and former ambassador to China and the United Nations, former CIA chief, former congressman and former Republican Party Chairman George H.W. Bush. Skipping the debate was Ronald Reagan.

It was Bush's first presidential run and he declared, ""I want to be a part of the answer, not a part of the problem and that's why I need your help as we go into these Iowa caucuses on January 21st.""

He was well received in the auditorium that night, and on caucus day. George Bush would score a surprise victory, narrowly beating out Reagan. That strong showing was a big reason he became Reagan's running mate.

Eight years later, it was Bush's turn. He won the nomination and beat Democrat Michael Dukakis to win the White House.

During the 1988 Republican Convention, Bush spoke modestly of his military service as a Navy pilot in World War II.

""I say it without boast or bravado. I fought for my country. I've served.""

But his most famous line of that speech was this pledge, ""Read my lips. No new taxes.""

The applause was deafening, but it was a promise Bush would break as president.

The reversal played a role in his defeat in his bid for re-election four years later.

One of the triumphs of his presidency was his response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990.

President Bush pulled together a coalition of nations to respond.

He delivered a nationally-televised address, announcing, ""Air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq. We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities.""

Opeation Desert Storm was a success. Saddam Hussein was defeated. But he remained in power, setting the stage for another war in Iraq a decade later.

In 1997, at the dedication of his presidential library at Texas A&M University, the ceremony was opened by the state's governor, George W. Bush.

He praised his father: ""President Bush was a man who entered the political arena and left with his integrity intact.""

When George W. Bush ran for president himself, some saw it as a way to avenge his father's defeat.

The 2000 election ended in chaos. Lawyers battled over the recount in Florida, where Jeb Bush was governor. It took five weeks and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to declare a winner  George W. Bush was president-elect. Al Gore conceded defeat.

Bush spoke from the Texas state Capitol, saying, ""Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements.""

But it was a nation bitterly divided into red and blue camps. Eventually Americans did rally behind the president, when terrorists struck on Sept. 11.

President Bush addressed the nation: ""These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our country is strong.""

War in Afghanistan followed. But President Bush then went too far for many Americans when he invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

The president delivered a speech in Cincinnati, warning, ""We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.""

The stated goal was to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but none was ever found.

As the war dragged on, public support plummeted. It also sent Bush's approval rating downward, as did the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At one point his approval rating fell to 25 percent, according to Gallup, and voters drove Republicans from control in Washington.

In an interview with Morning Edition in November 2014, the former president discussed the prospect of a third Bush presidency, as his brother Jeb mulled a run. He was asked about those who said the country didn't need another Bush in the White House.

He was candid. ""In many ways the name is a plus and some ways the name is a burden, and you just described one of the burdens.""

But then he added, ""The environment is what it is. You don't get to rewrite the environment. And so Jeb has to think about whether or not he wants to be president.""

Which brings us to 2016.

When he launched his campaign, Jeb Bush would often be asked about his brother and his father. He declared that he was running as his own man, but kept tripping on the family legacy. Especially Iraq. Bush had a hard time articulating what he would have done, and he wouldn't criticize his brother.

George W. made a very rare campaign appearance with him at a rally in North Charleston last week. His 90-year-old mother, Barbara, also hit the trail with Jeb. They both remain popular with South Carolina voters and were very enthusiastically received, but to no avail.

The biggest problem was that Jeb Bush seemed to be running the kind of race that might have worked in his father's or his brother's time  but not now. The Republican Party has changed dramatically  moving to the right and rejecting the establishment. The ground was shifting right under Bush's feet.

Over the weekend, you could hear Jeb Bush finally coming to terms with that as he wrapped up the final speech of a disappointing journey.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

The world is remembering writer Harper Lee this weekend. The author of the beloved ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" died on Friday, at the age of 89. Family and friends have gathered to honor the writer in her hometown, Monroeville, Ala., which was the model for the fictional Maycomb of the novel.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DEBORAH HAZLETT: (Reading) Maycomb was an old town. But it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather, the streets turned to red slop. Grass grew on the sidewalks. The courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then. A black dog suffered on a summer's day. Bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by 9 in the morning. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was 24 hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.

MARTIN: Of course, lawyer Atticus Finch lived in Maycomb, along with his two children, Jem and his sister, who was the novel's narrator, named Scout. But in many ways, one of the most intriguing characters in the book is someone who is barely seen, a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo. Boo was about 6-and-a-half-feet-tall, judging from his tracks. He dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch. That's why his hands were bloodstained. If you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long, jagged scar that ran across his face. What teeth he had were yellow and rotten. His eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.

MARTIN: In the end, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a novel about prejudice, justice, fear and compassion - and Jem and Scout's realization that all is not right with the world, when Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, is convicted.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAZLETT: (Reading) It was Jem's turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. It ain't right, he muttered all the way to the corner of the square, where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the streetlight, looking as though nothing had happened. His vest was buttoned. His collar and tie were neatly in place, and his watch chain glistened. He was his impassive self again. It ain't right, Atticus, said Jim. No son, it's not right. How could they do it? How could they?

I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before, and they did it tonight. And they'll do it again. And when they do it, it seems that only the children weep.

MARTIN: Readings from Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" by Deborah Hazlett. Harper Lee died this past week. She was 89 years old.

As part of NPR's ""Book Your Trip"" series, TV critic Eric Deggans looks at a different kind of summertime journey, described in two books that became TV shows: PBS's documentary Freedom Summer, debuting tonight, and The Hallmark Channel's The Watsons Go to Birmingham.

When I was a kid in the mid-1970s, friends around my Indiana hometown talked about summers ""down South"" like they were heading to Disney World.

The trip was an annual, comforting ritual for black families up North with roots in the Deep South.

But there was a time, just a decade earlier, when traveling down South could mean taking your life in your hands if you were black.

""Spending a summer in Mississippi taught me a lot about this country,"" says volunteer Karin Kunstler in the first moments of PBS's American Experience documentary Freedom Summer. ""My high school social studies teacher taught me that we all have rights. Mississippi summer taught me that we didn't all have rights.""

Watch a Preview of 'Freedom Summer' PBS YouTube

Kunstler was one of more than 700 mostly white student volunteers who headed to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to challenge segregation. Freedom Summer tells the tumultuous, emotional story of that journey, using archival photos and fresh interviews with the participants to re-create one of the most dangerous summertime trips of that time.

Volunteers rode buses from Ohio to Mississippi, where they would live with black families scattered throughout the state.

At first, they felt a joyous excitement known as a ""freedom high,"" says Freedom Summer author Bruce Watson. But then, reality hit home.

""There was a lot of singing, a lot of freedom songs being sung on the bus, until they reached Mississippi,"" Watson says. ""And then, in most cases, the buses were met at the state line by highway patrolmen, who had known, of course, that they were coming. And many volunteer[s] told me that at that point, when they crossed the line, the singing stopped and it got very serious from then on.""

Once in Mississippi, volunteers faced another journey, learning to live in the crushing poverty and strict segregation suffered by their hosts.

""It's 100 years of Jim Crow ... that insisted that black people defer to whites in a way that was really shocking to everyone from the North,"" says Watson. ""Black people had to get off the sidewalk if a white person approached; black people were never called by Mr. or Mrs., they were always called by their first name or just 'boy.' All of these things, the degradation and poverty, was really startling to the volunteers, even though they had been told about it.""

Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, was a law student in 1964 who helped develop training programs for Freedom Summer volunteers.

""It's very different, even for a black kid ... going [down South] in '63 or '64,"" says Norton. ""Because then you're going with the civil rights movement in hand. So you're going critical of the environment ... which is something you might not have done in the 1950s.""

Norton also saw racist violence up close, when she tried to rescue noted activist Fannie Lou Hamer from a Mississippi jail.

toggle caption Annette Brown/Hallmark Channel

""When I asked to see Miss Hamer, this storied woman leader of the civil rights movement in the South that she was to become, she had been beaten unmercifully by a black trusty,"" she says. ""And [the white prison guards] told him, if you don't beat her [hard enough], we'll see just how you beat her and we're going to beat you even harder.""

But even the worst violence, the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, didn't keep volunteers away.

For a less violent, more personal journey, viewers can watch the Hallmark Channel's adaptation of The Watsons Go to Birmingham. It's a story about an unassuming black family caught up in the civil rights struggle while visiting relatives in Alabama  a perfect metaphor for the bitttersweet experience of traveling south back then, according to the book's author, Christopher Paul Curtis.

""When people would discuss about going south, there would be almost this idyllic tone to what they were saying,"" Curtis says. ""And you know that's not quite true, when people are being lynched and you can't have certain jobs and take care of things like that. But I think it's human nature ... [to] gloss over the bad things and remember the good.""

In one scene, the parents must tell their children how rules for travel are different in the deep South than in their Michigan hometown, noting they'll be traveling during daylight and exercising care about where they make rest stops.

Curtis says he based such scenes on information he got from older relatives who once traveled in the segregated South. ""When African-American people would travel from the North to the South, you had to do a lot of planning beforehand,"" he adds. ""There were actually books that told black people where they could stop, that gave restaurants that were either black owned or would serve black people.""

The contrast between both shows is telling. The Hallmark Channel movie features a family who joins the civil rights struggle, almost by accident. PBS's Freedom Summer shows volunteers who deliberately challenged injustice.

But both TV programs also depict another important journey: how the nation was led away from segregation by people willing to take a dangerous stand for equality.","['summer', 'mississippi', 'rights', 'tv', 'freedom', 'powerful', 'civil', 'journey', 'black', 'going', 'volunteers', 'south']"

Her music was that powerful, with lyrics woven together with beautiful harmonies; it pulled emotions out of me I didn't even know existed.

La Havas is soulful yet playful, raw and vulnerable in a commanding kind of way, and her new second album, Blood, is as amazing as the first. In this Tiny Desk performance, she plays two new songs  ""What You Don't Do"" and ""Unstoppable""  as well as ""Forget,"" from her first album. She and her talented collaborators, James Wyatt on piano and Frida Mariama Touray on backing vocals, rehearsed this special arrangement during the sound check just moments before the performance.

npr,2016-02-22 00:00:00,More Than A Marketing Trend,[],"The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing Trend

Here's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books  and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again. Those books would be Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins. So let's explore why those two are so influential.

Crime novelist Megan Abbott and Sarah Weinman of the newsletter Publisher's Lunch stopped by to discuss the phenomenon with NPR's Steve Inskeep. ""I have talked to other crime writers that have been urged by various professional people in their life to put the world girl in their title,"" says Abbott. ""It's not necessarily an issue with the content of the book itself, but there's this sort of shorthand that if it has 'girl' in the title, then I know what to expect.""

That calculus seems to be at work with a book that arrived recently at NPR's offices: Girl in the Dark, by Marion Pauw, described by its publisher as ""in the vein of blockbuster thrillers such as The Girl on the Train and The Good Girl,"" by Mary Kubica.

""I think there's really something at the root of the popularity of Flynn's and Hawkins' books that is far more important than branding or marketing,"" Abbott says, ""and I think it's the universal themes that you see in these books that speak to female readers.""

Interview Highlights

On what they read growing up

Abbott: I grew up reading crime fiction mysteries, true crime  a lot of true crime  and it is traditionally a male dominated field from the outside, but from the inside what we know, those of us who read it, is that women buy the most crime fiction, they are by far the biggest readers of true crime, and there's a voracious appetite among women for these stories, and I know I feel it  since I was quite small I wanted to go to those dark places.

Weinman: I was a voracious true crime reader, I followed trials, I read the newspapers. And I also wanted to circle back a bit because you opened the segment with Girl in the Dark by Marion Pauw, which I have happened to have read, and it's a really excellent novel. Marion Pauw is from the Netherlands, and that book, which was published there several years ago as Daglicht, was a huge bestseller and in a way calling it Girl in the Dark doesn't tell you what it's all about because it's partly about wrongful conviction, it's partly about juggling motherhood. So in a way, the girl insignia is trying to tie it into this larger marketing purpose, but sometimes it can be a disservice. Perhaps it's a notion that suspense by women is part of a broader field and of course it's been happening for decades ... this is not a new phenomenon.

On what women's crime novels have in common

Abbott: I think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train are great because they're not that similar books at all, but they're both dealing with the sort of perils of being a woman today, of marriages falling apart, of ambivalence with motherhood, the complexities of relationships among women  all this stuff that in some ways isn't taken very seriously by the culture at large, is considered  and I'm quoting here  ""women's magazine fodder,"" but it's actually very real to readers.

Weinman: Just to chime in as well, both of those books, what they have in common, what I think a lot of these other books that have climbed upon the ""girl train"" so to speak is ... people are gravitating towards these unreliable narrators. I know that when I read Gone Girl it was 2012, we were only a few years removed from the economic crash of 2008, a lot of people felt their lives were completely upended, they didn't know who to trust, and so a book like Gone Girl, which gets at the heart of a marriage that seems to be stable but is anything but, I really think that did speak to people.

On whether they still love the kind of crime writing they grew up with

Abbott: Yes, I mean, I certainly have a more gimlet eye about the world of publishing ... but the books themselves  it feels like a really exciting moment in the genre just to be able to have these heroines who might be considered too unlikable, just to have them embraced just feels kind of thrilling.

We asked Abbott and Weinman to recommend some good thrillers by women  either out now or coming soon  and here are their picks:

But motorcycles aren't just a metaphor at Bartel's Harley-Davidson shop in Marina Del Rey, Calif. They're loud and shiny and very real.

More on the Book Your Trip series For more great cycling tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

This is where we find Jeff Bragg, who claims he has been riding since he was 3. He reads an excerpt from Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels: ""Tense for the action, long hair in the wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chains, whips, swastikas and stripped-down Harleys flashing chrome as traffic on 101 moves over, nervous, to let the formation pass like a burst of dirty thunder.""

In literature, motorcycles  and the people who ride them  often represent an outlaw spirit, danger and sex. For motorcyclist Allie MacKenzie, that's a no-brainer. ""Who in their right mind can pass up a bad boy on a bike?"" MacKenzie rides a Harley Sportster Forty-Eight. At Bartel's, she picks a passage from the book Motorcycle Man by Kristen Ashley: ""I was panting, and he was cursing. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me. If he would have asked me to, I would have jumped on the back of his bike and ridden to the ends of the Earth with him.""

On the opposite end of the motorcycle fascination spectrum sits Matthew B. Crawford. By his own description, he's in the ""knowledge industry."" He has a Ph.D. and has worked at think tanks. He also owns his own motorcycle repair shop in Richmond, Va., and he's the author of Shop Class as Soulcraft  a manifesto for the importance of working with one's own hands. Fixing, restoring and riding motorcycles, he says, is very different from writing about them.

Writing ... is like pulling teeth ... it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike.

""Writing-with-a-T is like pulling teeth,"" he says, enunciating the ""t"" sound. ""There are moments of pleasure when you feel like you've really nailed it. But it's this activity where I have to force myself to sit and go over something over and over again to try to get it right, and it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike, especially when there's like heavy traffic that's moving fast and there's all these obstacles. All of your senses are just keyed in and kind of hyper alert, so it's a very heightened state of consciousness.""

That state is what Rachel Kushner captures in her novel The Flamethrowers: ""I was going one hundred miles an hour now, trying to steer properly from my hunched position as insects ticked and thumped and splatted against the windscreen. It was suicide to let the mind drift,"" she reads.

Kushner's protagonist, Reno, races through the desert trying to break a land-speed record. ""She's in the moment, very present to it, because she doesn't want to crash,"" says Kushner. ""I wrote it based on, to some degree, my own experience. I know what it's like to go very fast on motorcycles. Those moments, they stay with you.""

In literature, motorcycle trips are sometimes an escape, a way to chase away a bad marriage, a midlife crisis. A more profoundly political coming-of-age ride took place in 1952, when a 23-year-old, pre-revolutionary Che Guevara set off from Buenos Aires with a friend on the back of a Norton 500 to explore South America. Guevara's book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in 1993, years after his death, and was later turned into a movie.

""These two young men with a shared love of adventure, of women, of speed, and this bike, and this shared political yearning,"" says journalist Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Anderson says the seven- or eight-month motorcycle trip was really a coming of age for medical student Guevara and his friend.

""The idea [was] that they needed to see something of their continent beyond the rather privileged confines of their Argentina, their white Argentina,"" says Anderson. ""They took off on this bike and traveled through the indigenous and mestizo back roads and backwoods of their continent. It was an extraordinary experience for young Guevara. It really was a determinant in his life, deciding what he would become.""



The Norton broke down, as motorcycles will  but even that experience can take you someplace, a phenomenon Robert Pirsig examines in his now classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

""When you get stuck on fixing motorcycles, that's not a bad moment. That's actually a pretty good moment,"" he told NPR in 1974. ""The times I've been stuck, I've been able to catch myself at being stuck and, instead of getting mad, just gone off and had a cup of coffee. And I notice whenever I'm stuck like that, that if I look at the clouds, the clouds are much more beautiful. I find at the very moment of stuckness, if you just stop and look around you, you find the world is very real.""

Back at Bartel's, biker Ron Hamberg reads from Zen, a moment in which Pirsig contrasts riding a motorcycle with the more passive act of driving in a car. In a car, Pirsig writes, ""you're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle, the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore. And the sense of presence is overwhelming.""

Hamberg  covered with tattoos  rides a Harley. He says he has read books by Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Mahatma Gandhi. But as for books about motorcycles, he growls, ""I just ride 'em. I don't read about 'em.""","['guevara', 'metaphor', 'motorcycles', 'state', 'experience', 'literary', 'stuck', 'moment', 'bike', 'motorcycle', 'book', 'thats']"
npr,2015-02-18 00:00:00,"Why you should always use ""transgender"" instead of ""transgendered""",['German Lopez'],"Questions of language are deeply ingrained in the fight for transgender rights and equality. It's not just a matter of being polite. If someone calls a trans man a woman, it fundamentally cuts against the person's gender identity.

But there are still big barriers, even among traditionally liberal media outlets, toward getting the basics of trans-inclusive vocabulary right. A recent story in the New Republic referred to trans people as ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwomen""  all of which are offensive to many trans people.

BuzzFeed LGBT Editor Saeed Jones echoed some of the offense in a recent tweet:

Also, its ""transgender,"" not ""transgendered."" ""Transgendered"" is the linguistic equivalent of describing someone as ""blacked.""  Saeed Jones (@theferocity) February 17, 2015

Getting this right isn't just a matter of being inclusive toward trans people, although that should be reason enough. It can also help readers become familiar with the correct terms.

As New York Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan explained last week, one of the major challenges for news outlets is that most readers just aren't familiar with how to correctly refer to people with non-traditional gender identities. And in some cases, referring to someone with the correct terms can be a little confusing  calling Chelsea Manning, a transgender soldier who's in prison for leaking secret US documents, ""she"" after years of addressing her in news stories as ""he"" may have confused some readers, even though using the correct pronoun for Manning is the right editorial call.

Of course, there are ways around this. A writer could explain what the terms mean within a story. News outlets could link readers to clear definitions, similar to what BuzzFeed does with its house style guide. Stories could also point readers to more in-depth glossaries, like the GLAAD Media Reference Guide or UC Berkeley Gender Equity Resource Center's definition of terms.

Most importantly, media outlets have to first get the terms right for themselves. But two common mistakes persist, as seen in the New Republic's use of the terms ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwoman."" Here's why those terms are not just inaccurate but can cause such great offense when they're used.

Transgender vs. transgendered

The umbrella term for people who identify with a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth is ""transgender"" or ""trans."" These words are adjectives, not nouns. Additionally, the word ""transgendered"" is offensive to trans people and unnecessarily confusing.

As trans advocate Joanne Herman noted in the Huffington Post, calling someone transgendered is a bit like calling someone ""colored."" ""One problem with this label was that it implied something happened to make the person 'of color,' which denied the person's dignity of being born that way,"" Herman wrote. Similarly, transgendered suggests that being trans is something that happens to someone, as opposed to an identity someone is born with.

The implication behind transgendered flies in the face of science: people can know their gender identity at a very young age. A recent study from the TransYouth Project found that transgender children as young as five years old respond to psychological gender-association tests, which evaluate how people view themselves within gender roles, as quickly and consistently as those who don't identify as trans.

Transgendered is also unnecessarily long and confusing. LGBT group GLAAD explained: ""The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous '-ed' tacked onto the end. An '-ed' suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. It also brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, and bisexual. You would not say that Elton John is 'gayed' or Ellen DeGeneres is 'lesbianed,' therefore you would not say Chaz Bono is 'transgendered.'""

Trans men and trans women vs. transmen and transwomen

A trans man is someone who identifies as a man but was designated female at birth. A trans woman is someone who identifies as a woman but was designated male at birth. Some trans people prefer to leave the word transgender or trans out altogether, since they only identify as a man or woman.

Writers shouldn't use ""transman"" or ""transwoman."" The word trans is an adjective that helps describe someone's gender identity, and it should be treated like other adjectives. Merging the adjective and the noun risks suggesting that a trans man or woman is more (or less) than just a man or just a woman, which goes against how many trans people identify themselves.

Internationally acclaimed Italian author and philosopher Umberto Eco has died at age 84. His death was confirmed by his American publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

Born in a small Italian town in 1932, Eco is perhaps best known for his 1980 mystery novel The Name of the Rose, which is set in a monastery in the 14th century. It was an unexpected international bestseller, launching his career as an author.

Eco didn't publish his first novel until he was 48, when a friend suggested he write a detective story. Before that, his focus was medieval studies and semiotics. And even after he published novels, he said ""I am a philosopher ... I write novels only on the weekends,"" the BBC reported.

Here's how Eco described his transition into fiction in an interview with The Paris Review:

""I have long thought that what most philosophical books are really doing at the core is telling the story of their research, just as scientists will explain how they came to make their major discoveries. So I feel that I was telling stories all along, just in a slightly different style.""

He told NPR's Scott Simon last October that several of his novels like Foucault's Pendulum and Numero Zero focused on characters that he affectionately termed ""losers""  because ""they are more interesting than the winners.""

""They have a more complicated philosophy,"" Eco told Scott. ""And then in the world, there are more losers than winners, and so my readers can identify themselves with the characters.""

Eco's works tend to be challenging and laden with obscure references. But as he told The New York Times, he considered ""challenging"" a compliment: ""Only publishers and television people believe that people crave easy experiences.""

According to the Times, he had already decided in 1995 ""what he wants carved on his tombstone. In a book by the Renaissance philosopher Tommaso Campanella, a character says, 'Wait, wait,' and another man responds, 'I cannot.'

In the weeks since the world was introduced to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the full power of its diverse casting has been revealed. It has engaged millions who might have ignored the film after the prequels disappeared into the Sarlacc pit of critical disdain. It's brought a shine to the eyes of children who'd never seen their reflections in a story so grand and sweeping. And it's led already-addicted fans to talk and think differently about the franchise they love.

Much has been written about the decision to cast Nigerian-British actor John Boyega as escaped Stormtrooper FN-2187, whose race and even species are ambiguous in the film's shooting script, and the fact that two of the film's other leading heroes are played by a young woman and an actor of Guatemalan descent. It's been noted that these choices reflect today's diverse American population, expand the $30 billion franchise's potential global audience  Star Wars has accrued nearly 150 million fans around the world, making its fandom the 9th most populous nation on Earth  and make the film a truer reflection of the present and future.

Of course, change has not been welcomed by all.

But of course, change has not been welcomed by all. Among those who see the whiteness and maleness of heroes as a divine right, these casting choices triggered some of the more virulent social media reactions of recent memory, a great disturbance rippling out to the farthest reaches of pop culture.

This battle between factions  those accepting ""darkness"" in their onscreen heroes (and with it, openness, change and progress), and those stubbornly clinging to ""lightness"" (and thus psychic closure, defiant self-delusion and often plain-and-simple racism), played out multiple times throughout 2015, as other ""nontraditional"" casting choices sparked similar backlash from the uglier crevices of the Internet.

Michael B. Jordan as Fantastic Four hothead Johnny Storm? Human Torch is now black for some PC reason. Stick to the source material and stop the nonsense!

Mehcad Brooks as Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl series? Blackwashed again. Getting mighty fed up with this. Will not be watching.

And, in what must have seemed like the ultimate final straw for casting purists, Noma Dumezweni as an adult Hermione Granger in the sold-out Harry Potter stage sequel? Seriously f unhappy with this! Why do we keep changing characters' race?

Hardly any of these reactions challenged the skills or appeal of the actors in question, or whether they could play the roles effectively. Some fans simply couldn't accept that the color of an actor's skin conflicted with the character they had in their minds, underscoring that even in the genres of speculative fiction and fantasy  stories unrestricted by space, time and the limits of physics!  differences in race and ethnicity remain a twilight zone too forbidding for many otherwise imaginative individuals to traverse.

They have no problem believing a man can fly. They recoil, however, when that man is black.

They have no problem believing a man can fly. They recoil, however, when that man is black.

Of course, Caucasian audience-goers aren't the only ones accustomed to melanin-deficient heroes. Anyone who came of age on a diet of Western culture's greatest hits is susceptible to the idea that when it comes to adventure stories, people of color belong on the sidelines (or down in the underworld).

From our earliest storybook read-alouds, every princess was a ""fair maiden,"" every hero a ""white knight,"" and if there was ever a villainous vizier, diabolical demon or traitorous templar, he was invariably described as swarthy, dark or black.

Disney's animated tales often doubled down on the White Makes Right meme, with one royal named Snow White and another named Cinderella, who, invisible when darkened by the dirt and soot of her labors, cleans up as a glorious blond woman drawing every eye.

And then there were the comic books, which over my lifetime evolved from kiddie fare to adult geek obsession to mainstream blockbuster fodder. Who doesn't know the story of Superman, that musclebound alien from another planet who somehow managed to end up looking like a plausible cousin to Don Draper?

Those of us who loved comics accepted that the caped crusaders of our four-color pulp fantasies  no matter how mutant or alien or non-humanoid their backstories  had to be rendered in shades of pale, because that's what the pages in our sweaty little palms told us to do.

There is no sadder example of this suspension of disbelief than a recent New York Times op-ed by Malaysian radio host Umapagan Ampikaipakan titled ""That Oxymoron, the Asian Comic Superhero."" In it, Ampikaipakan questioned the wisdom of the ""current push to draw diversity into comics.

Growing up in Malaysia, Ampikaipakan and his childhood friends were ""brown and yellow,"" he writes, ""but we didn't mind that our role models were all white."" In fact, rendering them otherwise might have been destructive, potentially ""undercutting the genre's universal appeal.""

That appeal was rooted in notions of the American dream  that is to say, the Anglo-American dream, red for courage, blue for truth, and white, well, because to Ampikaipakan and to all of us raised in a postcolonial cultural context, white is often the default shade associated with people who are heroic and good and just.

Despite the increasing volume of calls to diversify pop culture, Ampikaipakan's view remains the dominant one in media and entertainment. Whiteness remains universal, all-encompassing, ""normal."" To make a protagonist any other race or ethnicity requires an accounting for one's actions.

Take a look at what happened when Sony remade the classic musical Annie, based on the classic comic strip Little Orphan Annie, with African-American actors Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx in lead roles. The endeavor was bombarded with complaints and questions about why a ""black Annie"" was necessary. ""I wanna live in a colorless world but I will not stand for a black Annie. #EnoughSaid,"" tweeted one skeptic.

But here's the thing: reimagining classic characters as non-white may not always be as much of a stretch as the purists would have you believe. Take a closer look at some of the most popular comics franchises out here, and if you cock your head ever so slightly, you'll start to wonder if white really is the only color that matches these stories.

For starters, set aside the way Joe Shuster and hundreds of comics artists since have rendered Superman, and take another look at the hero's backstory: a dark-haired refugee from a distant, exotic place, where people have weird, hyphenated names like Jor-El and Lor-Van. Once he arrives in America, he is transracially (trans-specially?) adopted by parents in the Heartland, and raised to ""fit in"" with everyone else, but also to preserve and appreciate his hidden heritage.

He moves to the big city, where he hides behind dorky glasses and displays a humble, passive persona to his coworkers. But in his spare time, he embraces his true self, gathers with others like himself and lets it all hang out.

To sum up? That dude Asian.

A similar case can be made for Spider-Man, a dark-haired, glasses-wearing nerd named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider on a science field trip. Consider that Parker has always been depicted as being from Queens, home to the largest Korean-American community on the East Coast, and you could imagine his secret identity as ""Peter Park"" instead.

(Marvel may have had the same thought: In 2014, the company introduced a Korean-American member of the Spider-fam: Cindy Moon, better known as Silk, who got her powers from the very same spider that transformed Peter Park. Er, Parker.)

And then there's The Hulk, the alter ego of a nuclear physicist who in an instant goes from celebrated scientist to accused traitor, hunted by the government, charged with allowing a top-secret weapon of mass destruction to escape U.S. military hands.

When I think of The Hulk's origin story, I can't help but recall the cases of Wen Ho Lee, Xiaoxing Xi, and other Asian-American scientists who, in recent history, saw their careers transformed in a flash when they were accused of spying for China and hounded by federal prosecutors, charges that were in several cases later dropped (and linked to racial profiling).

The point of these thought experiments is that, contrary to what defenders of wall-to-wall whiteness in pop culture will have you believe, it's not impossible to imagine heroes of color  or to reimagine existing heroes as another color. And in fact, when we do so, it can move storytelling forward, into unexpected, undiscovered, unexplored territories.

And isn't that what these genres are all about?

A new hope

Of course, with the unknown comes fear and anxiety. For a lot of ""traditionalist"" sci-fi and fantasy fans, the big worry seems to be that heroes who look like, well, everybody else will somehow become inaccessible and unrelatable. (Of course, those of us who grew up non-white can testify that it's possible to empathize with someone you don't look like.)

And it's absolutely true: rethinking the default whiteness of heroic stories will fundamentally change them. Done properly, however, this can bring fresh energy, new texture and unexpected resonance to stories that have become hidebound, and free them from genre conventions that have become stifling.

For example, the revelation that FN-2187 is black opens up all sorts of intriguing potential backstory for the First Order's Stormtrooper army. Most of the imagery associated with the First Order is inspired by Nazi Germany: The salutes, the uniforms, enormous rallies under giant red and black banners, the embrace of genocidal ""Final Solutions,"" the term ""stormtrooper"" itself.

That's nothing new. In popular culture, the Nazi aesthetic has long served as the signpost of ultimate evil, so much so that the Internet is littered with essays decrying this cinematic reductio ad Hitlerum cliche.

But unlike prior generations of Imperial soldiers, the First Order's stormtroopers aren't clones. FN-2187 and his fellow legionnaires are forced conscripts, abducted as young children from their home planets. The fact that the First Order's overseers are depicted as white humans, while the only Stormtrooper whose face we've seen is an abducted and enslaved black man, provides an opening. It raises a whole host of unsettling and fascinating new questions about what the First Order wants, and how it works, that future episodes will have a chance to answer.

All of this adds specificity and gravity to the arousal of FN-2187's conscience, and his eventual emergence as Finn, our hero. Yet his quest for freedom and thirst for redemption remain unquestionably universal. They span not just galaxies, but time itself. And of course, we shouldn't discount Boyega's performance: It's brilliantly deft, fresh and fun to watch  arguably the film's most nuanced and human turn.

That's what diverse characters, performers, and creators can bring to the page, the stage and the screen. Having a wider and deeper pool of options makes it more likely that you'll discover breakthrough talent like Star Wars's Boyega, who's not only a fabulous actor, but also wields the power to transform any story he touches in fresh, exhilarating ways.

There's also evidence that diverse storytellers can perform a sort of Jedi Mind Trick on us, the audience, helping over time to flush out the toxic abscesses of racial fear, hate and scorn that continue to plague America.

Take a recent study of 2,000 people who watched the web comedy series Halal in the Family, a sitcom parody featuring The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi as the patriarch of a Muslim-American family. The study, which was commissioned by the creators of the show and conducted by researchers from Seton Hall, the University of Washington, and New York University, found that after watching the show, viewers had more favorable associations toward Muslim Americans, and less unconscious bias against them.

That's not the only research showing that diversity in pop culture has real-world impact. MIT professor Edward Schiappa found that after watching shows with queer protagonists  Will & Grace, Six Feet Under and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  subjects were more likely to disagree with anti-gay statements and to see queer individuals more positively.

There's a good chance that your actual social network doesn't include people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Surprisingly, even in an era of global digital connectivity, 91 percent of the average white American's friends are white. But on-screen protagonists can serve as something like friend proxies, providing what researchers call ""parasocial relationships"" that help to (literally) color one's perspective on reality.

When we see characters who we perceive as ""different"" getting to do all the things human beings do in real life  kick butt in their careers, goof around with their kids  or go beyond, reaching for the stars and bending the universe to their will, it changes how we look at ""different"" people in the real world.

""At this point, it's a pretty unequivocal finding that TV can affect how people feel and think about others,"" Schiappa told Code Switch last year. ""When you're exposed to a wide variety of people in a certain minority group,"" he said, ""your ideas about that group get more complicated.""

The bottom line is that enriching pop culture with heroes of all colors, cultures, genders and identities doesn't just make stories better  it may have the power to ultimately makes us better as well.

""A black Stormtrooper, or a female Jedi, or even a suburban Muslim dad at first confound us, and then become unremarkable,"" says Mik Moore, one of the creators of Halal in the Family. ""They provide evidence of what's possible.""

A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, it might have made sense to imagine that heroes had to look a certain way. That era is gone forever. There has been an awakening  and it's time for the Force to come to balance.
