msnbc,2015-03-24 15:31:00,Where Are They Now: Locker Lookz,['Frank Silverstein'],"JoAnn Brewer and Christi Sterling are two moms from Dallas who built a business based on a series of decorations they made by hand for their middle school daughters lockers. When other parents called to ask where they bought them, JoAnn and Christi realized they might have a marketable product. And Locker Lookz was born.

While the idea was easy and fun, the process of taking that idea and turning it into a business was quite difficult.

Your Business chronicled the process that followed, which led the duo from a marketing consultant to a trade show to a manufacturer to a retail buyer. With a contract to purchase based on their homemade craft items, they identified a broker to find a factory in China, produce prototypes, negotiate terms and delivery, and finally find a fulfillment to deliver the final order to the retail stores. Despite a few stumbles and missteps, JoAnn and Christi got through their first year, and Locker Lookz has since taken off.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER



Its now been two years since we first met JoAnn and Christi, and they are still very much in business. They have since partnered with a wholesale craft supply company, Darice, which allows them focus their efforts in the areas they most enjoy. We are still very involved from a product development and creative standpoint, but without all the heavy lifting, they said in an email to msnbc.

More exciting still, they have added a new line of products for decorating tween-age bedrooms called Room Lookz. The line offers colorful products like pillows, mirrors, lamps, and desk items to appeal middle school-age girls.

In February 2015, JoAnn and Christi attended the annual Toy Fair in New York City, where they introduced their new Room Lookz line alongside the latest items for Locker Lookz.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-16 15:32:00,Kentucky lawmaker responds to anti-choice law with bill restricting access to Viagra,[],"When her colleagues in the Kentucky legislature decided to pass legislation requiring women to see a doctor 24 hours before having an abortion, Democratic state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian decided to give the bills male supporters a taste of their own medicine. So she introduced a measure she thought equally invasive from their perspective  a bill requiring men to jump through hoops before they can receive drugs for erectile dysfunction.

Introduced last Thursday, House Bill 396 significantly hampers access to erectile dysfunction treatments including Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and Avanafil. If passed, the measure would require every man seeking such drugs to have two doctor visits, provide a signed-and-dated consent letter from his current spouse and make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use the drugs for sex with his current spouse. Only married men would be eligible for erectile dysfunction treatment under the legislation.

Marzian introduced HB 396 one week after Kentuckys Republican Gov. Matt Bevin signed into law a controversial informed consent bill, making the Bluegrass State the 27th in the nation to require that women seeking an abortion undergo counseling and then wait a specified amount of time  most often 24 hours  before they can have the procedure.

I thought, well, if were going to meddle in the private medical decisions between a woman and her health care provider, then we can meddle in mens private health care decisions as well, Marzian told MSNBC in a phone interview Tuesday.

The 61-year-old registered nurse, who has served in the Kentucky House of Representatives since 1994, acknowledged HB 396 stands little chance of passing. Its tongue in cheek, she said.

At the same time, Marzian also believes her proposal addresses a very serious matter  that is, when government ... feels its appropriate to insert themselves into personal, private medical decisions.

The legislature doesnt have a medical degree, said Marzian. Its inappropriate, insulting and demeaning to have this patriarchal view that women cannot talk to their own physicians and figure out what they need to do. All of these anti-choice bills are designed to make it more difficult to obtain safe and legal abortion services.

Its not the the first time a lawmaker has responded to abortion restrictions with an over-the-top proposal targeting men. In 2012, for example, as the Oklahoma Senate considered a personhood bill stipulating that life begins at the moment of conception, former state Sen. Constance Johnson, a Democrat, put forth an amendment that would have outlawed masturbation.

If were talking about protecting life, Johnson reasoned in a satirical segment for The Daily Show, then lets talk about life at its very basic beginning.

Johnsons amendment failed. And in all likelihood, Marzians bill will too. But shes hopeful it wont be the last of its kind.

Already, Marzian said shes preparing an amendment that would apply the same waiting period now required for abortions to gun sales. Under this measure, anyone hoping to buy a firearm would have to wait 24 hours and sit through a counseling session with victims of gun violence, she said.

Marzian is also hoping her approach inspires reproductive rights supporters in other states to fight back against legislation restricting abortion access.

I think it really has awakened the sleeping giant, she said of HB 396. Ive had over 500 emails so far and almost all of them have been supportive and saying they are sick and tired of governments, mostly men, inserting themselves in their doctors office.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-21 16:10:00,Governor John Kasich signs Ohio bill to cut Planned Parenthood funding,[],"Republican presidential hopeful and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday signed a bill that aims to strip funding from Planned Parenthood in the state.

Its a long-expected but controversial move that ignites a debate that seeped into his presidential campaign. Kasich faced a number of protesters this week while campaigning in South Carolina who challenged him on the issue during his events.

After Kasich came in a strong second place in the New Hampshire primary, the Republican assembly in Ohio passed legislation that targets about $1.3 million in funding for Planned Parenthood in the state.

That money helps support screenings for breast cancer, STD testing, programs working to prevent violence against women, and more. State and federal laws already prohibit taxpayer dollars from going to fund abortions, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

RELATED: Planned Parenthood: Kasich is terrible for womens health

Although the legislation does not specifically name the organization  it cites any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions  and its believed that Planned Parenthood will be most affected.

Planned Parenthood immediately fired back to the news, as the organizations president Cecile Richards claimed the bill will have devastating consequences for women across Ohio.

Its clear Kasich has no regard for womens health or lives, and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood, she said in a statement.

Kasich was repeatedly asked about the issue of Planned Parenthood at his town halls across New Hampshire throughout the summer, fall and winter, and consistently told audiences that he doesnt believe government funding should go to the organization because he says they discredited themselves, and adds that he favors funding for womens health through other means.

The fact is that Governor Kasich has been a strong advocate for womens health issues by helping 260,000 women gain access to health care coverage, pledging a 3-1 state match for a fund for breast and cervical cancer screenings, strengthening programs for sexual assault prevention, funding rape crisis centers for the first time in Ohios history, helping more women get access to childcare and protecting women from human trafficking, his spokesman Joe Andrews said in a statement.

RELATED: Anti-Planned Parenthood activists reversal of fortune

The state, through the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) has at least 150 other sub-grantees and contractors for the affected grants and projects addressing such issues as infant mortality, violence against women, and minority HIV/AIDS. ODH will reallocate funding from ineligible providers under the new law to other currently eligible providers, ranging from local health departments and community organizations to hospitals and universities.

It was suspected that Kasich might sign the bill before the South Carolina primary, in the hopes that the move would help him there, but instead he signed it one day after finishing with about 8 percent, near the bottom of the pack in the state.

As the bill moved to Kasichs office while he campaigned across South Carolina, the governors events were interrupted by protesters in Bluffton, Fort Mill, and Mt. Pleasant, who each shouted, Governor Kasich, why do you hate womens health?

Kasich responded to each interruption the same way, remarking as a kid who went to college in 70s, if I dont see a good protest, I aint living.

Give em a round of applause, they are allowed to come in and scream, he added when he was interrupted at his election eve rally aboard the USS Yorktown off Mt. Pleasant.

The women who interrupted him in Bluffton on Wednesday work for Planned Parenthood, and one of them was from Kasichs home state.

Im from the state of Ohio and Im a little disappointed that Governor Kasich is cutting off preventative health care services from tens of thousands of women in the state of Ohio, said Emma Akpan, a Planned Parenthood field organizer, who was one of three protesters at the event who held signs saying Who pays for cancer treatment? Can I get birth control at the dentist? and Why do you hate womens health??

The fact that Governor Kasich is cutting off this funding  he is hurting women in Ohio, she added.

Responding to the protesters in Bluffton, Kasich told his crowd, We are not cutting off womens health and were not going to fund Planned Parenthood cause they put themselves in this pickle.

What were gonna do is make sure that womens health will get funding, he said. I do not mind when young people feel passionately about something. Its a lot better than seeing them on these electronic devices and all that kind of stuff.

msnbc,2016-02-21 16:01:00,Gov. John Kasich signs bill to strip Ohio Planned Parenthood of government funds,[],"Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a bill on Sunday to divert Planned Parenthood of government funding in the state.

The expected move comes one day after the presidential contenders lackluster finish in the South Carolina Republican primary, in which Kasich placed fifth with 8 percent out of the six viable candidates.

While the piece of legislation, known as House Bill 294, does not mention Planned Parenthood specifically, supporters say the organization would be affected most by the bill. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio launched digital advertisements and videos against the governor earlier this week when the bill was sent to his desk.

The measure targets about $1.3 million in funds that Planned Parenthood receives via the states Department of Health. The funding, which largely comes from federal sources, covers cancer screenings, HIV testing and initiatives to prevent domestic violence, but the legislation would forbid funding institutions that are affiliated with abortion. Under the bill, Ohios health department must ensure that state funds and certain federal funds are not used either to perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions, or to contract or affiliate with any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions, according to a statement from Kasichs office.

Kasich signed a state budget in 2013 that reduced funding to Planned Parenthood and has signed at least 16 pieces of anti-abortion legislation since he assumed the governorship in 2011.

There is now only one strong conservative in this race who can win, and we see conservatives continually unite behind our campaign, Cruz said.

The Texas senator reiterated that hes the only Republican who has a chance of beating rival Donald Trump because Donald spends every waking moment attacking me. He doesnt attack any other candidates, because his campaign views us as the only real threat to him.

He continued: Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and that can beat Donald Trump.

Cruz, finished just one point behind Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in the first-in-the-South primary, which Cruz says is effectively a tie for second.

RELATED: Even Donald Trump cant stop Donald Trump

Even so, Cruzs showing cant be welcome news in a state with high evangelical turn-out like South Carolina. He balked at the suggestion that means conservatives arent rallying behind him yet.

Our path to victory from the beginning was always do well in the first four states, and then have a strong, strong night on Super Tuesday coming up on March 1st, Cruz said.

His home state of Texas is one of the states voting on March 1st, also known as Super Tuesday. Asked if he will beat Trump in his own backyard, Cruz may not have reassured his supporters when he told Chuck Todd, I certainly hope so. Were going to work hard to do so.

Pressed on whether Texas is a must-win contest for him, Cruz replied, We hope we do well. I believe we will do well...Texas is clearly the crown jewel of Super Tuesday. We believe were going to do very, very well in Texas and were going to do very well across Super Tuesday. view photo essay The presidential campaign: Ted Cruz The Texas senator was first to announce his bid back in March, and has since been carefully laying the groundwork for a come-from-behind primary victory.

Turning to attacks from fellow Republican candidates questioning his honesty - and calling him a liar outright - Cruz said, I will not respond in kind. I do not intend to insult any of the candidates.

Cruz gave a 30-minute press conference earlier in the week responding to some of the very charges Trump and Rubio were leveling against him. Was he letting his challengers get under his skin? Both of them were relying on fabrications, Cruz claimed. However, I was then and am now very much a happy warrior.

msnbc,2015-02-06 18:45:00,Where Are They Now: Monterey Makeover,['Frank Silverstein'],"In May 2014, we traveled to the famous Fishermans Wharf in Monterey, California to answer two viewers call for help.

JOE & MARY DELECCE

Joe and Mary Delecce have successfully run four separate jewelry shops on the Monterey pier for over 15 years. Their son, who asked not to be named, wrote to us because he was afraid the stores wouldnt be able to support Joe and Marys retirement.

My parents gave everything to give us a leg up in our world and never asked for something in return, the Delecces son said. They are 64 and 65 years old  without a retirement nest egg. With nothing to fall back on, the Delecces needed a new strategy.

ENTER: YOUR BUSINESS SWAT TEAM

Our goal was to transform this business into a rock-solid nest egg for retirement.

First, we reached out to Chris Myers, founder of BodeTree, a Denver-based financial software company. Chris synced up the Delecces accounting system, Quickbooks, with his BodeTree analytics software. With it, he identified the strong and weak areas of the business and helped Joe and Mary create a plan to double their companys valuation to $1.2 million.

Chris passed his financial analysis on to Helen Bulwik, a retail specialist and partner at San Francisco-based Newport Board Group. Helen advises top retailers like Macys and Nordstrom, and she volunteered to help the Delecces.

Helen saw two key problems with this business: The Delecces maintained a very large payroll, as they staffed four separate shops, and they had too much inventory tying up their working capital.

Close video Monterey Makeover: Part Two Take a look at the second part of the Monterey Makeover. embed like save share group

Helen identified that Joe and Marys silver store brought in almost 50 percent of sales, yet took up 70 percent of their inventory. She suggested Joe and Mary cut their inventory in half. One of their biggest rules for buyers at Macys is to reduce assortments, not expand them, Helen explained. [They] identify top-selling items and eliminate everything else.

In order for the Delecces to track which styles were selling fastest, we brought in Dawn Brolin, CPA. Thanks to a donation from the Intuit Reseller Program, Dawn provided the Delecces with a brand new point-of-sale (POS) system that will allow the Delecces to tag every single item in the store and track whats selling out and when.

Helen also surprised the Delecces when she pointed out that their money-saving practice of buying loose pearls and stringing them themselves might actually be a selling point to their customers. She suggested that instead of stringing pearls in the back of the store, the Delecces should make the process visible to customers. Bring it out front to entertain the customers, and it will boost your sales, Helen said, identifying the practice as retail-tainment.

DOWNSIZING  AND UPGRADING

Helen also suggested the Delecces consolidate their four locations. She introduced interior designers Michael Bodziner and Amy Taylor of architecture and design firm Gensler. Michael and Amy drew up plans and suggested a new name for the single store: Monterey Bay Jewelry Company. Their plans called for a special booth out front so the pearl-stringer could be used to attract new customers while demonstrating his craft.

The Gensler plan also called for updated furniture to modernize the look. To offset the cost of the new jewelry cases, Helen arranged for Premier Store Fixtures to provide the custom-made cases at no cost.

To pay for the remainder of the store makeover, the Delecces sold off some of their less popular inventory at a discount  and made nearly $100,000 to reinvest in their store.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: NINE MONTHS LATER

The Delecces are now busy preparing for their grand re-opening, slated for March 2015. They chose one store to expand and act as their sole location going forward. While that is under renovation, they are also cleaning out their other storefronts and preparing them to be leased to new tenants.

The Delecces loved the new name Monterey Bay Jewelry and submitted the plans for the new sign to the city planning commission. They received notice that the new sign was approved and displayed it on their storefront in February.

The new display cases from Premier Store Fixtures arrived, and Joe says they are even more beautiful than they looked in the drawings. The Delecces have begun to integrate the inventory from the four sites, and that means weeding through thousands of items. Once everything has been cataloged into the new POS system, they will be able to track sales and focus on increasing turnover.

Its something weve been dreaming about, talking about  and now youve brought it to fulfillment, Mary said. So its really hard to say a simple thank you!",[]
msnbc,2016-02-21 14:15:00,RNC chair on brokered convention: 'We're prepared for anything',[],"Donald Trumps first-place finish in South Carolina has revived an ongoing discussion about the possibility of a brokered Republican convention, the prospect of which became a central question as the candidates made the rounds of the post-primary Sunday shows.

The business mogul toppled his rivals in the Palmetto State with 33 percent of the vote. Sen. Marco Rubio, his nearest competitor, came in 10 percentage points behind him and barely overtook Sen. Ted Cruz for second place. Trumps victories in South Carolina and New Hampshire, as well as his second-place finish in Iowa, give him a decisive lead in the delegate count and establish him as the clear front-runner going into the February 23 Nevada caucus  a scenario that has sent some Republicans into a panic.

When asked by Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union if party leaders do not take Trump seriously despite his strong showings, Trump pointed to his status as an outsider.

All of the establishment sort of said, Well, wait a minute. What happened to him? Hes not supposed to be doing that. Thats not in the cards, Trump said of his presidential bid. I dont want money. You know, Im self-funding my campaign, so I dont need donor money and lobbyist money and special interest money. And that bothers them because the special interests want to control their candidates, and I cant be controlled.

RELATED: Jeb Bush leaves behind a party he can barely recognize

Some on the right have argued that if the GOP field does not consolidate behind one or two alternative candidates in the coming weeks, the chances of Trump winning the nomination or the GOP having a brokered convention would increase dramatically. However, Trump dismissed the notion of a brokered convention, which would occur if no candidate has the required amount of delegates to secure the nomination. The Republicans would then take the battle to the convention floor to decide on a nominee in July.

I dont think were going to have a convention, a brokered convention. I think its unlikely. I think Im doing better than that. And so far, you know, Im really on my way, Trump told Tapper. I thought I actually won Iowa if you look at it really closely. But even if I didnt, I just got one delegate less because I came in a very, very close second. So I have a second and I have two firsts. And New Hampshire was a blowout, and this one was a blowout.

Despite telling reporters earlier this month that his campaign was planning for a race that could go to the convention floor, Marco Rubio on Sunday also dismissed talk of a brokered convention while decrying party insiders.

I dont think its likely. I think the voters are going to decide it. I most certainly dont want party insiders deciding this, because if party insiders had been the ones deciding this nomination, I wouldnt be standing. I wouldnt be here right now doing this interview with you, Rubio said in an interview with Tapper. I wouldnt have even been in the Senate, for that matter. They didnt want me in the Senate.

On ABCs This Week, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus denied that Trumps rise was an indictment of the party leadership. Priebus also insisted that the RNC would support whomever the eventual nominee is, even as Trump continues to claim that the committee is treating him unfairly.

I think its early in the process, but certainly when the time comes and when were sitting either before Cleveland or at Cleveland or whenever that point may come, and we have a presumptive nominee, what will happen is the RNC will join in with that nominee, and we will put together the biggest, which weve already started doing, the biggest ground game and data operation that weve ever seen, Priebus said.

When asked if the RNC was planning for a brokered convention, Priebus said he doubted that one would occur but that the party leadership would be ready if necessary.

Planning can mean a lot of things. Were prepared for anything. I was general counsel for two years before I was chairman of this party, Ive been chairman for six years. I dont think there are too many people that are more familiar with the procedures of nominating someone at a convention than I am, Priebus told George Stephanopoulos. So Im prepared, and we will be prepared if that happens, but again, I dont think thats going to be the case. If it did, then of course, obviously, it would be pretty historic. But well be ready.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-19 11:54:00,African-American group based in Nevada's largest county backs Bernie Sanders,[],"As the Democratic presidential candidates make their closing arguments before Nevada Democrats caucus on Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders won support from an African-American group.

The Clark County Black Caucus, an organization located in Nevadas largest county, endorsed Sanders late Thursday, a move that could help him as he tries to cut into the former secretary of states lead among black voters.

With continuing unemployment disproportionately impacting Black Nevadans, over representation in prisons and the justice system, low performing schools, and lack of economic opportunity, we are looking for a President that will dismantle broken systems, and provide access to a new deal, Yvette Williams, chairwoman of the caucus wrote in a letter published Thursday.

She added that although Secretary Hillary Clinton is well qualified, it comes down to individual choice, and Sanders agenda, including his commitment to getting big money out of politics and restoring our government back to its people is an important concern of CCBC members.

The endorsement comes as Nevadas latest poll shows the race between Sanders and Clinton in a dead heat. According to a CNN/ORC poll released on Wednesday, 48% of likely caucus-goers are supporting Clinton, while 47% will back the Vermont independent.

After a razor-thin loss in the Iowa caucuses and a solid win in the New Hampshire primary, Sanders has turned his attention to other key primary states with more diverse electorates. Polls show him trailing behind Clinton among minority voters by double digits.

Clinton has received numerous endorsements from key black elected officials. Sanders, until recently, got the backing from some high-profile black supporters, including former NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and civil rights icon Harry Belafonte.",[]
msnbc,2016-02-21 13:14:00,"Decision 2016: Front-runners get major wins, solidify their advantages ahead of Super Tuesday",['Perry Bacon Jr'],"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have now won two of the first three races in their respective primaries and caucuses, putting the two front-runners in very strong positions heading to March, when more than two dozen states will hold primaries or caucuses.

For Clinton, the Nevada victory is an important turnabout after her 22-point drubbing against Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. She is a heavy favorite to win South Carolinas Jan. 27 primary, which would mean the former secretary of state had won three of the first four contests in the Democratic race.

Clintons win in Nevada came in part because of her substantial advantage among black voters, who favored her 76 percent to 22 percent, according to exit polls.

In polls, African-Americans in South Carolina are backing her by a similarly enormous margin.

Looking forward, many of the states that will vote in March also have high percentages of black voters, so Clinton is likely to have an advantage in them.

Trumps victory was just as significant. In a debate a week before the South Carolina primary, the real estate mogul blasted former president George W. Bush for failing to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks and leading the country into a war with Iraq based on false claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.

In highlighting Bushs foreign policy failures, Trump broke an unwritten rule of GOP politics  that Republicans dont bash Bush for 9/11 or the Iraq War.

And Trump wasnt just facing off with the Bush dynasty. In the days before the primary, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, Gov. Nikki Haley, and U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, perhaps the three most influential Republicans in South Carolina, campaigned for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, illustrating the continuing resistance to Trump among GOP elites.

And unlike New Hampshire, which is full of Trump-style Republicans (more moderate on some issues and non-evangelical), the South Carolina electorate is dominated by Christian conservatives who could have rejected Trump for either his ideology or his New York values, as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz described them earlier in the campaign.

None of that stopped Trump. The real estate mogul was the favorite of South Carolinas moderates, somewhat conservative voters and those without college degrees. He was effectively tied with Cruz among self-described evangelicals and with Rubio among college graduates.

His broad range of support in the Republican electorate suggests major potential for Trump. On Tuesday, March 1, when 12 states will hold primaries or caucuses, its hard to rule out a Trump victory in any of them. He has the potential to win in Alabama, Massachusetts, and Virginia  three radically different states that all vote on Super Tuesday.

Past Republican races have divided the party between a more moderate candidate (McCain, Romney) who won the Northern states and a more conservative one (Huckabee, Santorum, Gingrich) who won states in the South.

Trump may not be limited by that paradigm.

To be sure, Clinton and Trump are far from securing the nominations. Trump will eventually have to run against only one or two rivals, instead of the crowded field that was in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

With ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush opting out of the race after his weak finish in South Carolina, the GOP field is down to just four viable candidates: Cruz, Rubio, Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

For Clinton, her challenger still remains formidable. Sanders, based on the results in the early states, will still have an advantage in largely-white states with lots of liberal voters. For example, on March 1, the Vermont senator may be the favorite in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont.

I believe on Super Tuesday we have an excellent chance to win many of those states, Sanders said on Saturday night.

And there is no guarantee that black voters will stick with Clinton. There is already some evidence in polling that blacks under 45 who for now are still favoring Clinton, are more favorably inclined to Sanders than older blacks.

msnbc,2016-02-20 19:30:00,Accusations of dirty tricks fly in South Carolina,[],"Rumors, lies, and accusations spread like wildfire in South Carolina over the weekend, with the campaigns of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio accusing others of floating false information that their candidates were dropping out and leaving the presidential race.

Rubios campaign pointed fingers at Sen. Ted Cruz, whose team spread similar misleading rumors about Dr. Ben Carson during the Iowa caucuses. Rubio has criticized Cruz widely for these dirty tricks, going as far as to warn voters to be suspicious of calls or news reports they heard during Saturdays primary.

RELATED: Carson: Other campaigns sabotaged us with dirty tricks

In the past 24 hours, Senator Cruz and his allies have flooded South Carolina with false and outrageous lies. Having realized he has run out of positions to flip flop on, Senator Cruz has settled on a strategy to steal elections through rumors and lies, senior Rubio advisor Joe Pounder said in a statement that called on the Texas senator to condemn the rumors. MSNBC was unable to verify that any such calls went out and the Rubio campaign did not respond to requests for proof or voters who had received such calls.

We dont spread rumors, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler replied, adding that they had not distributed information about the Rubio or Bush campaigns to their supporters as they had in Iowa about Carson (though he continued to deny that theyd spread rumors there too.) Flat out false, made up.

Jeb Bushs communications director Tim Miller said on Twitter that reports of rumors about Rubio were made up, and added that Rubios campaign was spreading their own rumors about Bush and Gov. John Kasich. Later in the night, Bush did suspend his campaign, saying the voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada had spoken.

Made up. In fact we have reports of Rubio campaign spreading lies about Jeb & Kasich at precincts on the coast. https://t.co/w4E971xSED  Tim Miller (@Timodc) February 20, 2016

The Bush campaign pointed MSNBC towards a Greenville pastor and retiree, Buddy Simmons, who said he received a call yesterday saying that Bush was leaving the race and encouraging him to vote for Ted Cruz.

They told me you might as well forget Jeb Bush. Hes dropping out on Sunday regardless of what happens, Simmons, 64, told MSNBC, adding that the caller identified himself as a supporter of Ted Cruz. Said hes completely out of money.

Simmons said he voted for Bush anyway, but reached out to find out what was going on and said they told him they believed Rubios campaign was behind the calls.

State Sen. Katrina Shealy, who campaigned for Bush, said she received three calls from constituents asking her if the former Florida governor was dropping out after hearing reports his campaign staff was job-hunting.



Theyre going to polls and nobody wants to vote for somebody thats dropping out the campaign, she said. If people are getting that and theyre not calling me  everybody in the states not going to call me and find that out  thats not good politics.

Jeb is not dropping out after SC & his Staff is not Job Hunting. Another lie from the rivals, Trump, Cruz or Rubio, dont believe the calls  Katrina Shealy (@KatrinaShealy) February 20, 2016

Politico reported on Saturday that Bush staffers were looking for jobs, but the campaign has disputed the report and emphasized again and again that the former governor wasnt leaving the race.

Voters also say the political calls have run amok in the final hours.

My phone rang so many times yesterday I couldnt get anything hardly done, Simmons said, estimating that hed received 50 calls yesterday.

Shealy said shed received as many as 17 phone calls in an hour yesterday and said many of her constituents had complained about them.

Chris Christies administration warned a New Jersey mayor earlier this year that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor, according to the mayor and emails and personal notes she shared with msnbc.

The mayor, Dawn Zimmer, hasnt approved the project, but she did request $127 million in hurricane relief for her city of Hoboken  80% of which was underwater after Sandy hit in October 2012. What she got was $142,000 to defray the cost of a single back-up generator plus an additional $200,000 in recovery grants.

Close video Mayor: Christie camp held Sandy money Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says that top officials in Chris Christies administration have told her that her city will only receive critical Sandy relief funds if she expedites a redevelopment project in north Hoboken. Its not fair for the governor to... embed like save share group

In an exclusive interview, Zimmer broke her silence and named Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, Christies community affairs commissioner, as the two officials who delivered messages on behalf of a governor she had long supported.

The bottom line is, its not fair for the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because he wants me to give back to one private developer, she said Saturday on UP w/ Steve Kornacki. ... I know its very complicated for the public to really understand all of this, but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced development to Hoboken.

Constable and Christie  through spokespersons  deny Zimmers claims.

Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governors Office and the assistance weve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak wrote in a statement. What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyones guess.

Christies office later issued a second statement attacking MSNBC. MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week, spokesman Colin Reed said.

Zimmers statements and documentation suggest that Christies administration  hailed for what seemed like a heroic response to Hurricane Sandy  in fact refused to help some of the neediest.

Id be more than willing to testify under oath and  and answer any questions and provide any documents, take a lie detector test, Zimmer said, referring to the Christie administrations denials. And, you know, my question back to them is, Would all of you? Would all of you be willing do that same thing, to testify under oath, to take a lie detector test?

Zimmers interview comes on the heels of a scandal in which other members of Christies inner circle conspired to create huge traffic swells, possibly in an act of political retribution, on another New Jersey town on the outskirts of Manhattan.

Christie, who sailed to re-election last year and has made no secret of his presidential ambitions, has denied any knowledge of the plot that shut down lanes at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, one of the most heavily trafficked in the country. His office and several former senior aides are currently the subject of a number of federal and state inquiries into what has become known as Bridge-gate.

RELATED: Whos who on the Bridge-gate subpoena list

In this account  supported by email, public records and Zimmers own diary entries  Christies inner circle was willing to cut off devastated constituents, muscle a friendly mayor and arrange public funds to finance a study for a project the governor supported.In a news conference last week, Christie rejected the notion that his administration engages in retribution or seeks political payback. Zimmers account paints a different portrait.

Zimmer claims they leaned on her twice to get their way. By the second encounter, Zimmer said  this time with Constable  the 45-year-old mayor and mother of two young children was despondent, according to her own notes.

I was emotional about governor Christie, she wrote in a diary entry she provided that is dated May 17, 2013. I thought he was honest. I thought he was moral. I thought he was something very different. This week I found out hes cut from the same corrupt cloth that I have been fighting for the last four years.

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told UP Saturday that Zimmers accusations suggest an abuse of power by the Christie administration. This is something that the U.S. attorney should be looking at, and has to be further investigated, he said.

Zimmer and Christie

Among the great ironies in the latest claims about the New Jersey governor is that without Christie, Zimmer would not likely have become the mayor of Hoboken.

What pole-vaulted her to the Mayors Office was a corruption scandal five years ago that enveloped a number of New Jersey politicians, including Zimmers predecessor. The investigation, which netted high profile convictions, was launched by the U.S. Attorneys office then led by Christie. By the time of the arrests in 2009, Christie had already resigned from office to run for governor. But it helped boost his image as tough on corruption and crime.

For Zimmer, it was a welcome sign for New Jerseys future and while she is a Democrat, she became a Christie supporter.

Swept into office from the city council, Zimmer inherited preliminary plans for a redevelopment project supported by the previous mayor.

The deal, as envisioned in 2008, would have awarded the Rockefeller Group  a New York developer  the right to redevelop a stretch of Hoboken. The project would have been eligible for tax incentives and it would have given the Rockefeller Group a much freer hand to build whatever they wanted while asking for millions in subsidies. If done right, it would have been an immensely lucrative deal in a town that has become a hip bedroom community of Manhattan.

Zimmer wasnt against the deal but she wanted a professional study done on the projected development. The problem was that Hobokens finances were in disarray and she wanted to wait until the community was on sounder footing before spending the money for a study.

Zimmer told the Rockefeller Group theyd have to follow the same process as everybody else. That process couldnt start until the city had enough money to pay professionals  planners and engineers  to study the issue.

The sides were at an impasse: the Rockefeller Group had big plans for hugely valuable land but Zimmer wasnt moving forward on it yet.

The dispute became public and thats when the Christie administration came in. Lori Grifa, who in 2010 served as Christies first community affairs commissioner, went to Hoboken that June and told Zimmer the administration might be able to help track down a source to pay for the study.

Soon enough, the Christie administration connected Zimmer to the Port Authority  the same jointly run New Jersey-New York agency that operates the George Washington Bridge, and is littered, on the New Jersey side, with Christies political appointees.

On Dec. 28, 2010, the Port Authority approved a $75,000 grant for the study but there was a catch. The Port Authority alone would choose the firm that conducted the study. In February 2011, it selected Clarke Caton Hintz  a reputable firm  to carry out the redevelopment study. It took a long time: the rest of 2011 and all through 2012, with Hurricane Sandy slowing things down.

Finally, in January 2013, the firm  which was tasked with evaluating a 19-block area  concluded that only the three blocks in which the Rockefeller Group had an ownership stake were fit for redevelopment.

Zimmers team was concerned. The landowners for the other 16 blocks were angry. They hired a lawyer who called the study curious, disturbing and suspect to the say the least.

The Rockefeller Group had its own representation  Wolff & Samson  the most powerful, politically connected law firm in all of New Jersey. Its heavily involved in development deals and its known for its close, intimate ties to the Christie administration. It is the firm of David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority, the former attorney general of New Jersey, and a Christie appointee whos coming under increasing scrutiny in the Bridge-gate scandal.

The firm is also now the professional home of Lori Grifa, the former Christie aide who now lobbies on behalf of the Rockefeller Group.

Our client, The Rockefeller Group, has specifically asked us to speak with you regarding its property in Hoboken, Grifa emailed an attorney employed by Hoboken in early 2012.

Over many months, Grifa kept up the heat on Hoboken, with calls and email pressing for a decision on the project.

By April 5, 2013, Joe Marazati, the Hoboken lawyer, wrote to Zimmers director of community development. I am getting the full court press on this, Marazati wrote in an email. I have a voice mail from last night from Lori asking that I join a call this am with Lori and Dave Samson (chair of the PA) or suggest another time.

Email obtained by msnbc shows a raft of exchanges between the town of Hoboken and the law firm until May 8 when the Hoboken Planning Board voted 4-3 against the project, finding insufficient evidence to designate those three blocks for redevelopment.

Instead, the board declared the entire 19 block area in need of rehabilitation. The designation didnt make it impossible for the Rockefeller Group to get what it wanted but it was a strong signal that Zimmers team wasnt going to roll over for them.

In a statement to msnbc, a spokesman for the Rockefeller Group said: We have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.

Sandy Aid

At the same time that the planning board voted against the study, Zimmer was applying for funding from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a huge vault of money overseen by Christie to help communities hit hard by Sandy prepare themselves for the next storm.

After Sandy hit, in Hobokens darkest hour, Christie came to town and told residents they could count on him.

I spoke to the mayor this morning, and I told her Hoboken is in the front of my mind, and whenever theres any assistance thats needed here, Ill be here to help.

Christies people came back with less than 1% of what Hoboken had sought. With $250 million to disburse statewide, just $142,000 went to Hoboken  enough to help defray the cost of one backup generator to power a flood pump. Out of another pool of money for recovery grants  $1.8 billion in all  Hoboken received $200,000.Hoboken is perched above the mouth of the Hudson River, directly across from lower Manhattan. Following Christies visit, city officials submitted seven letters of intent for around $100 million in funds from programs the state was now running. Among the requests were money for storm surge coastal protection, money to buy properties to be used as open space and money for backup generators.

Please governor, Zimmer wrote in a letter following the decisions, we need your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be treated fairly because you have always treated Hoboken fairly in the past.

There was no response to that letter, dated May 8 of last year, the same day the Hoboken Planning Board did not adopt the redevelopment recommendation for the Rockefeller property.

Two days later, Zimmer got a call from the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Guadagno, who wanted to come to town to do an event at a ShopRite to spotlight businesses that had recovered from the storm.

On May 13, Guadagno and Zimmer met at the Hoboken ShopRite. That is where, Zimmer said, Guadagno delivered the first message about the relief aide.

Zimmer shared this diary entry which she said she wrote later that day. At the end of a big tour of ShopRite and meeting, she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. The word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you. I know its not right  these things should not be connected  but they are, she says, and if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

The second warning, according to Zimmer, came four days later. She and Constable, who now led Christies department of community affairs, were seated together on stage for a for a NJTV public television special on Sandy Recovery.

Again, Zimmer provided this diary entry from May 17, which she said captured the incident.

Lisa M. Ryan, spokeswoman for Constable, said in a statement: Mayor Zimmers allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned Hobokens receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false.

Publicly, Zimmer has not spoken out against either Constable or Christie and the governors office was quick to point to two supportive tweets she wrote about the governor.

In the diary entry she shared, Zimmer concluded with these lines:

My beloved governor who wants to run for President. I cannot understand it. Why is he so concerned about Rockfeller? What has he promised them? What have they promised him? I cannot figure it out but I have no option but to stand up to him.

msnbc,2016-02-20 12:17:00,Photos: South Carolina's Republican presidential primary,['Msnbc Staff'],"Republican presidential candidates have been campaigning across South Carolina in anticipation of the states first-in-the-South GOP primary. With its winner-take-all method of awarding delegates, the Palmetto State holds importance for the rest of the 2016 race: A win here for front-runner Donald Trump would give him a significant lead over his fellow candidates.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll finds that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, however, has cut Trumps advantage down to 5 points. Trump was leading Cruz by 16 points a month ago  the candidates now respectively have 28 percent and 23 percent of support from likely Republican voters in South Carolina. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has 15 percent in the new poll, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush trails him at 13 percent.

Cruz and Rubio have been in a fierce fight over which candidate is the races most conservative, messaging that could tip the scales in favor of one of them in South Carolinas primary.

Bush, along with Rubio, is counting on South Carolina to start a much-needed comeback after a disappointing finish in Iowa and New Hampshire. Hes recently brought his brother, former President George W. Bush, out on the campaign trail in the hopes of inspiring voters.

The primary season has already seen some surprising results  many analysts expected Trump to win Iowas caucuses, but Cruz took home the victory, and John Kasich finished second in New Hampshire.

Im focused on the future, and Im confident that my visit will advance the goals that guide us promoting American interests and values and a better future for the Cuban people, a future of more freedom and more opportunity, the president said in his weekly address. My visit will be an opportunity to keep moving forward. Ill meet with President Castro to discuss how we can continue normalizing relations, including making it easier to trade and easier for Cubans to access the Internet and start their own businesses. Close video Clinton reacts to President Obama's Cuba trip Hillary Clinton emphasizes that it is important for the U.S. President to have a presence in Cuba if the country wants to stress its commitment to human rights. embed like save share group

The White House announced Obamas visit on Thursday, a move that would make him the first sitting American president to travel to Cuba in nearly 90 years. His plan to visit March 21-22 comes more than a year after the Obama administration and Cuba made an agreement to restore diplomatic ties.

The president vowed to speak candidly about our serious differences with the Cuban government, including on democracy and human rights.

Obamas efforts, which have moved toward normalizing relations with the communist country and loosened the U.S. trade embargo, have been rebuked throughout conservative circles, including presidential hopefuls Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz, sons of Cuban immigrants.

The U.S. embargo on Cuba cannot be lifted without congressional approval, unlikely to happen before the president completes his final year in the White House. The current Congress is controlled by Republicans.

The president also used his weekly address to emphasize that American businesses and visitors are helping to build private enterprises in the island nation, and Cubans are getting more access to Wi-Fi hot spots and information from outside the country online.

Ive always said that change wont come to Cuba overnight. But as Cuba opens up, it will mean more opportunity and resources for ordinary Cubans. And were starting to see some progress, said Obama.",[]

When asked by NBCs Chuck Todd to explain what his 2002 comments he said:

Well, what I mean by that is it almost shouldnt have been done. And you know, I really dont even know what I mean, because that was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head. I think that it wasnt done correctly. In retrospect, it [the Iraq War] shouldnt have been done at all.

In the last few weeks, the undisputed front-runner also seemed to flip-flop on his opinion of the womens health care organization Planned Parenthood and whether he supported the health insurance mandate that is a part of Obamacare.

On the subject of federal funding for Planned Parenthood Trump said:

Planned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So Im not going to fund it if its doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it.

And on the health insurance mandate he said he doesnt believe in it but that its still important to take care of people who cant afford health care:

Im really talking about people that cant afford it. Were not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans, okay?

Sergio Pino, an old family friend from Miami, couldnt believe the news. Why did he drop out? Surely there was some way Bush could have pressed on with the campaign?

He was the guy with the most ideas, the most energy, the one guy who took on stupid Donald Trump, he said, his eyes red with tears.



RELATED: Jeb Bush suspends 2016 presidential campaign

In the corner of the hall, a dewy-eyed husband and wife nursed their wine. A few feet away, two crying women embraced. Im so devastated,  one said.

On a narrow level they were watching a failed candidate drop out. But the voters weeping in the hallways knew that this was a broader loss. This was a candidate who stood for an entire generation of Republican Party building, who was the figurative and literal heir to the family brand that had graced nearly every GOP ticket for a generation. And he ceded the race to a candidate whose campaign was a walking middle finger to his family legacy and everything Bushs supporters told themselves the party stood for.

I feel like the Republican Party as I know it suspended its campaign tonight, said Lee Spieckerman, a Texas commentator who had knocked on doors for Bush in New Hampshire and in South Carolina

Bush ran for all the right reasons. He told voters he had a servants heart and, in private and public, his campaign always appeared motivated by duty rather than personal ambition right up to his final speech. He saw a party that had crashed in 2012 by complaining to itself about the Obama administration rather than offering a positive policy agenda that could appeal to voters outside the conservative base, especially Latinos. In his eyes, no one else had the experience or resources to fix the problem. It was up to him.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Jeb Bush At the start of the Republican presidential primary race, former Florida governor Jeb Bush was widely viewed as the establishment candidate to beat.

I dont know if Id be a good candidate or a bad one, Bush said on the precipice of his unofficial campaign launch in December 2014. I kind of know how a Republican can win, whether its me or somebody else  and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more wiling to be, lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.

You could see his sense of duty mainly in how unhappy he often looked running. By Bushs own account, he was an introvert forcing himself through a gauntlet that rewarded tireless backslapping extroverts. In contrast to rigidly disciplined rivals like Rubio and Cruz, he kept his feelings in plain sight. When things went badly  and they did, early and often  the frustration poured out.

What went wrong? The easiest explanation  which has the benefit of being true  is that Bushs problems started with his last name.

The entire rest of the campaign: His disconnect with the base, his failure to put down rival upstarts, his clashes with Donald Trump, his inability to turn spending into votes, were to some degree tributaries flowing from the family river.

Bush entered an environment dominated by the tea party movement that had grown up after his brother left office and defined itself primarily by its angry opposition to core planks of his brothers candidacy: Bailouts, expanding the safety net, passing immigration reform, intervening in education. This movement would power candidates like Senator Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who spoke its language more naturally than Bush. At the same time, the damage left over by his financial collapse that occurred in the waning days of his brothers presidency would help fuel an unfocused populism that would power Trump.

He was a great candidate, Spieckerman said. He just ran in the wrong end of the decade.

RELATED: Bush supporters left to consider other candidates

The campaign always knew the Bush family legacy would be a problem. In the early days of the race, Bush said he was my own man when it came to policy and pledged to show my heart even as he steadfastly praised his brother and father.

He began with considerable advantages. He had spent two terms as a popular conservative governor in Florida. His family and personal connections gave him access to an unprecedented fundraising machine that would raise well north of $100 million for his super PAC.

These advantages helped him muscle out an early obstacle in Mitt Romney, who considered a run, but even from the beginning potential rivals sensed weakness. Those suspicions that Bush was mortal were confirmed when he stumbled out the gate over the single most predictable issue surrounding his family, the Iraq War, which he struggled to take a position on before conceding it was a mistake.

Senator Marco Rubio, his old acquaintance from Florida, decided to run even though Bush took the lion share of his donors and endorsements. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker saw an opening as a conservative alternative to Bush. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie threw his hat in the ring despite his own weaknesses. Ohio Governor John Kasich decided to give it whirl. Others like Texas Governor Rick Perry and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal hopped in. Before long, it was the deepest field anyone could remember.

And then, a whole six months into Bushs unofficial run for the presidency, came the one absolutely no one had expected: Donald Trump.

view photo essay Photos: South Carolina's Republican presidential primary Republican presidential candidates have been campaigning across the Palmetto State in anticipation of its first-in-the-South GOP primary.

Trump took off like wildfire running against rapists and criminals coming in across the border, the polar opposite of Bushs message of immigration reform and compassion for undocumented immigrants, who he said came primarily as an act of love.

Yet Bush hesitated to engage him. It seems crazy to imagine now, but the assumption among the pundit class and the Bush campaign alike, was that Trumps arrival was a good thing. It would prevent other candidates from gaining traction before eventually imploding like Trumps birther-fueled dress rehearsal had in 2011, leaving Bush to swoop in with superior resources and head into the general election as the guy whod exorcised the partys nativist demons.

He was partly right. Trump utterly devoured coverage of the race and he blocked out many of Bushs rivals. Walker, who seemed like a frontrunner himself at one point, was soon gone. Others would follow. But Bush failed to pick up their support as they collapsed. If anything, he kept dropping.

Meanwhile, Trump was on TV 24/7, calling into shows, having his rallies carried live, giving exclusives to conservative outlets, and tweeting away and his favorite target was low energy mamas boy Bush. He was the perfect foil for Trump, who pitched himself as a lone incorruptible man of the people whose money insulated him from special interests while candidates like Bush were bought off by millionaire super PAC donors.

Summer turned to fall and Trump continued to suck the entire campaign into his orbit. As the insults piled up, Bush looked smaller and smaller and he eventually changed course and began to respond to Trump directly.

Donald Trumps view is that the end is near, Bush told a town hall audience in New Hampshire during his anti-Trump kickoff in September. His pessimistic view is lets close the borders, lets create tariffs, lets do this, lets do that all based on negativity and the net result is that all of us will suffer if that philosophy gains favor.

When he was finished, a voter stood up and offered a telling response: We are pissed off right now.

RELATED: Jeb Bush wouldnt join a Donald Trump ticket

The dynamic was deadly. It kept Bush from getting his message out, but in the Bush campaigns eyes it also meant the tougher candidates still in the race avoided sustained negative coverage as attention as voters eyes stayed glued to Trump.

Trump blocked out the sun for seven months, one Bush aide said on Saturday. None of the other candidates got the scrutiny they would have otherwise in that period.

Bush held out hope through the fall that the race was still just a show. He told reporters to wait until his super PAC, Right to Rise, started spending its nine-figure budget on ads.

They did. Nothing happened. At the same time, Bushs ongoing weakness created a major opening for candidates like Rubio and, within New Hampshire, Kasich and Christie, to make the case that it was time for someone else to rescue the establishment.

With Rubio rising, Bush finally was forced to go negative in October and started criticizing his rival over his lack of experience  he said the senator followed [his] lead in the statehouse.

But Bush was never comfortable going on offense and it showed. The confrontation came to a head at the debate and when Bush raised the issue of his attendance, the younger politician eviscerated him.

At that point the die was cast and Bush was stuck with the loser label. He would never shake it off for the duration of the race, despite an unprecedented spending campaign to do just that.

Bush and the outside groups supporting him spent almost $81 million in TV ads over the race, according to ad tracker SMG Delta. They drooped $36 million on their must-win target New Hampshire  far more than any candidate  yet finished fourth and were happy to make it that far.

Along the way, they received a hefty share of criticism from Republicans for using their cash primarily to target rivals like Rubio, Christie, and Kasich rather than Trump, who by then even critics acknowledged was the obvious front-runner. Bushs campaign always thought this was unfair  after all, its not like anyone else in the race, including Rubio, was setting the world on fire while Bush languished. Nor were they attacking Trump much either, electing to avoid his withering gaze and try to steal each others voters as long as they possibly could.

Now Bush has ceded the field to others to mount their last minute counteroffensive and his supporters grappling with cold hard reality. The man who seemed their white knight turned into a dark horse and then a dead horse and the man who beat him remains, carrying the four horsemen of the old GOPs apocalypse behind him.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-16 15:19:00,"Chiropractor may be able to crackdown on NFL head, neck injuries",[],"While the NFL remains preoccupied with severe head injuries, one innovative chiropractor thinks the organization has overlooked a crucial component: the neck.

Dr. Patrick Kerr, who played as a linebacker as a youth and remains an avid football fan, believes that the league has put too much emphasis on trying to reduce violent tackles, instead of looking at how to diminish their impact. Over a decade ago, he created the Kerr collar to protect players necks, which has already found widespread success in college football. A biomechanical analysis by the Virginia Tech Center for Injury Biomechanics showed that the Kerr collar, tested against two other similar collars, greatly reduces both the force trauma to the neck (by 58 percent in at least one impact position, according to Kerr) and how far the head moves during a collision (by 38 percent). Ultimately, this could mean less damage to brain stems.

I really believe were not looking at football the way we should, Kerr told MSNBC on Tuesday. Were looking at trying to avoid it as a collision sport. This is a collision sport.

He says that while he believes that the NFL is sincere in their efforts to address player safety, they may be overthinking the problem  and the issue isnt just confined to the pro leagues.

Its not really about the NFL. Its about football ... football cant sustain this, he said.

RELATED: Ken Stablers posthumous CTE diagnosis overshadows Super Bowl

Kerr believes that a concerted effort must be made to better educate parents and athletes at the high school and middle school level, where a disproportionate number of cataclysmic injuries occur. Beyond the recent spike in concussions in the NFL, at least two college players were paralyzed and six high school players died due to the effects of on-the-field injuries last year alone. And more than 100 have died in the past decade, according to the University of North Carolinas National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.

In the wake of the Will Smith film Concussion, the high profile posthumous diagnoses of the neurological disorder CTE in former players, and the premature retirement of NFL stars due to concerns over lingering injuries, its clear that the NFL, which has never been more popular, could have a crisis on its hands. Kerr believes that right now NFL owners with deep pockets, like the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones, could easily equip all of their states local high schools and colleges with his collars at minimal cost, but there needs to be a serious evolution in thinking. For instance, its mandatory across the board that football players wear a mouth-guard, why not institute better neck protection as well?

There is a lot of very intelligent, brilliant people trying to solve this problem and there are a lot of people who are not so smart, directly related to kids, he said. While some sports fans might dismiss pro athletes as overpaid men who have made a conscious choice to put their bodies and minds on the line, Kerr believes there should be more sympathy for young people whose bodies are still developing and who may stand no chance at a professional football career. And for those young players who do have a shot, the NFL doesnt want to see possible future superstars pursuing careers in soccer or track instead.

According to Kerr, his collar is now in use in up to 70 percent of college football programs, and a handful of NFL players have begun using it, too. He is meeting next month with an engineering committee spearheaded by the NFL to seek funding for research to discover if it also prevents brain injuries.

The NFL could be very instrumental in making football safer. [People ask] What havent they? My answer is theyre going to. The resistance he faces comes from what Kerr describes as footballs old guard, which looks down on equipment like his because they want to preserve an image of invincibility. In particular, he laments the fact that parents often encourage their children put themselves at risk for short term glory.

Youre asking the human body to do something its not designed to do, he said.

Still, despite the numerous patients hes seen whove sustained serious injury through the game of football, and the proliferation of former stars who have revealed neurological damage before and after death, Kerr still remains an avid fan of the sport. As a young man, he believes the game provided him with comradeship, a healthy outlet for his aggression and life lessons that shaped who he is today.

Ive gotten so much from football, he said. It made me a stronger man. But he still believes that we must be doing more to protect kids just coming up in the game, or it wont have a future. He added: There is not a magic bullet here with football. But if your goal is to make football safer, this is a really good step.",[]

The somber ceremony at Washington D.C.s Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, North Americas largest Roman Catholic church, was led by one of Scalias nine children, Paul Scalia, a Catholic priest.

Close video Judge shares memories of Scalia Federal Judge Martin Feldman and close friend of Justice Antonin Scalia shares memories and stories of how Scalia affected his life. embed like save share group He understood there is no conflict between loving God and loving ones country, ones faith and public service, the Rev. Scalia said during his homily for the elder Scalia, who after a history of heart problems died a week ago at age 79.

God blessed him with a desire to be the countrys good servant because he was Gods (servant) first, the Rev. Scalia added.

Scalias body laid in a coffin draped with a white patterned cloth. In the audience, the sea of mourners included D.C. political powerbrokers and dignitaries, such as Vice President Joe Biden, the current Supreme Court justices and two retired justices, John Paul Stevens and David Souter.

Earlier in the Mass, Justice Clarence Thomas, who shared in Scalias judicial opinions, gave a reading from the New Testaments Book of Romans.

The Rev. Scalias voice broke quietly as he spoke of his fathers love for his wife of 55 years, Maureen, and the children they raised in their large Italian-American household.

Sure, he forgot our names at times or mixed them up, but there are nine of us, Scalia said to laughter. He loved us, and sought to show that love and sought to share the blessing of the faith he treasured. And he gave us one another, to have each other for support. Thats the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now, were particularly grateful for it.

The younger Scalia also shared a humorous and heartfelt tale about when his father went to confession one Saturday while his son was there. Close video Scalias son tells lighthearted story at funeral Rev. Paul Scalia delivers a personal anecdote about a time when devout Catholic Justice Antonin Scalia ended up in his confessional line. embed like save share group

The Roman (Catholic) collar was not a shield against his criticism, the Rev. Scalia said. The issue was that he had found himself in my confessional line and he quickly departed it. As he put it later, Like heck if Im confessing to you. The feeling was mutual.

Scalias homily hinted at a parallel between Scalia, one of the high courts most colorful and conservative justices, and Jesus, whom he described as a man loved by many, scorned by others.

Jesus, the Rev. Scalia said, was known for great controversy and for great compassion.

Scalias unexpected death on Feb. 13 at a Texas hunting resort stunned the nation and brought the future of the courts ideological makeup into question.

Scalia, as the Supreme Courts conservative leader, was an outspoken judge when he joined the court in 1986 as a President Ronald Reagan nominee.

His off-the-cuff remarks outside and inside the court rankled many for his stances on gay rights, affirmative action and immigration.

When President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015, Scalia struck back at the majoritys ruling as pure applesauce and interpretive jiggery-pokery.

A White House spokesman had said the decision to not include the president was a respectful arrangement because of the large security detail Obama would require.

Obama has said he plans to pick a replacement for Scalias seat before his presidential term ends this year  leading many prominent Republicans to demand he wait because its an election year.

Biden, who had a personal relationship with the Scalia family as a fellow Catholic, represented the White House at the funeral.

The ceremony was a first for a Supreme Court justice at the blue-domed Basilica of the National Shrine, which can hold at least 3,500 people. Last September, Pope Francis conducted a Mass at the basilicas grounds.

At the end of the Mass, Scalias casket was covered in an American flag and carried by pallbearers down the churchs front steps. He was set to be buried at a site undisclosed publicly by the court.

Many former justices are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

msnbc,2015-03-10 14:04:00,Where Are They Now: Hangover Heaven,['Jessica Shim'],"For most, a hangover is the consequence of one too many drinks. But for Dr. Jason Burke, it was the start of a new business.

In March 2013, Your Business traveled to the Sin City to talk shop with Dr. Jason Burke, founder and CEO of Hangover Heaven. The company uses IV hydration, vitamins, and other medications to treat patients suffering from hangover symptoms. Dr. Burke, a board-certified anesthesiologist with a medical degree from the University of North Carolina, says he can treat almost 95 percent of all hangover symptoms in about 45 minutes.

In an effort to make its services as convenient and readily available as possible, the company turned an old gospel tour bus into a mobile treatment facility. Hangover Heaven also provides shuttle service to their clinic, and offers in-room treatment options.

But that doesnt mean the business has been welcomed with open arms. Some question whether or not a hangover is a medical condition that needs to be treated. To tackle that hurdle, Dr. Burke created the Hangover Research Institute to gather scientific evidence to back his claims and regularly asks clients to post on social media about their experiences.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER

According to Hangover Heaven, the company saw a 40-percent increase in 2014 revenue year over year, and expects revenue to grow in 2015 as well. Hangover Heaven has found the greatest growth in private, in-hotel-room treatment plans, thanks to the relationships it has forged with concierge services at major hotels on the Strip. Dr. Burke says his company is often called to VIP rooms to provide treatment, and recalls one instance when, after providing treatment for a VIP client, the client felt so much better that he extended his trip to Vegas an extra day.

Hangover Heaven has also expanded its clinic to make room for a designated space for the Hangover Research Institute. It continues to conduct research on hangovers and ways to treat the symptoms head on.

Dr. Burke continues to receive requests to expand his business into other cities across the globe, and is seriously considering expanding the company into other locales.",[]

With each worker clutching a boxed lunch in one hand and a mini American flag in the other, they swept past their hotels iconic fountain to the casino next door.

For a few short minutes, the matching outfits of bachelorette parties and tourist groups that typically flood the Las Vegas strip were drowned out by the uniforms of bartenders, maids and casino dealers who clocked out for a few short hours to participate in the Democratic caucus.

Full coverage of the race for the White House: Decision 2016

Going into Saturday, the race in Nevada was down to the wire, marking a key test on whether Hillary Clinton could maintain her lock on support from minority voters or Bernie Sanders insurgency campaign could carry him through Super Tuesday.

Nevada is the first state where minority voters could play a pivotal role in determining which candidate will be the next Democratic nominee. Crucially, 75 percent of registered Democrats live in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, making Sin City the hotbed of overall turnout for the race.

The Nevada Democratic Party set up six caucus locations on the Las Vegas strip to accommodate shift workers at the hotels and casinos so they dont have to travel to their home precincts to participate.

The caucus location inside the ballroom at Caesars Palace was rapturous with activity as competing chants worked to overpower the other.

Hill-Ar-Y! and then Feel the Bern!

A cavalry of Sanders supporters from the National Nurses Union came in from across the country in a show of solidarity after canvassing Las Vegas homes for weeks.

I was pleasantly surprised there was a lot of Bernie support, Teresz Lozoya, a volunteer with the union, said. More than that, even, there was a lot of non-support for Hillary.

Throughout the week, both candidates have worked the hotel circuits, shaking hands with housekeepers and casino hands during their breaks, with Clinton hitting Caesars Palace three times in as many days.

Jimmy Leon, who started working at Caesars more than 20 years ago, beginning as a dishwasher and working his way up to become a chef in Gordon Ramsays restaurant, was one of the workers who waited in line hours before the caucus to meet both Clintons in the employee break room.

He got a selfie with Hillary and shook Bill Clintons hand.

Bill Clinton is a very good president. Maybe she has the same ideas, Leon said.

Raquel Reyes was devastated that she couldnt leave her shift on the buffet floor at Caesars to run back and meet the Clintons on Saturday morning. A first-time caucus-goer, Reyes was too young to participate in 2008. But she wanted Clinton to win back then, too.

His comments were made as the Syrian opposition said it had agreed to the possibility of a temporary truce, provided there were guarantees Damascuss allies including Russia would cease fire, sieges were lifted and aid deliveries were allowed country-wide.

We have said that we are ready to stop military operations, but the issue relates to more important factors ... such as preventing terrorists from using it to improve their positions, Assad told Spanish newspaper El Pais in an interview.

RELATED: Syria cease-fire: Provisional agreement reached, John Kerry says

He also said any truce must ensure that other countries, especially Turkey, are prevented from sending more terrorists and weapons, or any kind of logistical support.

Damascus refers to all insurgents fighting against the Syrian army and its allies as terrorists.

Turkey, other Sunni regional powers and Western countries have supported insurgents fighting against Assad, whose forces are bolstered by Iran, Russia and Lebanese Hezbollah.

Asked about the possibility of Turkey and Saudi Arabia sending ground forces into Syria, Assad said: Were going to deal with them like we deal with the terrorists. Were going to defend our country. This is aggression.

Attempts to negotiate a truce in recent months have failed. The latest round of talks at the United Nations in Geneva is being jointly chaired by Russia and the United States.

World powers agreed in Munich on Feb. 12 to a cessation of hostilities that would let humanitarian aid be delivered in Syria.

The ceasefire was scheduled to start a week later, but did not take effect. Syrian army offensives continue unabated across the country, backed by Russian air strikes.

Assad said last week he would keep fighting terrorism while peace talks took place, vowing to retake the whole country.

He told El Pais his troops were now close to fully controlling the northern city of Aleppo and were advancing towards the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa province.

Once he has control of the country, Assad also said in the interview, the next step would be to form a national unity government that would lay the groundwork for a new constitution and general elections.

State leaders hail Nevadas demographics as a microcosm of the U.S. electorate: Increasingly diverse as minority voters inch toward becoming the majority, with Latinos carrying the torch as the fastest growing bloc of the electorate.

Just a few short months ago, it would have come as complete shock to see how down to the wire Nevadas Democratic caucus would be.

The major question question heading into Saturdays race is whether Hillary Clintons firewall of support from blacks and Latinos will be able to hold against the insurgency of Bernie Sanders campaign, built from the ground up.

Clinton came to Nevada early and hard, setting up an expansive ground game statewide before Sanders had even formally entered the race.

Her roots in the Silver State must not be underestimated. She won the popular vote in 2008  claiming key support from Latinos  only to be edged out by then-Sen. Barack Obama on the delegate count.

But riding off a virtual tie in Iowa and a win in New Hampshire by a more than 20-point spread, Sanders approaches Nevada with momentum at his back.

Days out from the Nevada caucus, polls showed Sanders whittling Clintons lead down to just a single percentage point.

On the eve of caucus day, Sanders stood with confidence before a rapturous crowd of fans and declared that 20, 30 years from now, they will look back and say this is when the revolution began.

I have a feeling, folks, that were going to make history tomorrow, Sanders said.

A stretch of low pressure associated with the same winter storm was wreaking havoc from Louisiana to Alabama, the Weather Channel reported, with possible tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hail and powerful wind gusts leaving thousands without power.

Much of the region was still shivering after a bitter blast of arctic air brought record-smashing temperatures to several cities over the weekend.

The freeze was joined by snow Sunday, with up to a foot expected through Tuesday from western Pennsylvania to northern New England, according to The Weather Channel. 

Freezing rain, ice and lesser snow accumulations were also anticipated across much of the Eastern Seaboard, with a blanket of winter storm warnings and freezing rain advisories in effect from Georgia to Maine.

Snow was also forecast in Michigan.

In Virginia, one person was killed on Monday morning after an SUV collided with a snow plow, the Weather Channel reported , while in Minnesota, slick roads caused dozens of spin-outs and two fatal accidents on Sunday night.

North of Boston, the coastal community of Revere was grappling with severe flooding: the citys floodgates were left open during the polar vortex, and frozen solid by the blast of arctic air, NBC affiliate WHDH reported.

When high tide arrived, water spilled onto the streets and surged under raised homes, creating a sheet of ice that froze pipes and sent residents to hotels, the station reported.

In Mississippi, at least two tornadoes were reported, the Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Forbes reported,and 14,000 people were in the dark,according to NBC affiliate WLBT. More than an inch of hail fell north of Baton Rouge, the Weather Channel reported, and the roof was blown off a Pizza Hut in the central part of Louisiana.

As of 2:30 pm ET, nearly 4,000 flights had been delayed or canceled across the nation. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Newark Liberty and Baltimore-Washington were the worst affected, suffering nearly 1,000 cancellations and delays, according to Flight Aware.

The snow looked likely to be short-lived in the East, however, with much of it turning to rain overnight and temperatures expected to spike to the mid-50s in Boston by Tuesday, the Weather Channel reported.

Cold weather records across the Northeast were shattered on Valentines Day after the polar vortex shot a mass of Canadian arctic air south.

Valentines Day saw temperature records tumble across the region. In Boston, thermometers dipped to minus 9 degrees  the coldest day since Jan. 15, 1957  while in New York City, Central Park registered minus 1, the lowest reading in 22 years.

Monday looked likely to be warmer  but only just  with lows between 10 to 20 degrees below average and subzero temperatures already recorded across New England in the early hours of the morning.

msnbc,2016-02-21 13:14:00,"Decision 2016: Front-runners get major wins, solidify their advantages ahead of Super Tuesday",['Perry Bacon Jr'],"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have now won two of the first three races in their respective primaries and caucuses, putting the two front-runners in very strong positions heading to March, when more than two dozen states will hold primaries or caucuses.

For Clinton, the Nevada victory is an important turnabout after her 22-point drubbing against Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. She is a heavy favorite to win South Carolinas Jan. 27 primary, which would mean the former secretary of state had won three of the first four contests in the Democratic race.

Clintons win in Nevada came in part because of her substantial advantage among black voters, who favored her 76 percent to 22 percent, according to exit polls.

In polls, African-Americans in South Carolina are backing her by a similarly enormous margin.

Looking forward, many of the states that will vote in March also have high percentages of black voters, so Clinton is likely to have an advantage in them.

Trumps victory was just as significant. In a debate a week before the South Carolina primary, the real estate mogul blasted former president George W. Bush for failing to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks and leading the country into a war with Iraq based on false claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.

In highlighting Bushs foreign policy failures, Trump broke an unwritten rule of GOP politics  that Republicans dont bash Bush for 9/11 or the Iraq War.

And Trump wasnt just facing off with the Bush dynasty. In the days before the primary, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, Gov. Nikki Haley, and U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, perhaps the three most influential Republicans in South Carolina, campaigned for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, illustrating the continuing resistance to Trump among GOP elites.

And unlike New Hampshire, which is full of Trump-style Republicans (more moderate on some issues and non-evangelical), the South Carolina electorate is dominated by Christian conservatives who could have rejected Trump for either his ideology or his New York values, as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz described them earlier in the campaign.

None of that stopped Trump. The real estate mogul was the favorite of South Carolinas moderates, somewhat conservative voters and those without college degrees. He was effectively tied with Cruz among self-described evangelicals and with Rubio among college graduates.

His broad range of support in the Republican electorate suggests major potential for Trump. On Tuesday, March 1, when 12 states will hold primaries or caucuses, its hard to rule out a Trump victory in any of them. He has the potential to win in Alabama, Massachusetts, and Virginia  three radically different states that all vote on Super Tuesday.

Past Republican races have divided the party between a more moderate candidate (McCain, Romney) who won the Northern states and a more conservative one (Huckabee, Santorum, Gingrich) who won states in the South.

Trump may not be limited by that paradigm.

To be sure, Clinton and Trump are far from securing the nominations. Trump will eventually have to run against only one or two rivals, instead of the crowded field that was in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

With ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush opting out of the race after his weak finish in South Carolina, the GOP field is down to just four viable candidates: Cruz, Rubio, Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

For Clinton, her challenger still remains formidable. Sanders, based on the results in the early states, will still have an advantage in largely-white states with lots of liberal voters. For example, on March 1, the Vermont senator may be the favorite in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont.

I believe on Super Tuesday we have an excellent chance to win many of those states, Sanders said on Saturday night.

And there is no guarantee that black voters will stick with Clinton. There is already some evidence in polling that blacks under 45 who for now are still favoring Clinton, are more favorably inclined to Sanders than older blacks.

The expected move comes one day after the presidential contenders lackluster finish in the South Carolina Republican primary, in which Kasich placed fifth with 8 percent out of the six viable candidates.

While the piece of legislation, known as House Bill 294, does not mention Planned Parenthood specifically, supporters say the organization would be affected most by the bill. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio launched digital advertisements and videos against the governor earlier this week when the bill was sent to his desk.

The measure targets about $1.3 million in funds that Planned Parenthood receives via the states Department of Health. The funding, which largely comes from federal sources, covers cancer screenings, HIV testing and initiatives to prevent domestic violence, but the legislation would forbid funding institutions that are affiliated with abortion. Under the bill, Ohios health department must ensure that state funds and certain federal funds are not used either to perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions, or to contract or affiliate with any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions, according to a statement from Kasichs office.

Kasich signed a state budget in 2013 that reduced funding to Planned Parenthood and has signed at least 16 pieces of anti-abortion legislation since he assumed the governorship in 2011.

msnbc,2014-02-16 08:10:00,Another Christie childhood friend witnessed traffic surge,[],"On Sunday, the Port Authoritys executive director Pat Foye issued an investigation into the new report that a Port Authority police officer, with personal ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, was at the George Washington Bridge when access lanes were closed last September. A new paper trail indicates the officer drove David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who supervised the closings, on a tour of the area as traffic brought it to a standstill.

Foye requested the agencys inspector general investigate the reported actions of police officers who were at the bridge during the lane closures, according to a source close to the Police Department.

Documents submitted to a New Jersey legislative committee by Wildstein also show that the officer, Lieutenant Thomas Chip Michaels, appears to have sent periodic text messages to Wildstein updating him on the effects of the lane closures and their crippling impact on the town of Fort Lee. In one message, on the first day of the lane closures, Michaels told Wildstein he might have an idea to make this better. It is not clear what he meant.

Michaels, who joined the Port Authority Police Department in 1998 according to payroll records, grew up in Christie and Wildsteins hometown of Livingston, N.J. In recent years, he coached Christies son at little league hockey. Michaels brother, Jeffrey Michaels is among the most powerful Republicans in New Jersey politics  a lobbyist whose practice has soared in value during the Christie years and who has donated heavily to pro-Christie organizations.

Michaels presence at the lane closures with Wildstein is an important new detail because it places another person with long-time ties to the governor, this time in the Port Authority Police Department, at the scene witnessing the traffic surge that has since come to engulf Chrsties administration in legal inquires.

The revelation is also important because Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich had earlier questioned the Port Authority Police Departments actions during the closures. In a September 12 letter, Sokolich wrote to Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee who has since resigned, that residents had told him that Port Authority Police Officers are advising commuters in response to their complaints that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the Mayor, recently made. There is no evidence that Michaels was one of these officers.

In a statement released Monday, the Christie administration said the governor has never had any conversations with either Jeff or Chip Michaels on this topic. Christie emphatically denies taking part in or having any knowledge of the decision to close the lanes leading onto one of the busiest bridge in the world. He has said he doesnt know why members of his inner circle would have ordered the lanes closed.

After e-mails surfaced last month revealing his top aides discussed and apparently took part in the lane closures, Christie fired his deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and cut ties with Bill Stepien, one of his top political lieutenants. Wildstein, who served as director of interstate capital projects, resigned from the Port Authority in December. In a recent letter to the Authority, Wildsteins lawyer asserted that evidence exists showing that Christie knew of the lane closures while they were happening.

The governors office, Christies reelection campaign, and multiple top aides have been subpoenaed by the state legislative committee investigating the lane closures. A separate inquiry is underway at the U.S. Attorneys office, which is looking into the lane closures and also into allegations made by the mayor of Hoboken, N.J., that Christie officials threatened to withhold Sandy relief money from her city unless she moved forward with a redevelopment project represented by the law firm of one of Christies top political allies, Port Authority Chairman David Samson. The Governors office has denied any linkage between the project and Sandy money.

In 2010, a Newark Star-Ledger article described the Christie-Michaels family friendship as one that has endured for decades.

We break his chops a little bit, just saying, Youre the Governor?, looking at him laughing, Chip Michaels told the paper. Its crazy. He grew up like everyone else in New Jersey. So to see him as a celebrity, its just really odd. But hes the same guy. Hes a grounded guy. At the time the article was published, Michaels was coaching one of Christies sons in a youth hockey league. The article described a friendship dating back to their childhoods.

Multiple attempts to reach Chip Michaels directly and through the Port Authority were unsuccessful. The Port Authority Police Department has not returned calls for comment. Messages and emails sent to Jeffrey Michaels were not responded to.

Chip Michaels presence at the bridge at the time of the lane closures came to light during a review of documents that were subpoenaed by the New Jersey State Assemblys Transportation Committee late last year and released publicly in early January.

It was previously known that Wildstein and Robert Durando, the general manager of the George Washington Bridge, were present when the lane closures went into effect at 6:00 A.M. on September 9. In testimony before the Transportation Committee last December, Durando said that Wildstein had also met up with a Port Authority police lieutenant to tour the area.

He [Wildstein] came to the facility on Monday morning, Durando testified. He stood at the communications desk for a little while  its an area with cameras to look out at the various roadways  limited view, albeit. He stayed there for a little while. He then left the facility, left the communications desk with a police lieutenant assigned to the George Washington Bridge, to ride around the facility for some period of time to see the impact on traffic.

Among Wildsteins subpoenaed documents from that morning is a text message exchange with someone offering to pick him up in the parking lot at the Port Authority offices at the bridge. Wildstein replied: Im with Bob which presumably refers to Robert Durando. In the exchange, Wildstein told the person  whose identity was redacted by Wildsteins lawyer  that he would be ready around 7:30.

In an email sent at 7:28am, which was also was included in subpoenaed materials, Wildstein informed Durando that he was leaving to take a ride with Chip, seemingly indicating that Chip Michaels was the person Wildstein had been texting with earlier.

The night before the closures went into effect, documents show that Chip Michaels emailed his superior, Captain Darcy Licorish, to ask if a new traffic pattern was going into effect the following morning. From the redactions in the documents Wildstein shared, it appears he and Michaels had previously been exchanging text messages on a possibly unrelated matter.

On the first morning of the lane closures, text messages appear to show Michaels telling Wildstein before they went for their ride-around, that its [expletive] up here. Then, at 8:46am  approximately 75 minutes after they had apparently left for their ride-around on the bridge  Michaels tested Wildstein that I may hav idea to mak ths beter (sic). The next morning, just before 9:00am, Michaels texted Wildstein again. Local ft lee traffic disaster.

Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul told msnbc that Michaels was one of three Port Authority Police officials he reached out to on the morning of the lane closures as he unsuccessfully tried to contain the impact on the area.

Michaels brother Jeffrey Michaels served as the chief of staff to Republican Gov. Donald DiFrancesco just over a decade ago before transitioning into lobbying. When Christie ran for governor in 2009, Jeffrey Michaels served as a campaign adviser. According to journalist Bob Ingles 2012 biography of Christie, it was Jeffrey Michaels who delivered the good news to Christie on election night that he had won.

In a public television interview after that election, Jeffrey Michaels was asked how close he is to Christie. Ive known him for a long time, he said. We went to high school with  we  our families knew each other from Livingston, and just stayed in close contact with him over the years and was very pleased to help his campaign out with policy.

Once Christie became governor, Jeffrey Michaels newly-created lobbying venture flourished. Teaming up with Phil Norcross  who is the brother of George Norcross, the preeminent Democratic power-broker in the state and a not-so-secret ally of Christies  Jeffrey Michaels launched Optimus Partners L.L.C. In just one year his lobbying revenue increased by a factor of seven, according to a 2011 report in Philadelphia Inquirer.

Attempts to reach Jeffrey Michaels through his office were unsuccessful. Local reports and I.R.S. filings show that Jeffrey Michaels has donated extensively to pro-Christie groups, including $25,000 to a PAC created to push the governors agenda and $20,450 since October 2012 to the Republican Governors Association, the organization Christie is now heading as he explores a possible 2016 presidential bid.",[]

The new study finds not only that more Americans are taking the drugs, which include brand names such as Valium and Xanax, but that theyre taking more of them.

But while the quantity of prescriptions filled tripled between 1996 and 2013, the number of overdoses quadrupled during the same period, the team reported in the American Journal of Public Health.

We found that the death rate from overdoses involving benzodiazepines, also known as benzos, has increased more than four-fold since 1996  a public health problem that has gone under the radar, said Dr. Marcus Bachhuber of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who helped lead the study.

Overdoses from benzodiazepines have increased at a much faster rate than prescriptions for the drugs, indicating that people have been taking them in a riskier way over time.

Benzodiazepines are extremely popular drugs in the U.S.

More than 5 percent of U.S. adults fill a benzodiazepine prescription every year, for conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders and insomnia.

Theyre known to be highly addictive and, in 2013, nearly a third of the 23,000 people who died from prescription drug overdoses were taking them.

Bachhubers team looked at large health surveys to find trends in their use and abuse.

The rate of overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines increased more than four-fold from 0.58 per 100,000 adults to 3.07 per 100 000 adults, they wrote. However, this rate appeared to plateau after 2010.

Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling a benzodiazepine prescription increased 67 percent, from 8.1 million to 13.5 million, they added.

They found a similarly large increase in the number of pills each adult was prescribed.

Its not clear why overdoses went up so much. It could be people are taking the drugs for longer times, raising the odds that theyll eventually overdose. Or it could be the pills are getting to people who dont have prescriptions, the researchers wrote.

Using some of his strongest words ever against capital punishment, he also called on Catholic politicians worldwide to make a courageous and exemplary gesture by seeking a moratorium on executions during the Churchs current Holy Year, which ends in November.

I appeal to the consciences of those who govern to reach an international consensus to abolish the death penalty, he told tens of thousands of people in St. Peters Square.

The commandment You shall not kill, has absolute value and applies to both the innocent and the guilty, he told the crowd.

The 1.2 billion-member Catholic Church allowed the death penalty in extreme cases for centuries, but the position began to change under the late Pope John Paul, who died in 2005.

The pope added that there was now a growing opposition to the death penalty even for the legitimate defense of society because modern means existed to efficiently repress crime without definitively denying the person who committed it the possibility of rehabilitating themselves.

Francis made the comments to throw his weight behind an international conference against the death penalty starting Monday in Rome and organized by the SantEgidio Community, a worldwide Catholic peace and justice group.

Francis, who has visited a number of jails since his election as pope nearly three years ago - the latest in Mexico last week - also called for better prison conditions.

All Christians and men of good will are called on to work not only for the abolition of the death penalty, but also to improve prison conditions so that they respect the human dignity of people who have been deprived of their freedom, he said.

In the past, the pope also denounced life imprisonment, calling it a hidden death penalty and saying that more should be done to try to rehabilitate even the most hardened of criminals.

msnbc,2016-02-18 19:19:00,Mysteries of the Zika virus stump even the experts,['Maggie Fox'],"Zika virus shows up in urine, saliva and semen. And it seems to go right to the brain in fetuses, but nowhere else in their bodies.

So its no wonder this once-obscure virus is mystifying even the experts.

Zika is spreading explosively across Latin America and the Caribbean. The islands of Bonaire and Aruba are the latest to report local spread, according to Marcos Espinal of the Pan American Health Organization.

Such rapid movement is not unexpected when a new virus  in this case, spread by an extremely efficient mosquito  shows up in a population with almost no immunity.

But almost everything else about Zika is surprising  especially the seemingly new links with birth defects and a rare condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome.

I am trying to understand why what we are seeing in Brazil we havent seen in 30 years of circulation in Southeast Asia (and elsewhere), said Dr. Stephen Thomas, an Army colonel and virus expert at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research.

Doctors largely ignored Zika because it usually caused such mild symptoms, if it even caused any symptoms at all.

One study suggests 80 percent of people infected never even noticed, while the other 20 percent mostly suffered rash and a mild fever.

But in Brazil, its not only making people noticeably sick, its suspected of causing a giant increase in serious birth defects and perhaps Guillain-Barre syndrome.

One thing thats holding up research is the lack of a quick and easy test for Zika. Quick tests get Zika mixed up with related viruses that are also common and spreading in the region, including dengue virus and chikungunya.

To try to figure out if anyone else had noticed this, Thomas took the tried-and-true tack of checking the literature  searching through the few scientific papers that have been written about Zika since its discovery in Uganda in 1947.

RELATED: Is Pope Francis contraception allowance during Zika threat a major shift for church?

He found a lot of virus experts have also been baffled by Zikas weird qualities.

For instance, Didier Musso of the Louis Malarde Institute in Tahiti and his colleagues found that Zika was easier to detect in saliva than in blood during an outbreak there in 2013 and 2014. They found Zika in the blood of 28 percent of patients with symptoms, but they could get genetic material from the virus out of 57 percent of saliva samples.

It makes me question whether blood is the proper fluid to be sampling if (you) want to capture Zika, Thomas told a packed seminar on Zika at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health this week.

Brazilian researchers have also reported finding evidence of Zika virus in the urine of patients.

Ann-Claire Gourinat of the Institut Pasteur in Noumea, New Caledonia, reported this last year, as well, after studying the Tahiti outbreak.

Urine samples were positive for Zika virus more than 10 days after onset of disease, which was a notably longer period than for serum samples. This finding supports the conclusion that urine samples are useful for diagnosis of Zika virus infections, they wrote in a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Zika has also been found in amniotic fluid, which mostly is made from the urine produced by the fetus, said Dr. Jeanne Sheffield, director of maternal-fetal medicine at Johns Hopkins.

Theres no evidence that the genetic material from Zika that can be found in saliva and urine can infect people. But a handful of reports suggest the mosquito-borne virus can also be found in and transmitted by semen.

But the findings suggest that testing blood for Zika might not help doctors get on top of the epidemic, Thomas said.

Between the saliva and the semen and the urine, Im not sure what the best samples might be, he said, adding, It also makes me question whether this (is) just a mosquito-to-human transmission.

RELATED: US athletes should consider not attending Olympics if they fear Zika: Officials

Experts took up the issue at a workshop sponsored by the National Academy of Medicine this week.

Theres an urgent need to understand the other modes of transmission and to communicate effectively about them, Dr. Andrew Pavia, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of Utah, said at that meeting.

Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not directly answered questions about the case of a person in Dallas who caught Zika from a sexual partner whod traveled to Venezuela.

They said they presume it was sexually transmitted but reiterated they were investigating further.

One comforting finding is the lack of evidence that mothers can infect their babies through breast milk  although genetic material from Zika can be found in the liquid. The human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS can and does infect babies through breast milk and its very commonly transmitted in semen, but not via saliva or urine.

Another odd effect of Zika  or suspected effect  is what it does to adeveloping fetuss brain.

Its the No. 1 suspect behind a rise in cases of microcephaly, an often devastating birth defect marked by an underdeveloped brain and smaller-than-normal head.

Doctors who have been able to autopsy miscarriages, abortions or babies who died soon after birth are finding unusual and troubling brain damage not usually associated with microcephaly.

Its not just a small head. There are a lot of abnormalities in the brain, Sheffield told the seminar.

These include a smoother-than-normal brain surface  a healthy human brain is very wrinkled  and shrunken brain stems. Theres evidence of damaged eyes, too.

Other viruses are known to damage the brains of developing infants. A herpes virus called cytomegalovirus and rubella, or German measles, are the most notorious.

But Dr. Albert Ko of Yale University, whos been working in Brazil for decades, says the recent microcephaly cases look different.

These are severe presentations, Ko told the seminar. Brain scans show calcifications  hardened tissue that has been damaged and died. There are entire missing areas, sometimes replaced by fluid.

And the other viruses usually affect other areas of the babys body. The Zika-linked damage, however, is confined entirely to the brain.

Thomas says this fits in with decades-old research on animals that suggests Zika prefers to infect nerve tissue.

And that fits in with the final baffling effect of Zika. Is it causing Guillain-Barre syndrome, an inflammation of the nerves that can cause sometime-serious paralysis after any number of infections?

It could be the virus has changed in some way. It could be cross-reacting with its relative, dengue, in people who have been infected with both. Or it could be something else.

Back in 2002, Trump told Howard Stern on his radio show that he was for invading Iraq but that he wishes the first time it was done correctly.

In the last few weeks, the undisputed front-runner also seemed to flip-flop on his opinion of the womens health care organization Planned Parenthood and whether he supported the health insurance mandate that is a part of Obamacare.

On the subject of federal funding for Planned Parenthood Trump said:

Planned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So Im not going to fund it if its doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it.

And on the health insurance mandate he said he doesnt believe in it but that its still important to take care of people who cant afford health care:

Im really talking about people that cant afford it. Were not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans, okay?

Six people of them died, and another two were seriously injured  including a 14-year-old girl who had been pronounced brain dead but squeezed her mothers hand as doctors were preparing to harvest her organs, police said. Amid the carnage, her survival stood out as a miracle, authorities said.

The suspected killer, a 45-year-old Uber driver named Jason Brian Dalton, was in custody Sunday but had not been charged, police said.

Dalton has no record of criminal history, nor anything in his background that would lead us to believe he was capable of this type of behavior, Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley said Sunday morning.

Dalton, who is expected to be charged Monday, apparently acted alone and there was no continuing threat to the community, Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said.

Ubers chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, said Dalton had passed a background check to become a driver. The company was horrified and heartbroken and had offered to help investigators, he said.

Local NBC affiliate WOOD reported that Dalton may have taken fares in between attacks.

The first shooting occurred around 6 p.m. local time at the Meadows Town Homes in the citys northwest, where one woman was shot several times but survived, police said.

The next burst of gunfire happened more than three hours later, when police were called to a car dealership, where Rich Smith and his 17-year-old son, Tyler, were shot dead, authorities said.

The father and child were looking at cars when they were gunned down, according to Robin Buchler, the superintendent of Mattwan High School, where Tyler was a student.

A few minutes later, the gunman approached a Chevrolet Cruze and a Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel. He briefly spoke to the people inside and then unloaded his weapon into both cars, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. All four people in the Cruze, including a 14-year-old girl, were hit, along with the sole occupant of the minivan. All but the girl died.

Michigan State Police identified the dead Cracker Barrel victims as Mary Lou Nye, 63, of Baroda, Michigan; Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, Michigan; Dorothy Brown, 74, of Battle Creek; and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek.

Been a very sad night in our community because of this heinous act of shooting 8 people killing 7. Pray for the victims & their families.  Bobby Hopewell (@Hope4Kzoo) February 21, 2016

The girl was initially reported dead. But more than an hour later, as doctors were preparing to harvest her organs, she squeezed her moms hand, Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz told NBC News. She was then able to respond to questions by squeezing her moms hand several more times, and was rushed into surgery.

Its an absolute miracle, Hinz said.

All eight of Saturdays victims appear to have been chosen at random because they were available, Getting said.

Theres a sense of loss, theres an anger  theres fear  theres all these emotions and then you put on top of that: how do you go and tell the families of these victims that they werent targeted for any reason other than they were there to be a target? Getting said.

Dalton was taken into custody around 12:40 a.m. after his Chevrolet HHR was spotted on a surveillance camera leaving a bar parking lot, authorities said. Police found a semi-automatic handgun during the arrest.

We have 9, 10, 11 shell casings at each of these scenes, Getting said, adding that police were investigating to ensure there no other crime scenes. These werent a sudden explosion ...this was done intentionally.

msnbc,2016-02-21 10:00:00,Judicial nominee backlog mired in partisan politics,"['Luke Russert', 'Mike Brunker']","With the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia, much of the nations attention is locked on who President Barack Obama will nominate to the Supreme Court and the ensuing confirmation battle.

That has some judicial insiders concerned that another important judicial issue  filling vacancies on the federal district and appeals courts  will get short shrift until the political theater surrounding Scalias successor subsides. There are currently 81 federal judicial vacancies and 39 nominees pending, according to the U.S. Federal Courts.

While the Supreme Court gets most public attention, it is worth remembering that it only takes up about 1 percent of the cases that make their way to its august chambers.

Many more are decided in federal, district and appellate courts by judges who are appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. As a result, the languishing nominees awaiting confirmation votes could have a significant impact for years to come.

RELATED: How Obama could win Supreme Court battle  even if Republicans take the White House

Already, the Federal Bar Association, the professional organization for private and government lawyers and judges practicing and sitting in federal courts, has stated that high numbers of vacancies on the federal bench, coupled with increasing caseloads, are creating significant and unprecedented obstacles for the prompt administration of justice in our federal courts.

There currently are nine vacancies on the powerful circuit courts of appeals and 62 on the lower district courts. The remainder are on the U.S. Court of International Trade or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with approving nominees, has recently given bipartisan support for 11 district court nominations and sent them to the Senate floor. But no floor vote has yet been scheduled.

Russell Wheeler, an expert on the federal judiciary and visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said some of the nominees who have cleared the committee have been awaiting confirmation votes since the middle of last year.

Its a very slow pace, he said.

Wheeler said the situation is especially bad in Texas, which has 10 or 11 vacancies that dont even have nominees. ... I think in Texas its difficult to get a civil case heard now because criminal cases get priority.

Democrats say the reason for the building backlog is pure politics driven by the ideological right.

To understand the politics, though, its imperative to understand the procedure.

For decades, it was expected that the president would consult the home state senators of judges put up for nomination, get their approval and then have them shepherd the nomination through the Senate. The unofficial process was meant to help fill vacancies even when political tensions were running high.

It worked like a charm to begin with when Obama nominated Judge Waverly Crenshaw to fill a vacancy for a district court vacancy in Tennessee in February 2015, with the blessing of both Republican senators from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker.

Then, in a bipartisan vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved Crenshaws nomination in July. It has stuck in limbo ever since.

The reason has something to do with building sentiment among conservatives that finally found voice in a statement issued in last month by the influential conservative group Heritage Action, which called on the GOP-led Senate to not allow any more judicial nominees to go forward.

It said the action was justified because Obama began his final year in office by taking aim at the Second Amendment and unilaterally shredding immigration caps set by Congress without congressional approval, referring to recent executive actions announced aimed at expanding background checks for gun sales and protecting as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.

Given the Obama administrations disregard for Congress role in our constitutional system of government, the Senate should refuse to confirm the presidents nominees unless those nominees are directly related to our national security, the group wrote.

Senate Republican leaders have not publicly acknowledged that they are heeding the calls for a blockade on confirmation votes.

Whatever the reason, Democrats say the holdup is extreme.

Refusing to confirm any judicial nominees for the rest of this year would make the high number of vacancies in our federal judiciary even worse, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. This would hurt the American people and weaken our justice system. We cannot allow this to happen.

Leahys staff has noted that when he was the Judiciary chairman during the last two years of George W. Bushs presidency, 68 judicial nominees were confirmed by the Senate.

By contrast, the Judiciary Committee, under its Republican chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, has confirmed only 16 Obama judicial nominees in the last two years.

Republicans on the committee counter that with more than 90 percent of the seats on district and circuit courts filled, the vacancy rate on the federal courts was the lowest of Obamas presidency in 2015 and among the lowest of the last 25 years.

Its unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will be willing to proceed on any further Obama nominees, even if they are supported by the Republican senators from their home state and have been passed out of the Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan vote.

But given the bad blood that will be stirred by Obamas expected nomination of a successor to Scalia, it seems likely that 2016 could be a wash for federal judicial nominations.

msnbc,2016-02-19 11:30:00,A history of Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird',['Msnbc Staff'],"To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee died on Friday at the age of 89 in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama.

Lees famed novel focuses on Scout Finch, a 6-year-old girl growing up during the 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama. It was loosely based on Lees observations as a child being raised during the Depression-era South. The book, among the most beloved and classic American novels, deals with issues of race and morality during a turbulent time in American history. First published on July 11, 1960, its sales have since topped 40 million copies, and it was made into a Oscar-winning movie of the same name in 1962. Lee was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for the novel.

The author released Go Set a Watchman, a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, in July 2015. Lee had completed the novel more than 60 years ago during the 1950s, but set it aside. Her lawyer, Tonja Carter, reportedly found the original manuscript last fall.

After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years, Lee said in a statement at the time.

The literary work was finished before To Kill a Mockingbird, but it was considered essentially a follow-up to that iconic best-seller. The 304-page book was Lees second  the first to be released in more than 50 years. Go Set a Watchman brought a perspective to one of the much-championed main characters, Scouts father Atticus Finch, that many found shocking.

msnbc,2015-01-02 07:58:00,What if Mario Cuomo had run for president?,[],"Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who died on New Years Day at age 82, leaves behind a formidable political legacy  and a mystery for the ages: What if hed gotten on that plane?

It was Dec. 20, 1991, a Friday, and the filing deadline for New Hampshires first-in-the-nation presidential primary was at 5 p.m. All eyes, though, were on Albany, New York where 10 weeks of torturous and highly public vacillation were for Gov. Cuomo finally coming to a head. In the statehouse, he and his team sought a last-minute resolution to a budget impasse that  the governor had suggested more than once  represented the only significant obstacle between him and a presidential candidacy. A few miles away, a private plane sat idling at Albanys airport, ready to whisk Cuomo to the Granite State on a moments notice.

RELATED: Liberal lion Mario Cuomo dies at age 82

It was a drama that had kicked off in early October, when seemingly out of nowhere Cuomo had told a closed-door meeting of his donors at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan that he would think about running for president in 1992. With that one gesture, he effectively froze in place the Democratic field  and all of American politics  for the rest of the fall.

Sure, there were already six Democrats seeking the partys nomination to oppose George H.W. Bush, including Bill Clinton, who we know today as one of American historys most talented political salesmen. But Clinton was a dwarf in 1991, a little-known governor from a backwater state who most people figured was running for president for the exposure. To that point, the story of the presidential race hadnt been who was running; it was who had taken a pass: Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen, Jay Rockefeller  basically, every A-lister on the Democratic side.

Bush was supposed to be invulnerable. In early 91, hed orchestrated the Gulf War, evicting Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and, it was said, helping the country kick its Vietnam syndrome once and for all. Massive parades and homecoming celebrations ensued, pushing Bushs approval rating over 90% and leaving Democrats to pick from scraps. At that point, it was an open question whether the Democratic Party could ever win a national election again. Republicans had won at least 40 states in the past three White House races, and except for Jimmy Carters squeaker in 1976 (which had come to look more and more like a fluke), the GOP was undefeated since 1968. The Democrats, many concluded, were now simply a congressional party.

RELATED: Politicians react to Mario Cuomos death

But the economy was in trouble and Bushs numbers were starting to erode. 92 might not necessarily be a lost cause, Democrats began to say  if only we had a real candidate. Thats what made Cuomos October admission such a major event. The Mario Cuomo of 1991 wasnt just a big-name Democrat  he was the big-name Democrat, a folk hero to the partys beleaguered liberal base ever since his mesmerizing 1984 convention speech, a living, breathing reminder of the politically potent connection with ethnic Catholics that had powered the party in the days of FDR and LBJ  and that had frayed badly in the age of Reagan. To Democrats, the promise of Mario Cuomo was the promise of restoration. It was also the promise of victory. If they were going to break the GOPs Electoral College lock in 92, a Clinton or a Paul Tsongas or a Jerry Brown or a Bob Kerrey wouldnt do it. They needed the stature of a Mario Cuomo.

He didnt make it easy on them. For the rest of October, through all of November, and right up until that fateful Friday before Christmas, Cuomo issued a steady stream of utterly contradictory hints and head fakes. One day, it would sound like he was in. What does my heart tell me? he asked in late October. Go out and tell them, Mario  take your best shot, whether you win, lose or draw. But then nothing would happen. He talked of reaching a decision by the November election, and then by Thanksgiving, but those dates came and went. One of the partys top strategic minds, James Carville, pronounced himself ready to help run a Cuomo campaign  then, after hearing not a peep from Albany, signed on with Clinton. Party leaders grew restless, and his would-be rivals, starved of media oxygen, became contemptuous.

As the New Hampshire deadline neared, Clinton said: I always thought hed run, and I always thought hed wait until the last minute. He waited long enough to see which way the wind was blowing.

Thats when it started to look like Cuomo was actually going to do it. The Monday of that deadline week, his team dispatched an emissary to the New Hampshire Statehouse to retrieve the necessary paperwork. The next day, New Yorks top Republican, Sen. Alfonse DAmato, paid a trip to Albany to ridicule Cuomos inability to reach a budget deal  and to preview what Republicans would say if he went ahead and ran.

The more I hear their attack, Cuomo said, the more enticing it becomes.

By Thursday, there were stories about fundraising calls, out-of-state endorsements and rented office space in New Hampshire. On the day of the deadline, the New York Post quoted a top Cuomo aide saying, It looks and smells like a go. The Washington Post reported that signs pointed to the governor becoming a candidate. There was only one cable news channel back then, and throughout the day that Friday, CNN kept returning to a live shot of the idling plane. Any minute, Cuomo might board it, jet off to New Hampshire, and write his own chapter of history.

But it never moved, and by mid-afternoon it was clear that it wasnt going to. When he faced the press, Cuomo stuck to his script about the budget. If thered been a deal, he said, I would travel to New Hampshire today and file my name as a candidate. But that was  and still is  a hard one to swallow. With all of his pride and conviction, Cuomo never seemed like the kind of guy whod farm out a decision like that to a bunch of opposition party state legislators.

Not that a truly satisfactory explanation has emerged these past 23 years. It remains one of those great conversation-starting what ifs? What if Cuomo had run? Would he have dominated the Democratic field and dethroned a weakened Bush? Or maybe that chronic indecision would have translated into a dysfunctional candidacy that would have wilted under a level of scrutiny Cuomo had never before faced? (My own guess is that Cuomo would have won the nomination, if only because his presence would have dramatically altered how Democrats would have interpreted the subsequent Gennifer Flowers/Bill Clinton scandal  a scandal in which Cuomos name played a role. But thats another column for another day.)

The theory I ultimately gravitate toward is that Mario Cuomo was attracted to the nobility of a lost cause. In 1977, he ran for mayor stoically voicing opposition to capital punishment even as the Son of Sam terrorized New York City. In 1984 at the Democratic convention, his keynote address served as a valentine to the New Deal in liberalisms darkest hour. This is a man who could have looked at all those Democrats running away from George H.W. Bush and his 90% approval rating and decided that maybe this was a race that needed him. And this is a man who, upon realizing that he might actually win, could just as easily have decided he didnt want the trouble.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-10 09:23:00,Supreme Court conservatives block Clean Energy Plan,[],"Much of the political world was focused late yesterday on the New Hampshire presidential primaries, and for good reason: the nations future direction will be shaped in large part by who wins the White House.

But away from the Granite State, Americans received a very different kind of reminder about whats actually at stake in 2016. NBC News Pete Williams reported :

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked enforcement of the Obama administrations ambitious new plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The justices granted a plea from 30 states that asked for a temporary hold on the new Clean Energy Plan while the lower courts decide whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to impose it.

This was ... wait for it ... a 5-4 decision. The courts Republican-appointed conservatives  Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts  agreed to block the energy policy, while the courts Democratic-appointed center-left justices  Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissented.

A New York Times report noted that there is no precedent for the high court taking a step like this: the Supreme Court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court. Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former environmental legal counsel to the Obama administration, described the move as stunning.

To appreciate why, l ets pause for a moment to consider how we reached this point.

As regular readers may recall , in June 2014, President Obama unveiled an ambitious plan to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants, setting reduced emissions limits. Under the plan, the White House offered states some flexibility in how they reach the target: the Obama administration was less concerned with how states cut carbon pollution and more concerned with the end goal. How states got there was up to them.

A total of 27 states balked, saying they not only want to ignore the crisis, but they also believed the Obama administration lacked the authority to impose these requirements. The White House pointed to the Clean Air Act, approved by Congress, to insist the authority most certainly exists.

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  generally considered the nations second highest court  has agreed to hear the case, but it left the policy in place as the legal proceedings continued. Yesterday, five Supreme Court justices intervened  for the first time in American history  to block the implementation of the policy before the appeals court even hears arguments in the case.

Voxs Brad Plumer added , This isnt a fatal blow for Obamas climate rule, but its not a great sign. It suggests that five justices on the Supreme Court have some serious doubts about the Clean Power Plan.

In the meantime, the courts conservative majority offered a powerful and timely reminder to voters about whats on the line in the 2016 election. Readers are going to get tired of seeing me write this , but three current justices will be at least 80 by Inauguration Day 2017. Ginsburg will be 83. A fourth, Breyer, will be 78. The average retirement age: 78.7",[]
msnbc,2016-02-20 22:51:00,Even Donald Trump can't stop Donald Trump,[],"Donald Trump won South Carolina while doing seemingly everything in his power to lose.

That is a scary, scary thought if youre a Republican trying to beat him on March 1, when a slew of southern contests could give him a substantial boost to the nomination. With 99 percent of precincts in, Trump took 32.5 percent of the vote on Saturday, far ahead of second place Senator Marco Rubio and third place Senator Ted Cruz, who each took about 22 percent.

Watching Trump the last week, it was tempting to assume he had made a bet with a friend that he could sabotage his campaign as frequently and needlessly as possible and his supporters would stick with him. Or maybe that even he realizes things have gone too far at this point and he wants out.

RELATED: Trump scores big in South Carolina

The aura of infallibility hes developed after blowing through expectations during the election ensured no one would declare a meltdown, but if there was a method to his madness, it was hard to single out in real time.

Entering South Carolina with a dominant lead, Trump could afford to play things relatively safe like he did in the lead-up to New Hampshire (well, sort of). Instead, he needlessly tweaked GOP dogma and feuded with everyone from the last Republican president to Pope Francis while running after every shiny object in the news that caught his eye. He accused George W. Bush of lying his way into Iraq and blamed him for not preventing 9/11. He dumped on House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday. He seemingly endorsed Obamacares insurance mandate on Thursday and then walked it back on Friday.

Yet somehow it worked.

view photo essay Photos: South Carolina's Republican presidential primary Republican presidential candidates have been campaigning across the Palmetto State in anticipation of its first-in-the-South GOP primary.

Republican voters, who have a nuanced view of President George W. Bush already, proved willing to set aside their old affection when choosing their nominee. He distracted from potentially unsettling news with wild tangents, like calling for an Apple boycott or threatening Senator Ted Cruz with a lawsuit or insinuating President Obama was a Muslim (yet again). He shrugged off old interviews showing that he supported invading Iraq in 2002 and called the invasion a success in 2003, both of which undercut his already entirely unsubstantiated claim that he opposed the war.

His closing message on Friday was an unfocused mess of a speech that included a depraved celebration of war crimes in which he repeated an urban legend about General John Pershing massacring dozens of Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pig blood. So far he has never gone wrong selling fear and bloodlust and Saturday was no exception.

Republicans are now on the precipice of nominating a candidate with virtually no institutional support from the party running on blatant appeals to bigotry, joyful celebrations of torture, and a complete contempt for pieties of movement conservatism.

Even Trump sounded more surprised than thrilled with this development on the eve of voting.

This all began June 16, Trump said at his final rally before the vote, referring to his campaign launch. Who knew this was going to happen? I figured maybe Id be in the pack.

Now the pack is behind him and Trumps supporters are proving his boast that he could shoot a stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue without dropping in the polls.

There are still obstacles ahead. Rubio and Cruz broke away from the rest of the field in South Carolina and have a chance to turn this into a three-man race. But Trumps coalition is real, its voting, and the field has had eight months to find a tool that can crack it without success. They have fewer than two weeks to find one now.",[]

The New York developer chose a very different path. In the 11 days between the two high-profile primaries, Trump appeared in a debate in which he effectively blamed the most recent GOP president for 9/11 and a disastrous war in Iraq. He also picked a fight with Pope Francis. And House Speaker Paul Ryan. And Apple.

More than a few observers argued that the Republican candidate was not only taking an enormous gamble with these antics, but he might also be committing electoral suicide before our very eyes. In the end, however, as MSNBCs Benjy Sarlin explained very well, Even Donald Trump cant stop Donald Trump.

Donald Trump won South Carolina while doing seemingly everything in his power to lose. That is a scary, scary thought if youre a Republican trying to beat him on March 1, when a slew of southern contests could give him a substantial boost to the nomination. With 99 percent of precincts in, Trump took 32.5 percent of the vote on Saturday, far ahead of second place Senator Marco Rubio and third place Senator Ted Cruz, who each took about 22 percent.

In terms of delegate distribution, it now appears Trump will likely end up winning all of South Carolinas 50 delegates. If this stands, its a reminder that the chatter about who finished second is largely irrelevant  in the Palmetto State, first place is about delegates, while second place is about media hype and bragging rights, and nothing else.

Yesterdays double-digit victory, of course, comes on the heels of Trumps 20-point win in New Hampshire  a state with a very different kind of electorate in a very different part of the country, reinforcing the impression that Trumps supporters represent a fairly broad intra-party constituency.

When was the last time a presidential candidate from either party won New Hampshire and South Carolina in the same election cycle and failed to win the nomination? Never. Its simply never happened.

As for the bigger picture, lets again try to cut through the noise and break things down from a pitch-vs-hype-vs-truth perspective.

Donald Trump

The Pitch: South Carolina, a state filled with Southern, evangelical Republicans who have nothing in common with Trump, served as a real opportunity to derail the frontrunner. That didnt happen.

The Buzz: Whether Trump can hold on as the GOP field narrows remains an open question.

The Truth: Theres simply no denying the fact that Trump, whos also favored in Nevada this week, is in the drivers seat. The question for the party is whether it starts accepting him as a nominee or launches one last, all-out, scorched-earth war in the hopes of stopping him.

Marco Rubio

The Pitch: All year, the media has been willing to pretend Rubios losses are actually victories. Maybe everyone will simply play along again?

The Buzz: Hey, everyone, look at how impressive Rubio looked in the midst of his latest defeat!

The Truth: Rubio had every possible advantage in South Carolina  a state his campaign fully intended to win. Practically the entire state Republican establishment pulled every stop to help him, and the media hype bordered on cheerleading. But in the end, he still lost by double digits to a first-time candidate, and just barely avoided another third-place finish. Worse, as part of his failure, Rubio will apparently leave South Carolina with exactly zero delegates.

Ted Cruz

The Pitch: Only two candidates finished in the top three in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Therefore, its a two-person race.

The Buzz : South Carolina was a test of Cruzs Southern evangelicals can carry us to victory plan. He failed the test.

The Truth: In this case, the buzz is the truth. Team Cruz saw South Carolina as the place where he could stall Trumps momentum, and some polling showed the Texas senator narrowing the gap. But in the end, its very hard for Cruz and his allies to spin a third-place, no-delegate finish in a Southern state. Still, he has quite a bit of money, and decent odds in March 1 primaries throughout the South.

Jeb Bush

The Pitch: Well, Bush did say hed finish better than fifth in South Carolina, and technically, he did.

The Buzz: Please clap ... as Jeb exits the stage.

The Truth: Well explore Bushs departure in more detail a little later this morning, but after New Hampshire, I argued he still had a chance to claim the mantle of the competitive establishment candidate. He failed to do so in South Carolina. No more chances.

John Kasich

The Pitch: As the sole survivor in the governors lane, Kasich sees this as a four-person race.

The Buzz: If the Ohio governor has a path to the nomination, no one outside Kasich campaign HQ can see it.

The Truth: Kasich may be a fine general election candidate, and Democrats almost certainly would prefer not to run against him, but his odds after a second-place showing in New Hampshire arent budging. Look for him to work hard in March 1 states like Vermont and Massachusetts, where he has a decent shot of strong showings. Possible twist: can he get Jebs support?

Ben Carson

The Pitch: Carson, who has nothing else to do, is in no hurry to withdraw.

The Buzz: Carson will very likely finish in last place in most, if not all, of the remaining primaries and caucuses.",[]

Cruz has consistently finished in the top three since the Iowa caucuses, where he finished in first place with 22 percent of the vote. In the New Hampshire primary, he came in third place behind Donald Trump and John Kasich.

msnbc,2016-02-19 13:45:00,Is Philadelphia testing its drinking water correctly?,['Lisa Riordan Seville'],"Philadelphias water passed its last round of lead testing with flying colors, but documents obtained by NBC News show those results may offer a misleading picture of the lead flowing from Philly taps.

A memo obtained by NBC News through a records request shows that in 2014 in a city with up to 50,000 homes with lead pipes, Philadelphia based its clean bill of health on sampling just 34 homes with lead pipes  fewer than required by law  while instead testing far more homes without lead pipes. After inquiries from NBC News, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said it is now reviewing Philadelphias data.

Experts say the choice of houses, coupled with other flaws in the citys testing methods, may be offering Phillys residents false comfort about the quality of their water - and are a symptom of nationwide testing failures that may have masked lead problems in cities across the country, including Flint. Compared to some other U.S. utilities, Philadelphia Water has a reputation for being well-run and resourced.

I have the utmost respect for the folks in Philadelphia, and if this is whats going on in Philadelphia I shudder to think whats going on in the rest of the country, said Dr. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech researcher who was key to exposing the Flint lead crisis.

State and local officials are struggling to follow a federal regulation known as the Lead and Copper Rule thats designed to gauge whether a utility is properly treating its water to prevent corrosion of pipes that would leach heavy metals like lead into the water.

If 90 percent of homes tested register below the action level of 15 parts per billion of lead, the system is considered compliant. But testers are supposed to focus on high-risk homes, meaning older structures that have lead pipes or lead service lines in order to get a worst-case picture of the system.

Despite assurances by Flint and Sebring, Ohio, utilities that they were testing high-risk homes, neither was. Now officials in both towns are scrambling to address lead issues overlooked for months or years.

In a city like Philadelphia, which has old housing stock and thousands of lead pipes, the rule requires at least half the homes tested be high risk.

But documents obtained by NBC News show that Philadelphia Water was missing many high-risk homes, and getting test results from neighborhoods with relatively new, and therefore lower risk, homes. The percentage of high-risk homes tested had also dropped over time. The results show that the homes picked may determine whether the city seems to have safe water or seems to have a problem.

In 2002, 54 of the homes tested in Philadelphia were highest-risk Tier 1 homes, meaning they had lead pipes or copper pipes with lead solder laid just before the lead solder ban in 1986. In 2002, the city only tested a total of 63 homes, and only nine were low-risk.

Philadelphias all-important 90th percentile  the result that triggers its overall grade  came in at 13 parts per billion, just two points under the action level that requires utilities warn customers of the risk. Five lead-line houses that year tested high, as did one low-risk copper-line home.

By the following round of testing, three years later, most of the high-lead homes had dropped out of the testing pool. Since then, as the number of high-risk homes in the test group dwindled while the overall pool of tested homes grew, the citys results improved.

In 2014, Philadelphia tested just 34 homes with lead lines, and eight with high-risk lead solder. Those 42 high-risk homes made up less than a third of the 134 homes tested. That year, the citys 90th percentile had 5 ppb of lead in its water, well under the 15 ppb action level. Eight results tested high that year  three lead-line homes, and five lower-risk copper pipe homes.

The trend of choosing low-risk homes is combined with sampling instructions for test homes, first revealed in documents obtained by the Guardian, that may also skew the results downward.

Residents are told to remove their tap aerator and run their water the night before the test to flush out the line, known as pre-flushing, a practice that EPA water experts say can produce misleading results and has been used in other cities, like Flint.

RELATED: Parents of tragic 2-year-old with lead poisoning sue Flint

This clears particulate lead out of the plumbing and biases the results low, wrote EPA scientist Miguel Del Toral in a February 2015 email about Flints testing obtained by researchers at Virginia Tech. This practice provides false reassurance about the true lead levels in the water, he added.

Asked if Philadelphias method of choosing homes and pre-flushing could skew results, EPA water expert Mike Schock said, In my technical opinion, yes it would.

Philadelphia counters that its testing methods paint an accurate picture of a city where high lead is an anomaly, not the rule.

Its not clear that the way were taking samples is hiding problems, said Gary Burlingame, director of Philadelphia Waters Bureau of Laboratory Services. Could we be missing homes out there that have higher lead levels than others? Of course.

Utilities across the U.S. have told regulators about the challenges of meeting the federal rules demands. Cities must solicit volunteers for their water studies, and then ask the volunteers to run the tests themselves. In its memo to regulators, Philadelphia Water said it sent over 8,000 letters to customers, and only 134 had followed through the process.

People arent responding, said Burlingame, and often dont continue testing from one year to the next. Lead in water just hasnt been something thats been a national issue.

The state Department of Environmental Protection accepted Philadelphias results, and the citys argument that it was not able to get more high-risk homes. This despite the state agencys own guidance that, in accord with the federal rule that at least half of the homes tested in cities like Philly, with old homes and lots of lead pipes, should be high-risk.

RELATED: Hillary Clinton: There are too many Flints

The state also has guidance that any homes tested beyond the required number be high risk so as not to dilute the testing pool. Philadelphia was only required to test 50 homes in total, but tested 134  most of them low-risk. Burlingame said the utility tested the extra homes because it believed a larger pool would give a more accurate picture of the system.

He added that flushing the line was to clear any hot water from the tap. The federal rule is designed to test cold water, he said.

The DEP said that while half of homes tested should be high risk, sometimes a utility is not able to find enough high-risk homes. However, the agency said it is now reviewing the data submitted by Philadelphia.

The agency also said that Philadelphia had not diluted its pool in 2014, despite the extra homes in the sample, because more low-risk homes had tested high than high-risk homes.

The tier 3 [low risk] sample actually skewed the overall sample level higher, while still registering below action levels, the DEP said in a statement. Burlingame also said the city has seen problems in lower-risk homes in the past.

In addition, both the DEP and the EPA have issued explicit guidance telling utilities not to remove aerators when testing. But the DEP said it cant make utilities comply.

Both state and federal guidelines do recommend that aerators not be removed, said a DEP spokesperson. However, states cannot enforce recommendations or guidance.

Flaws in testing have not stopped officials across the country from trying to calm the fears of residents in the wake of Flint. Earlier this month, based on testing results from Philadelphia and more than 150 other state water utilities that came in under the action level, the state DEP told Pennsylvanians that drinking water is not the source of elevated lead levels found in some of the states children.

DEP Secretary John Quigley sent a clear message to the people of the state: DEP has regulations and programs in place to monitor lead levels in drinking water, and they are working.

Rachel Maddow talks with Chuck Todd about how Nevadas Democratic delegate will be apportioned given the confusing outcomes in 2008 and in other states like New Hampshire. embed like save share group

As of yesterday morning, no one could say with any confidence who was even favored. But when the dust settled, there was nevertheless a clear winner .

Hillary Clinton won Nevadas Democratic caucuses on Saturday, NBC News projected, scoring a much-needed boost in the nomination race and depriving rival Bernie Sanders of a victory in a racially diverse state. The loss is a blow for Sanders, who hoped to use the states contest to prove himself as a viable candidate in a state with an electorate made up of more minority voters and fewer self-described liberals than the races earlier contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

With just about all of the precincts reporting, it looks like Clintons margin of victory was about six points , 53% to 47%. In terms of delegate distribution, it was also fairly close, with Clinton picking up 19 delegates to Sanders 15.

But what makes yesterdays developments so important has less to do with these precise totals and more to do with the impact on the Democratic race overall.

There are two broad angles to keep in mind. The first is the fact that if Clinton had come up short in Nevada, as many observers predicted, the coverage was going to be brutal. The Washington Post ran a piece last week with an ungenerous headline  Hillary Clinton could blow it in Nevada  which seemed emblematic of the general media buzz.

Nevada, the conventional wisdom said, was supposed to be a Clinton firewall state, which would help the former Secretary of State bounce back after Sanders landslide victory in New Hampshire last week. A Sanders victory would have created chatter about a crumbling firewall and a renewed sense of panic among Clintons supporters in the party.

Her six-point victory does the opposite.

The second angle is that Nevada was a real opportunity for Sanders to change the trajectory of the race. When the Vermont independent nearly tied Clinton in Iowa, and cruised to an easy win in New Hampshire, skeptics noted that the first two states were practically custom made for the senator: Sanders is strongest in states where the universe of Democratic voters is very white and very liberal. Based on previous performance, that means the three best states in the Union for the senator are, in order, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Iowa.

Nevada, therefore, offered Sanders a chance to prove that he can win in a more diverse state  an argument that would give his candidacy renewed credibility as the race goes forward.

Clintons win yesterday means that opportunity has come and gone. Conditions may yet change, but shes favored to do well in South Carolinas primary next week, and theres some polling that suggests shes well positioned to win most of the March 1 primaries soon after.",[]

msnbc,2016-02-21 12:09:00,Cyclone Winston: Six dead after record-breaking storm hits Fiji,['Associated Press'],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand  Most of Fiji was without electricity Sunday and residents were told to stay inside for a second straight night as officials scrambled to restore services and assess damage in the wake of a ferocious cyclone that left at least six people dead and destroyed homes.

Winds from Cyclone Winston, which tore through the Pacific Island chain over the weekend, reached 180 miles per hour, making it the strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere since record-keeping began, according to Weather.com.

Although the weather calmed Sunday, a curfew was extended through early Monday and police were empowered to make arrests without a warrant to ensure order.

In a televised address to the nation Sunday, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said many people had been left without power, fresh water or communications.

The damage has been widespread, homes have been destroyed, many low-lying areas have flooded, and many people have been left stunned and confused about what to do, he said.

He said that the police and military had been brought in to help with rescue operations and the general cleanup, and that government agencies were working overtime to clear roads and restore power.

This is a time of sorrow, but it will also be a time of action, Bainimarama said. We will stand united in the face of this disaster.

Officials were trying to establish communications and road access to the hardest-hit areas, and said they would not know the full extent of the damage and injuries until then.

George Dregaso of Fijis National Disaster Management Office said that two people on Ovalau Island died when the house they were sheltering in collapsed on them, and that another man was killed on Koro Island, although it wasnt clear how.

Authorities also said three people on the main island of Viti Levu were killed in the storm, but didnt have more details.

Tourism Minister Faiyaz Siddiq Koya said that all tourists in Fiji were safe and that there was no significant damage to the majority of hotels on the main island. Fiji is a popular tourist destination, known for its beach resorts and scuba diving.

Cyclone Winston hit Fiji on Saturday and moved westward overnight along the northern coast of Viti Levu. Fijis capital, Suva, located in the southern part of the main island, was not directly in the cyclones path and avoided the worst of its destructive power.

Truth be told, weve gotten off pretty lightly here in the capital, said Alice Clements, a spokeswoman for UNICEF. It was still a pretty awful night. You could hear crashing trees and power lines, and popping rivets as roofs got lifted and ripped out.

She said there was foliage everywhere that looked like it had been put through a blender.

About 80 percent of the nations 900,000 people were without regular power, although about one-third of them were able to get some electricity from generators, said Dregaso, the disaster office official. Landlines throughout Fiji were down, but most mobile networks were working.

Dregaso said there were 483 people who had evacuated from their homes and were staying in 32 emergency shelters. He said he expected the number of evacuees to rise.

Authorities were urging people to remain indoors as they cleared fallen trees and power lines. They said that all schools would be closed for a week to allow time for the cleanup, and that three universities would be closed until further notice.

The government declared a 30-day state of natural disaster, giving extra powers to police to arrest people without a warrant.

The government said the curfew would end at 5:30 a.m. Monday.

The curfew has been imposed to protect lives and protect property, Prime Minister Bainimarama said in his address.

Clements, the UNICEF spokeswoman, said there was particular concern for people on the northern part of the main island and on smaller islands. She said that many would have lost their homes and livelihoods, and that some tourist resorts on the outer islands may have been damaged.

The airport reopened Sunday to allow emergency flights, Dregaso said, after many flights had been canceled the day before.

msnbc,2016-02-21 14:15:00,RNC chair on brokered convention: 'We're prepared for anything',[],"Donald Trumps first-place finish in South Carolina has revived an ongoing discussion about the possibility of a brokered Republican convention, the prospect of which became a central question as the candidates made the rounds of the post-primary Sunday shows.

The business mogul toppled his rivals in the Palmetto State with 33 percent of the vote. Sen. Marco Rubio, his nearest competitor, came in 10 percentage points behind him and barely overtook Sen. Ted Cruz for second place. Trumps victories in South Carolina and New Hampshire, as well as his second-place finish in Iowa, give him a decisive lead in the delegate count and establish him as the clear front-runner going into the February 23 Nevada caucus  a scenario that has sent some Republicans into a panic.

When asked by Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union if party leaders do not take Trump seriously despite his strong showings, Trump pointed to his status as an outsider.

All of the establishment sort of said, Well, wait a minute. What happened to him? Hes not supposed to be doing that. Thats not in the cards, Trump said of his presidential bid. I dont want money. You know, Im self-funding my campaign, so I dont need donor money and lobbyist money and special interest money. And that bothers them because the special interests want to control their candidates, and I cant be controlled.

RELATED: Jeb Bush leaves behind a party he can barely recognize

Some on the right have argued that if the GOP field does not consolidate behind one or two alternative candidates in the coming weeks, the chances of Trump winning the nomination or the GOP having a brokered convention would increase dramatically. However, Trump dismissed the notion of a brokered convention, which would occur if no candidate has the required amount of delegates to secure the nomination. The Republicans would then take the battle to the convention floor to decide on a nominee in July.

I dont think were going to have a convention, a brokered convention. I think its unlikely. I think Im doing better than that. And so far, you know, Im really on my way, Trump told Tapper. I thought I actually won Iowa if you look at it really closely. But even if I didnt, I just got one delegate less because I came in a very, very close second. So I have a second and I have two firsts. And New Hampshire was a blowout, and this one was a blowout.

Despite telling reporters earlier this month that his campaign was planning for a race that could go to the convention floor, Marco Rubio on Sunday also dismissed talk of a brokered convention while decrying party insiders.

I dont think its likely. I think the voters are going to decide it. I most certainly dont want party insiders deciding this, because if party insiders had been the ones deciding this nomination, I wouldnt be standing. I wouldnt be here right now doing this interview with you, Rubio said in an interview with Tapper. I wouldnt have even been in the Senate, for that matter. They didnt want me in the Senate.

On ABCs This Week, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus denied that Trumps rise was an indictment of the party leadership. Priebus also insisted that the RNC would support whomever the eventual nominee is, even as Trump continues to claim that the committee is treating him unfairly.

I think its early in the process, but certainly when the time comes and when were sitting either before Cleveland or at Cleveland or whenever that point may come, and we have a presumptive nominee, what will happen is the RNC will join in with that nominee, and we will put together the biggest, which weve already started doing, the biggest ground game and data operation that weve ever seen, Priebus said.

When asked if the RNC was planning for a brokered convention, Priebus said he doubted that one would occur but that the party leadership would be ready if necessary.

Planning can mean a lot of things. Were prepared for anything. I was general counsel for two years before I was chairman of this party, Ive been chairman for six years. I dont think there are too many people that are more familiar with the procedures of nominating someone at a convention than I am, Priebus told George Stephanopoulos. So Im prepared, and we will be prepared if that happens, but again, I dont think thats going to be the case. If it did, then of course, obviously, it would be pretty historic. But well be ready.",[]
msnbc,2016-02-19 09:12:00,US fighter jets target ISIS in Libya's Sabratha; dozens killed,"['Alastair Jamieson', 'Jim Miklaszewski']","U.S. fighter jets launched airstrikes against an ISIS compound in Libya overnight as they targeted a terrorist linked to tourist massacres in Tunisian, American military officials said.

Dozens of people were killed in the bombing raid on the coastal city of Sabratha, local officials and activists said. Warplanes struck a house 6 miles outside the city center, Sabrathas municipal administration said.

A senior U.S. official told NBC News the airstrike likely killed Tunisian ISIS operative Noureddine Chouchane.

The 36-year-old jihadist was directly linked to the two 2015 attacks in Tunisia - on a resort hotel in Sousse and the Bardo Museum in Tunis, officials said.

RELATED: MSF-supported clinic in Syria destroyed by airstrike, Doctors Without Borders says

Sabratha is close to the Tunisian border and one of the areas where Western officials say ISIS militants had some presence as part of their expansion in the North African state.

Citing hospital figures, the city council said 41 people were killed and 6 wounded in the airstrike, which took place at 3:30 a.m. Friday (8:30 p.m. Thursday ET).

It said the bombed building was being used by Tunisians, including ISIS militants and that machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were found under the rubble.

The raid came after President Barack Obama warned that Washington was prepared to strike inside Libya. We will continue to take actions where there is a clear target in mind, he said Tuesday.

The strike was carried out by 2 US F-15s from Lakenheath in England. Defense officials told NBC News the strike would not be the last in Libya, but stressed it did not mark the beginning of a larger, sustained campaign against ISIS there.

There was no information that an attack was imminent but the fighters at the compound were getting ready to do something, one defense official said.

The dead were mostly Tunisians according to the Sabratha Media Center, which describes itself as an NGO founded by a group of local journalists.

To those asking if they were ISIS or not, we ask for them to wait and be patient, because foreigners lived in the [targeted] house, mostly Tunisians. Tomorrow we will know in details, it said a post on social media.

Since strongman Mohammad Gaddafi was overthrown five years ago by rebel forces backed by a campaign of NATO air strikes, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos with two rival governments each backed by competing factions of former rebel brigades.

Sabratha, which had a population of about 100,000 at the time of Libyas 2004 census, lies on the Mediterranean coast about 40 miles west of Tripoli. It is home to a UNESCO-protected archaeological site of Roman ruins.

Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier this month that Libya was emerging as a particular concern in the fight against ISIS. He said the failing state was a breeding ground for jihadists who could take over abandoned oil fields.

The last thing in the world you want is a false caliphate with access to billions of dollars of oil revenue, Kerry said.

Tunisia, which shares nearly 400 miles of border with Libya, has been worried for weeks about what they understood to be an imminent strike by the U.S.-led coalition targeting ISIS.

It recently built nearly a wall of sand and trenches to fortify its border amid concern about militants, arms traffickers and refugees entering its territory.

Patrick Porter, professor of strategic studies at the University of Exeter, told a committee of British lawmakers earlier this month that ISIS was seeking opportunities in Libya, exploiting that countrys chaos as it came under pressure from U.S.-led and Russian airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.

ISIS is looking for somewhere to re-establish itself, he said. It is a sign of a movement that is looking opportunistically for other chances, because it is finding it much more difficult than even a year ago.

msnbc,2016-02-13 11:23:00,"Polar vortex triggers subzero temperatures, 'life-threatening' wind chill",['Alastair Jamieson'],"A polar vortex of brutally cold air sent temperatures plummeting to life-threatening lows across the Midwest and Northeast Saturday, with millions of Americans warned of dangers including frostbite.

The coldest air mass of the winter brought the thermometer down to minus-6 degrees overnight in Minneapolis, while New Yorkers were urged to take extreme precautions against wind chill.

Forecasters warned it would be Tuesday before temperatures return to normal, with Sunday morning likely to be the coldest for many.

The arctic blast is a result of a piece of the polar vortex  the cold air system that sits over the North Pole year-round  coming further south and combining with a cold front.

An eddy of the polar vortex over Quebec, along with a reinforcing cold front, is expected to bring the coldest weather of this winter season from the Great Lakes to New England, the National Weather Service said in an update early Saturday.

Wind chill warnings and lake effect snow warnings are in effect for these areas, with wind chill readings dropping below minus-30 degrees by Saturday night. Actual temperatures will also be frigid with highs in the single digits and teens, and subzero lows across much of upstate New York and New England.

In New York, it was so cold that organizers canceled an Ice Festival scheduled for Saturday in Central Park.

Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to check on vulnerable friends, relatives and neighbors. Extremely cold weather can be life threatening  especially for seniors, infants and people with medical conditions, he said.

And in Washington, D.C., weather was expected to impact Saturdays Cupids Undie Run, a charity race in which participants strip down to their skivvies.

Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, could see record lows over the weekend.

However, apart from lake effect snow over the Great Lakes area, there wont be a repeat of the heavy snow that struck the Northeast earlier this month.

The biggest danger is from frostbite, said John Rowe, lead forecaster at The Weather Channel.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, accuses Chad and Nicole Neal of violating the Civil Rights Act and Oklahomas anti-discrimination laws for refusing to allow Rajaee Fatihah to use their gun range last October because of his religion. At the time, the Neals business, Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range in Muskogee County, reportedly had a sign outside saying it was a Muslim-free business, according to the lawsuit.

For an establishment to ban someone based on their religion isnt just reprehensible  its against the law, Veronica Laizure, civil rights director for the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement. We hope that these owners and others around the country will comply with civil rights law and stop refusing service to customers in this manner.

RELATED: Jeb Bush tweeted a photo of a gun, because America

The Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), of which Tulsa-native Fatihah is a board member, filed the lawsuit along with the American Civil Liberties Union in Oklahoma and the national ACLU.

Last year, CAIR brought a similar complaint against Florida gun store owner Andy Hallinan, but a federal judge dismissed it in November, saying the organization did not prove its members were harmed by the stores policy.

Robert J. Muise, senior counsel of the American Freedom Law Center, which represented Hallinan and now the Neals, told NBC News in a statement Thursday that the center hasnt had a chance to review the lawsuit in detail because the Neals had not yet been served, but added that such litigation weakens local and national security.

Not only do our clients have a right to refuse to serve someone they believe to be a public safety risk, they have an obligation to their other customers, employees, and the community to do so, Muise said.

Muise told the Guardian Wednesday that the Muslim-free sign outside the Neals business is protected free speech, and that Fatihah was asked to leave not because of his religion but because he was belligerent, an accusation Fatihah denied.

The only thing the law prohibits is if somebody denies services strictly on the basis of religion, and that didnt happen here, Muise told The Guardian.

According to Fatihahs lawsuit, Nicole Neal asked Fatihah to fill out a liability waiver when he asked to use the range on Oct. 23. After signing it, Fatihah told Nicole Neal he was a Muslim, prompting her to summon her husband, the lawsuit alleges. The Neals then allegedly armed themselves with handguns and asked Fatihah, who enjoys recreational shooting and wanted to practice, if he had come to the gun range to commit an act of violence or as part of a jihad, according to the lawsuit. Fatihah was then asked to leave, he alleges.

Fatihah, who works as an investigator for the state of Oklahoma, is asking the court to order the Neals to comply with the Civil Rights Act and Oklahoma common law and is seeking monetary damages for mental and emotional distress.

The Chicago Tribune released the black-and-white photo of Sanders, which was confirmed as authentic by the Vermont independents presidential campaign.

Bernie identified it himself, Tad Devine, senior adviser to the campaign, told the Tribune. He looked at it  he actually has his student ID from the University of Chicago in his wallet  and he said, Yes, that indeed is [me].

As a student at the University of Chicago, Sanders was active in the civil rights movement. He was the leader of the Congress of Racial Equality and led protests and sit-ins against the institutions student housing policies.

The newly discovered photo shows Sanders being taken away by two Chicago police officers. According to the Tribune, the protest on August 12, 1963, was in response to plans by the Chicago public school system to open segregated mobile classrooms for black students. Sanders was charged with resisting arrest and found guilty. He was given a $25 fine, the publication said, citing archival reports about the protests.

His campaign also confirmed to The New York Times on Friday that a video released this week showing a young man being arrested is of Sanders. According to the Times, Kartemquin Films uploaded the video. Devine told the Times that Sanders recalls owning a watch similar to the one the man in the video was wearing. The video was shot by Jerry Temaner, one of the co-founders of the film company.

Is this Bernie Sanders being arrested? from Kartemquin Films on Vimeo.

The presidential hopeful and his rival in the race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are in an intense battle to win over black voters. Clinton and her supporters have called Sanders a single-issue candidate, saying that he focuses too much on economic issues and doesnt have an effective racial injustice plan. Theyve also questioned his history of civil rights advocacy, with Rep. John Lewis, an icon of the movement, saying he never met Sanders but didnt mean to disparage his activism.",[]

And on the trail, theres evidence the attacks have taken their toll  Rubio is asked about the immigration issue every few town halls, from voters wanting him to clarify his involvement in the 2013 Gang of 8 reform bill and in particular its inclusion of a path to citizenship.

Ted Cruz said he wanted to find a compromise. Ted Cruz said he wanted to bring 11 million people out of the shadows. Ted Cruz said that he wanted immigration reform to pass, he said.

Cruz has said that many of his amendments to the bill at the time were actually intended as poison pills meant to take the reform bill down. But their differences on immigration reform are sure to take center stage in whats become an increasingly nasty fight in recent days as the two battle to be the alternative to Trump.

msnbc,2016-02-18 17:42:00,Is Pope Francis' contraception allowance during Zika threat a major shift for church?,['Erik Ortiz'],"Pope Francis on Thursday suggested using artificial contraception in countries afflicted with the Zika virus would be OK for women worried with how the disease is linked to rare birth defects.

Calling it a lesser of two evils, Francis indicated that choosing to avoid pregnancy altogether would be the better alternative to abortion.

Abortion is an evil in and of itself, but it is not a religious evil at its root, no? Its a human evil, he told reporters en route to Rome following his six-day visit to Catholic-heavy Latin America, which is grappling with a Zika outbreak.

On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil, he continued. In certain cases, as in this one (Zika), such as the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear.

Francis held up Pope Paul VI as an example of a sort of precedence on the issue: In the 1960s, Paul VI approved nuns in the Belgian Congo to use artificial contraception to prevent pregnancies amid the threat of rape.

But the pontiff on Thursday also urged doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines to fight the mosquitoes that harbor and spread Zika.

This needs to be worked on, Francis said.

The use of contraception is strictly prohibited under Roman Catholic Church teachings.

A passage in the Book of Genesis is often cited by scholars. In it, a son of Judah named Onan is described as wasting his seed on the ground when having sexual relations with his brothers widow, so that he doesnt impregnate her.

This form of contraception, however, upsets the Lord, who then smote Onan, the Bible says.

RELATED: Pope suggests Trump not Christian, but others back Mexico wall

Francis didnt elaborate on any specific type of contraception, but his decision to not declare an outright ban is an about-face from what Brazilian church leaders have said. Brazil is battling a rise in Zika cases.

Contraceptives are not a solution. There is not a single change in the churchs position, said Brazilian Bishop Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, according to reports.

But Francis, while not completely opening the door to contraception in other similar scenarios, appears to be building on his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

In 2009, he drew controversy for saying that condom use can aggravate the spread of AIDS in Africa.

You cant resolve it with the distribution of condoms, the conservative pope told reporters aboard his papal jet after leaving AIDS-ravaged Africa. On the contrary, it increases the problem.

But the following year, in what some reports called a seismic shift, Benedict softened his stance on prophylactics and supported the use of condoms to fight AIDS  even if it results in preventing a pregnancy.

In certain cases, where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection, it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another, more humane sexuality, Benedict said, while also extolling abstinence as the preferred method.

Francis last year declined to delve deeply into the topic of condoms.

When asked about the issue while leaving Africa after a six-day visit, he suggested the form of birth control was a mere Band-Aid solution. The continent, he said, had other pressing problems, including poverty and exploitation.

msnbc,2016-02-21 11:55:00,Sanders: Voter turnout 'not as high as I had wanted',['Danny Freeman'],"On the morning after Bernie Sanders loss to Hillary Clinton in the Nevada caucuses, the Vermont senator admitted he was perhaps finally proven right.

Voter turnout was not as high as I had wanted, Sanders allowed on NBCs Meet the Press, and what Ive said over and over again, is we will do well when young people when working class people come out, we do not do well when voter turnout is not large.

Sanders has trumpeted this sentiment for months, even telling NBC News on caucus day that The bigger the turnout, the better I feel.

Yet turnout for Saturdays first-in-the-west caucus contest was estimated at about 80,000 people, a significant drop from the 120,000 people who came out to caucus in 2008.

We did not do as good a job as I had wanted to bring out a large turnout, said the Senator.

With nearly all precincts reporting Sunday, Clinton sat comfortably at 53 percent while Sanders trailed at 47 percent.

Sanders did highlight bright spots in the results though, pointing to entrance polls showing him leading Clinton with Latino voters (something the Clinton campaign has already argued is misleading) and his unquestioned strength with young voters.

Remember we were taking on a candidate who ran in 2008, hedged the Senator, She knew Nevada a lot better than we did, she had the names of a lot of her supporters, so Im proud of the campaign that we ran.

At the end of the day, I think she gets 19 delegates, we get 15 delegates, we move on to the next states, he added.

And Sanders assured viewers Sunday, he is not to be counted out yet in the nomination contest.

We are in this race to the convention, Sanders emphasized, pointing to states such as Colorado, Minnesota, and Massachusetts where he believes his campaign has a good shot at winning.

I think weve got some states coming down the pipe we are going to do very well in, Sanders continued.

The candidate was then presented with a clip of Hillary Clintons caucus night victory speech, during which the former secretary of state went after Wall Street saying, No bank can be too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail!

Were looking into the copyright issues here! Sanders joked, Those are our words!
