fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 16:08:24+00:00,Why Its So Hard To Prove Zika Is Causing Birth Defects,['Christie Aschwanden'],"For weeks, Zika virus has been all over the news. Stark photos of babies with microcephaly, a birth defect in which the infants head is abnormally small and its brain often not fully developed, have accompanied stories about the ongoing spread of Zika across more than 20 countries. Several Latin American countries have advised women (many of whom lack access to reliable birth control) to avoid pregnancy for the time being, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that pregnant women avoid traveling to countries with the Zika virus if they can. These scary bulletins can overshadow an important fact: The Zika virus has not yet been proven to cause microcephaly.

The proposed link between Zika and microcephaly began taking shape in September after some pediatricians in northeast Brazil noticed an unusual number of babies born with microcephaly. This spike in microcephaly cases coincided with an outbreak of Zika, a virus related to the dengue virus and spread by mosquitoes, and when a task force set up a registry to track the problem, it discovered that in 26 of the first 35 cases entered, the mother had developed an illness with a rash potentially indicative of Zika during her pregnancy.

Given the apparent overlap between microcephaly and Zika virus, The first impression is that theres a relationship one to the other, said Denise Cavalcanti, a geneticist at the State University of Campinas in Campinas, Brazil. First impressions can sometimes deceive, though, and she said the evidence linking the two is circumstantial and not yet confirmed. We should prove this scientifically.

But confirming a link between Zika and microcephaly will take more research and time  months, if not years  and the confirmation may end up as a preponderance of evidence rather than a definitive link. Whats easy to forget about the oft-cited scientific mantra, correlation is not causation, is that causation is incredibly difficult to prove. When youre a doctor whos seeing an alarming number of infants born with birth defects, correlation may be all you have to go on. If youre a public health official with the job of protecting your community from a scary new threat, you cant always wait for certainty before you act. And that means you must give advice based on the imperfect evidence you have, rather than the definitive data you wish you had.

The evidence available at the moment led experts at the World Health Organization to conclude that a causal relationship between Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, though not yet scientifically proven. Which is why, as my colleague Anna Maria Barry-Jester explained on FiveThirtyEight recently, the WHOs declaration of a public health emergency of international concern referred to the cluster of birth defects and a potentially paralyzing condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome, not the Zika virus itself. Sometimes lost amid the worry is the fact that Zika produces relatively minor symptoms, and only in about 20 percent of people infected. And at the moment, theres no quick and easy test for Zika that can be used outside a research setting.

The evidence connecting Zika and microcephaly remains circumstantial, but its growing. Theres not going to be any single perfect piece of data to link Zika to microcephaly, said Melinda Moore, a pediatrician at the RAND Corp. who previously studied infectious diseases at the CDC. Instead, researchers must piece together multiple lines of imperfect evidence to come up with a clear picture.

But efforts to construct that clear picture face some major challenges. As Brazilian pediatrician Sandra da Silva Mattos and her colleagues recently wrote in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, The first question to be addressed is the real incidence of microcephaly in Northeast Brazil. Before scientists can confirm that Zika is causing microcephaly, they need to know how common microcephaly was before Zika and how widespread it is now. Right now, the answer to both of those questions remains muddy.

In search of numbers, da Silva Mattoss group put together a local task force to go back and look for microcephaly in a database of newborns in northeast Brazil born mostly before the current outbreak. They found that the incidence of microcephaly in the area was much higher than expected  from 2 percent to 8 percent, depending on which criteria were used for diagnosis (more on that in a minute). However, when they reviewed only extreme cases, the incidence fell in the range of 0.02 percent to 0.19 percent, which is in line with the incidences reported for microcephaly in other parts of the world. They also found that microcephaly cases varied seasonally, in a pattern that could reflect the peak activity of mosquitoes that carry Zika.

But heres the puzzle: This fluctuation was seen as far back as late 2012, several years before Zika is known to have appeared in Brazil in mid-2014. In fact, cases of microcephaly seem to have peaked early in 2014, before Zikas appearance in Brazil, most likely during a sporting event, later that year. This finding could suggest another cause, or it could mean that Zika entered this area earlier than was previously known. Its important to note that da Silva Mattoss review is a preliminary report.

What first looked like a startling epidemic of microcephaly cases could turn out to be, at least in part, an example of the awareness effect  an uptick in cases that happens when increased awareness of a problem leads to the identification (or, in some cases, misidentification) of cases that otherwise would have gone undetected. Microcephaly was probably underreported before Zika, and Jorge Lopez-Camelo and Ieda Maria Orioli from the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations note in a report they had translated into English for Nature that Brazils Live Birth Information System recorded only about a third as many birth defect cases as would be expected based on incidence in other parts of the world. Unless the area had an unusually low baseline rate of birth defects, any new effort to look for a specific defect could easily result in a two-thirds increase in numbers, simply by finding cases that would otherwise have gone uncounted.

Some of the confusion may come down to how microcephaly is classified and counted. A commentary published in the Lancet this month describes how different standards for diagnosing microcephaly can drastically alter how many cases are found. Under criteria in use by Brazils Ministry of Health up to Dec. 8, northeast Brazil (where the problem is thought to be most severe) would have had an estimated 158,000 suspected cases. But the standard adopted by the ministry on Dec. 8 reduced that estimate to 46,000  less than a third of what it was previously  simply by setting the cutoff for microcephaly at a head circumference further from the norm.

In other words, the newer standard allowed for more natural variation. Its not the head size but the brain and its development that matter here, and some babies can have smallish heads and still have normally developing brains. (The earlier standard found more cases but would have had more than three times the false-positive rate, meaning that it would label lots of healthy babies as having microcephaly.) The Pan American Health Organization uses an even more stringent cutoff, which would estimate 29,000 cases in this part of Brazil.

None of this means cases of microcephaly arent increasing, but the uptick doesnt appear to be as drastic as first reported. According to an update published on Wednesday by the Brazilian Health Ministry, there are currently 5,280 suspected cases of microcephaly or other central nervous system problems. Of these, 3,935 are still being investigated, 837 have been discarded as something else and 508 have been confirmed.

While the case numbers are sorted out, researchers are gathering and assessing evidence regarding Zika and microcephaly. The Pan American Health Organization reported in December that Zika virus had been identified in the amniotic fluid of two pregnant women whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly, and scientists also found RNA from the Zika virus in the brain of an infant with microcephaly who had died shortly after birth. A recent case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine described a European woman who developed symptoms of Zika while living in Brazil during the first trimester of a pregnancy. She went to Europe for the latter part of her pregnancy, and after an ultrasound revealed severe microcephaly, the pregnancy was terminated. Tests on the fetus showed Zika virus in the brain tissue. The finding of Zika in babies is compelling, but its still possible that its an incidental finding.

Zika would not be the first virus to lead to microcephaly  rubella can also cause the condition  but it would be the first virus of its kind known to trigger it. Other flaviviruses, such as dengue and West Nile, are not known to cause microcephaly, and thats perplexing, said Moore, the RAND pediatrician. There are plenty of other viruses in this family, and none of them cause this.

If the link between Zika and microcephaly is real, and the experts I talked with suspect that it is, then one outstanding question is why microcephaly hasnt been seen in other areas where Zika outbreaks have occurred. The virus was discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, and it has also appeared in Southeast Asia and French Polynesia.

Eskild Petersen, an expert in vaccines and infectious diseases at Aarhus University in Denmark, has posed this question to colleagues in Southeast Asia, and their answer was that the surveillance system was really poor. Its a problem thats common across areas that have experienced Zika.

In French Polynesia, an outbreak of Zika in 2013 and 2014 was not associated with microcephaly at the time, but when researchers went back later to look, they found 17 potential cases. Microcephaly thought to be linked to Zika still hasnt been seen in Brazils neighbor Colombia, which also is experiencing an outbreak, although its possible that most babies in Colombia whose mothers have been exposed to Zika havent been born yet.

Whats needed now are rigorous case-control studies (some of which are underway) of otherwise similar women whose babies had or didnt have microcephaly. That could help explain why some babies developed the condition and others didnt, Moore said. The good studies now underway will hopefully help nail down whether [the link between Zika and microcephaly] is strong, weak or non-existent, she said. There are numerous other possible explanations for the cases seen in northeast Brazil, including malnutrition, environmental factors or other viruses, and these have not yet been fully explored.

Even if Zika isnt causing new cases of microcephaly, were going to need science to help us understand what is. If there really is an uptick in microcephaly cases and they are not the result of Zika, then prematurely pinning them on the virus could obscure the true cause and stand in the way of doing something about it.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 23:59:02+00:00,The Warriors Odds Of Going 73-9,['Kyle Wagner'],"As things stand coming out of the All-Star break, the Warriors will probably catch Michael Jordans 1995-96 Bulls, which own the record of 72 wins, and are a little better than a coin flip to pass them.

Last time we checked in on Golden States run to 73 was back in December, when the model gave the Warriors a 54 percent chance of getting at least 72 wins and a 44.1 percent chance of at least 73. A little more than two months later, the Warriors are 48-4 and those chances are 69.8 percent to hit 72 and an even 54 percent to reach 73. From where we sit, at least, the Warriors now appear likely to break the 96 Bulls record.

WINS SIMS CHANCE OF EXACTLY THIS MANY WINS CHANCE OF AT LEAST THIS MANY WINS 59 1 <0.1% 100.0% 60 1 <0.1 >99.9 61 1 <0.1 >99.9 62 5 <0.1 >99.9 63 21 <0.1 >99.9 64 53 0.1 99.9 65 138 0.3 99.8 66 314 0.6 99.6 67 634 1.3 98.9 68 1368 2.7 97.7 69 2585 5.2 94.9 70 4008 8.0 89.8 71 5996 12.0 81.7 72 7857 15.7 69.8 73 8559 17.1 54.0 74 8031 16.1 36.9 75 5754 11.5 20.9 76 3207 6.4 9.3 77 1224 2.5 2.9 78 243 0.5 0.5 50,000 CARM-Elo simulations of the Warriors season with data through Feb. 18

Our colleagues at ESPN Stats & Info once again have a less optimistic outlook, today giving the Warriors a 37 percent chance of hitting 73 or more wins. The explanation for the difference in the two models is the same as it was in December, when we were also more bullish than our colleagues: We devised a different rating system, called CARM-Elo, which allows good (or bad) runs of play in the simulations to inform a teams simulated strength through the rest of the simulated season. Basically, this means that it allows for extreme performance to be reflected in the results, and the Warriors are certainly extreme.

Still, all of the back-and-forth over exactly how good the Warriors are is more than a little backward. Any serious debate over whether Golden State is an all-time team dried up months ago; all thats left now is the dreary accounting of decimal points next to the teams name. Screw that. NBA nerds slapfighting over some grandiose meaning of the Warriors is boring  its the spectacle that matters, the crossovers and no-looks and nonsense transition threes, and how those feats of skill translate to the stat sheet. That in mind, heres a bunch of Warriors facts aimed at appreciating the wild mess theyre accomplishing this season, rather than simply measuring it.

The Warriors would have to miss their next 545 3-pointers to bring their team mark of 42.4 percent down to the level of the league-worst Lakers, at 31.5 percent.

If the Warriors completely gave up the 3-pointer and shot none of them per game from this point forward, the Timberwolves, who take the fewest threes per game, would need 50 games to catch up in attempts and 83 games to catch up in makes, pulling even right around the 137th game of the season.

In order to match the best 3-point-percentage season of Reggie Millers career (42.9 percent), Steph Curry (45.4 percent from three on 10.8 per game) would have to miss 31 straight threes; to match Larry Birds best (42.7 percent) hed need to miss 34 straight; to match LeBrons mark this season (27.4 percent) he would have to miss 354 straight 3-point shots.

Currys 646 3-point attempts last season were more than those Miller and Bird seasons combined  and hes on pace to demolish that number this year.

This foolishness:

Remember that two-month stretch in the summer of 2009 when Steph Curry might have gone to the Knicks, before Donnie Walsh and Mike DAntoni went around telling anyone who would stand still long enough to hear it exactly why Curry would be a superstar? And remember how disappointing it was, then, when Curry landed on a Warriors team that didnt use him at all in the way fans dreamed he might be used by the Pringles stache? Well, Curry found his way into the seven-seconds-or-less offense anyway. By NBA.coms count (which can lag a game or two behind), the Warriors have taken 299 threes in the first seven seconds of the shot clock and made 48.5 percent of them. The next closest by percentage is Indiana, at 42.5 on 167 attempts; Houston, first in attempts with 301 (in four more games than Golden State) has made 38.9 percent of its own; and the Thunder have found a way to make just 31.6 percent on 171 attempts. On all field goals in the seven-seconds-or-less window, the Warriors have a 68 percent effective field-goal percentage  the next closest is the Cavs, at 63.4 percent. The Knicks, meanwhile, are last in the league at 51.4 percent.

The Warriors are shooting 46.3 percent from three on wide open (defender more than 6 feet away) threes, best in the league. They also lead the league in open threes at 41 percent and tight coverage threes at 37.3 percent. They do fall to fourth in very tight threes (36.1 percent) but have taken only 36 of those all season.

Steph Curry is 11 for 24 on threes from 30 feet or more, according to nbawowy.com. Six of those shots (and one of the makes) were from beyond half court, meaning hes 10 for 18 between 30 feet and the center line. (The rest of the Warriors are 1 for 14 from 30-plus.) Consider this a reminder that Ben Morris dug into Stephs imperious shot selection in December.

(While were digging out old charts, get a load of Draymond in these.)

Oh, heres a scatter plot of 3-point attempts vs. 3-point percentage since the 1979-80 season, the first year of the 3-pointer:

The Warriors create 70.4 points per game through assists. The rest of the league has a fairly linear progression from the bottom on up  the Lakers are the worst, at 43.2, and the figure creeps up team by team until it stops with the Hawks, in second place, at 60.3. That isnt adjusted for tempo (the Warriors play at the second-fastest pace in the league), but the Dubs are also comfortably in first in percentage of passes that are assists, are secondary assists or lead to free throws.

According to nbaminer.com, Curry has scored 10 straight points for his team 10 times, the most in the league (James Harden is second with nine); hes scored 15 straight team points three times (Harden is second again, two) and 20 straight once (only Paul George has also done that this season). Curry has scored five straight unanswered points 55 times (Harden is second with 47, followed by George and Klay Thompson at 30).

points 55 times (Harden is second with 47, followed by George and Klay Thompson at 30). Probably the most alarming thing about the Warriors this season is how thoroughly they are outpacing the Spurs, another omega-level team stalking around the league. Also according to nbaminer.com, the Warriors average first-quarter margin is +6.04. The Spurs are second at +2.98. The Spurs remain ahead of the Warriors on the overall marks, +12.7 to +12.5, but this difference is more than accounted for in the fourth quarter, where the Warriors are -0.12 and the Spurs are an NBA-best +2.56. The Warriors average margin per overtime period is +4.0, best in the league.

And heres the same display of possible records we generated for the Warriors above, but for the Spurs.",[]

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 19:24:13+00:00,Marco Rubios Paid Family Leave Plan May Not Work,['Andrew Flowers'],"Paid family leave is having a moment. Democrats and now some Republicans, including presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, want to give more workers the opportunity to take time off to care for a new baby or an ailing relative, all while still collecting a paycheck. Yet conservatives face a conundrum: how to expand paid leave without raising taxes or stipulating new regulations. Rubios plan avoids doing so, but at a cost  policy experts say it might not expand paid family leave all that much.

Currently, the United States is an extreme international outlier on lack of paid family leave and is the only Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development country not to mandate paid maternity leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, gives employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child or a sick family member. Only 13 percent of workers at private companies get paid family leave as a benefit from their employer.

Rubios paid family leave plan has been touted as the first of its kind for a GOP presidential candidate, which makes it significant on its own. The fact that you have a Republican presidential candidate talking about paid family leave is important. It says that there is a widespread recognition of its importance, said Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of Virginia and an expert in the economic effects of paid family leave policies.

A majority (67 percent) of American adults support paid time off for workers after the birth of a child, according to an AP-GfK poll conducted last year. Although Democrats are most enthusiastic (with 82 percent in favor), majorities of both Republicans and independents support paid leave, too.

A New York Times/CBS News poll released in June 2015 found similar bipartisan support: 88 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of Republicans favored requiring employers to offer paid leave to parents of new children and employees caring for sick family members.

If you actually talk to voters, this is not a partisan issue  it polls extremely well across partisan lines, said Sarah Jane Glynn, director of womens economic policy at the Center for American Progress.

Of course, support for a policy in theory doesnt equate to support for a specific proposal or piece of legislation, and policymakers disagree on how to expand paid family leave. Most Democrats have rallied behind the stalled FAMILY Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. Under their plan, qualified workers would receive up to 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or ailing family member. When on leave, employees would receive 66 percent of their wages, up to about $1,500 per week. They would fund this benefit through a 0.4 percentage point increase in payroll taxes (split evenly between employee and employer) and would set up a separate Social Security-like trust fund to manage it.

The left-leaning Center for American Progress estimates that the FAMILY Act would make 77 percent to 84 percent of all U.S. workers eligible for paid leave; however, the economic effects stemming from higher payroll taxes, both on businesses and employees, are uncertain.

Sanders and Clinton largely agree with the benefits offered in the FAMILY Act, but Clinton disagrees on how to fund them. Clinton, who has pledged not to raise taxes on middle-class households, prefers a tax on wealthier Americans, rather than a broad-based payroll tax increase.

Republicans have their own favored bill: The Strong Families Act, sponsored by Sens. Deb Fischer and Angus King. Rubios plan, which grants nonrefundable tax credits to employers that offer paid family leave, is largely modeled off it.

In a speech unveiling the plan in September at the Values Voter Summit, a gathering of social conservatives, Rubio was clear: his plan would not be a mandate on businesses. Instead, he proposes an employer tax incentive, or a subsidy to encourage businesses to offer paid leave to their employees. Specifically, his plan would give companies a 25 percent nonrefundable tax credit for offering four to 12 weeks of paid leave. In theory, offsetting the cost to businesses for paid leave would push more companies to offer it.

But thats not how employer tax subsidies often work out. As with all tax-credit programs, at the margin it probably wont get most employers to change, said economist Aparna Mathur, who is affiliated with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. She was skeptical that Rubios plan would compel companies not already doing so to offer paid leave. For many tax incentives, most existing evidence indicates that companies would be doing it anyway, she said, pointing to the research and development tax credit (which lets businesses deduct R&D investments from their tax bill) as an example. In other words, Rubios plan might just subsidize companies that already offer paid family leave. Still, Mathur said it was a step in the right direction.

The Rubio campaign declined to respond specifically to criticism of his plans effectiveness, but communications director Alex Conant said, Marco is open to other proposals, so long as they do not raise taxes or create new mandates.

Syracuse economist Sarah Hamersma studied the effect of two tax credits initiated in the 1990s to encourage businesses to hire disadvantaged workers: the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and Welfare-to-Work credit. Her research concluded that those tax incentives were vastly underutilized and ineffective at encouraging hiring in the targeted groups.

Although her work is frequently cited by critics of Rubios proposal, Hamersma sees the policies as apples and oranges. The employer subsidies she studied were trying to get firms to hire certain people, and the paid family leave credits would be pushing for a more subtle behavioral change, she said; that is, the credits would apply to workers a firm has already hired (and hence pose no risk to the firms using the credit). But because the plan offers only a 25 percent credit, Id be surprised if it made a huge difference in increasing paid family leave coverage, she said.

Whether or not Rubios plan is effective at expanding paid family leave, both conservatives and progressives agree that paid family leave is becoming more popular among voters. Up until this point, paid family leave has been a Democratic issue, but going forward itll be a bipartisan issue, said W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist at the University of Virginia who is also affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.

Rubios proposal is not my favorite, the Center for American Progresss Glynn said, as it falls short of being comprehensive. But that hes talking about it at all reflects a real shift.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 12:43:17+00:00,Ted Cruz Has A Huge Math Problem,['David Wasserman'],"Ted Cruz may have a knack for the debate stage and a disciplined, data-driven campaign, but he may also have a huge viability problem.

Cruzs short-term dilemma has received plenty of attention: Donald Trump is on the verge of a big victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, according to most polls, and could easily capture all 50 of the Palmetto States delegates. And if Cruz cant beat Trump in South Carolina  a Southern state with a large proportion of evangelical and very conservative voters, Cruzs supposed bread and butter  what SEC Primary states can he win on Super Tuesday, March 1?

But Cruz also faces a longer-term, potentially more devastating math problem that has received less attention: The states that are his most natural fits  those with the highest proportions of evangelical voters  are also the least likely to award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. In other words, Cruzs votes may not translate into delegates nearly as efficiently as his rivals.

An examination of the GOP delegate landscape shows that in states where evangelical Protestants are at least 30 percent of the population, just 22 percent of delegates will be awarded on a winner-take-all basis, compared to 47 percent of delegates in other states:

This delegate allocation matrix puts Cruzs campaign at a serious disadvantage. For example, if Cruz wins the primary in his home state of Texas by one vote, hell probably win a handful more delegates than his nearest competitor. By contrast, if Marco Rubio or Trump win Florida by one vote, either would win a whopping 99 more delegates than his nearest competitor.

If you only count states that vote after South Carolina, the winner-take-all versus proportional gap gets even more daunting for Cruz. In fact, after South Carolina, the only winner-take-all states with a high proportion of evangelical Protestants are Indiana, Missouri and West Virginia  all of which are winner-take-all by congressional district.

These disparities could help explain why Cruzs position in betting markets remains very anemic  a good deal behind both Trump and Rubio  even though he is doing fairly well in the polls. Cruz ranks second in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of national polls, and the newest national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey shows him leading the GOP field for the first time at 28 percent, with 26 percent for Trump and 17 percent for Rubio.

Many pundits had initially predicted that Trump would fade, producing a Cruz-Rubio face-off for the nomination. But the cruel mathematical reality for Cruz could be hinting at a final showdown between Trump and Rubio, with Cruz and others potentially siphoning off enough delegates that neither Trump nor Rubio reach a majority of 2,472 delegates before the convention.

In fact, if Cruzs prospects are suddenly looking dimmer, the odds of a contested convention in Cleveland may be higher than ever.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 15:47:49+00:00,The Party Is Deciding On Rubio,['Harry Enten'],"One of the more interesting debates so far this election cycle has been over whether the party decides. Do party elites  politicians, activists, media, etc.  have enough power to influence the nominating contest? Can they pick a winner? Can they stop someone from winning? If so, then Donald Trump, who doesnt have a single endorsement from a sitting governor or member of Congress, should have little shot at the Republican nomination.

For much of this campaign, however, Republican Party elites werent deciding. Most Republican governors and members of Congress havent endorsed anyone, and the pace of endorsements has been slower than in past campaigns. But thats starting to change: More GOP elites are taking the plunge.

In fact, by a hair  and for the moment  Marco Rubio has overtaken the pace set by at least one past Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Rubio has picked up the endorsements of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas and Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina this week. Indeed, Rubio has greatly increased his endorsement pace since the Iowa caucuses, picking up 42 weighted endorsement points in the past two-and-a-half weeks, according to the FiveThirtyEight endorsement tracker. Thats nearly half of the 85 points he has overall. All the other candidates who remain in the race have received only 4 endorsement points combined since the Iowa caucuses. The second-place candidate, Jeb Bush, has 51 points, but most of those came early in the campaign, when Bush looked far more formidable; hes earned just 17 points since September.

Thats not to say the party has settled on Rubio. Of the available GOP endorsement points, Rubio has only a little over 10 percent. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has nearly 80 percent of the Democratic points available. But Rubio is starting to do better than some previous endorsement leaders at this point in the campaign.

Rubio has more endorsement points than Democrat Dick Gephardt did at a comparable point in the 1988 campaign; he led the field with 57 endorsement points. Rubio is also outpacing Ronald Reagans 1980 mark:

And Rubios post-Iowa uptick is extra good news for him: History has shown that newer endorsements are more predictive of success than stale ones. Gephardt, for example, hadnt picked up a single endorsement point post-Iowa at this point in the campaign  and he didnt win the nomination.

The question, of course, is whether any of this matters. In this seemingly anti-establishment year, its tempting to say that it doesnt. Id argue, though, that if Rubio can keep up his pace, it could make a difference.

The biggest problem for the anti-Trump crowd is that its support has been divided; Rubio, Bush and John Kasich are splitting the anti-Trump vote (its harder to say how Ted Cruz fits in here). Trumps support has been fairly stable in national polls, at about 35 percent, over the past month, and its starting to look like he has a core group of supporters who will stick with him come hell or high water. On the other hand, 35 percent is not all that close to 50 percent. If Rubio can coalesce the anti-Trump vote and get to a one-on-one with Trump, Rubio may be able to come out on top. These endorsements could be a signal to anti-Trump voters to rally around Rubio. They may also be a signal to Bush and Kasich to clear the way, that Rubio is Republican elites best chance to stop Trump. Of course, in a campaign as wacky as 2016 has been, it may not work.

These problems, puzzles and riddles come from lots of top-notch puzzle folks around the world, including you, the readers. And readers, I need more riddles! Email me with submissions.

Youll find this weeks puzzle below.

Mull it over on your commute, dissect it on your lunch break, and argue about it with your friends and lovers. When youre ready, submit your answer using the form at the bottom. Ill reveal the solution next week, and a correct submission (chosen at random) will earn a shoutout in this column. Important small print: To be eligible for the shoutout, I need to receive your correct answer before 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday  have a great weekend!

Before we get to the new puzzle, lets return to last weeks. Congratulations to  Guy D. Moore  of Darmstadt, Germany, our big winner. You can find a solution to the previous Riddler at the bottom of this post.

Now, heres this weeks Riddler, a take on a classic that captures the essence of one of my greatest phobias. Just reading it fills me with panic and dread. Enjoy!

Theres an airplane with 100 seats, and there are 100 ticketed passengers each with an assigned seat. They line up to board in some random order. However, the first person to board is the worst person alive, and just sits in a random seat, without even looking at his boarding pass. Each subsequent passenger sits in his or her own assigned seat if its empty, but sits in a random open seat if the assigned seat is occupied. What is the probability that you, the hundredth passenger to board, finds your seat unoccupied?

Extra credit: Its time to offer up a  Coolest Riddler Extension Award . Spice up this travel hellscape for your fellow readers. Change the size of the plane, the ticketing scheme, the boarding rules, or something far more creative than I can think of. Submit a description and analysis in the form below, or shoot me a link to your work on Twitter. Well publish a winner next week.

Need a hint? You can try asking me nicely. Want to submit a puzzle or problem? Email me.

And heres the solution to last weeks Riddler, concerning a dog on the hunt, a duck on the lam, and a circular pond. As I warned last week, this one is really tough. Only 3.1 percent of submissions were correct, a new record low. But I heartily applaud the effort. As every famous old person has been reported to have said, Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

The most commonly submitted answer, by far, was , the mathematical constant roughly equal to 3.14. That answer is wrong. Its correct if the duck follows a very simple strategy: make a beeline toward the shore opposite where the dog starts. In that case, the duck would have to cover a distance equal to the ponds radius to escape, but the dog would have to cover a distance equal to half the ponds circumference to catch it, which is  times farther.

But give the duck some credit! The duck can be far cleverer than that. The duck can escape a dog that is much faster  in fact, the duck can escape a dog that is about 4.6033 times faster than it!

The basic idea is that the duck should swim out from the center of the pond a bit, and start swimming in circles around the ponds center. Specifically, it should swim out a distance 1/4.6033 of the radius, and begin circling the center. The dogs only viable strategy is to follow the duck as closely as it can. Since the duck is swimming around in a smaller circle than the dog is running, the duck has the angular advantage, and the dog will fall behind. The math involved is first figuring out the ducks optimal small circle, and then figuring out when and in what direction the duck should ultimately bolt for the shore. The ducks optimal strategy will look roughly like this, cooked up by Friend of the RiddlerTM Zach Wissner-Gross:

Im going to spare you all the gnarly math details to arrive at that 4.6 number. For those who take pleasure in the gnarly details, see this thorough explanation at DataGenetics, or this one at Mathematical Recreations. (The first swaps a monster for the dog and a row boater for the duck, but otherwise the problems are the same.) Or follow along with a discussion of the solution from the great folks over at BoardGameGeek.

You can also play a version of this duck-escape game yourself (you take on the role of the duck, recast as a ladybug) here.

Before we go, heres an embed of a tweet of a video taken of computer screen displaying a visualization of dots representing a duck and a dog, from FotRTM Jon Wiesman:

fivethirtyeight,2014-10-16 16:33:09+00:00,The Playoff Implications Of Every Game For Every NFL Team,"['Reuben Fischer-baum', 'Mike Beuoy']","Playoff Implications is a phrase you usually dont hear until the final weeks of the NFL regular season, but almost every regular season game has playoff implications. In the early going, however, it can be difficult to figure out just what those implications are, and how much is riding on each game.

Most other major sports leagues play a greater number of regular season games, and thus the playoff picture in those sports evolves in a more incremental fashion. The pace can seem glacial at times for MLB, and inevitable and foregone when it comes to the NBA. But with just 16 regular season games, the NFLs playoff landscape can change dramatically over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. And these tectonic shifts take place throughout the season, not just in those final weeks of December.

With a week or two left in the season, the eye test usually suffices for judging which games will shape the playoff picture. But in mid-October there are far too many possibilities for the unassisted human mind to make sense of. We can only speak in general terms. For example, we know the playoff chances for the New Orleans Saints will improve with a victory this Sunday over the Detroit Lions. But by how much? And how far would they drop with a loss? Expanding our focus, what other teams have a vested interest in the outcome of this game? One would expect Carolinas playoff chances to improve with a Saints loss, given that the Saints are their division rival. But once again, by how much?

To answer these questions, weve created a weekly feature that measures the playoff implications of each game. To do this, you need to be able to simulate the remainder of the season multiple times and analyze the results. And in order to simulate the season, you need a way to rank all 32 teams, and use that ranking to create outcome probabilities for future games. Weve been doing just that with FiveThirtyEights Elo rankings. But the Elo ratings, simple and beautiful, arent the only word on NFL rankings. For this feature were going to turn to the wisdom of the crowd instead, and use a ranking system one of the authors developed based on betting markets. In stock market terms, think of it as technical analysis in lieu of fundamental analysis.

Well get into the methodology in a moment but first the results. Think of each interactive table below as a playoff implications cheat sheet for this weeks upcoming games. (If you hover over a colored square, youll see details for that game.)

UPDATE (Oct. 17, 12:30 p.m.): The interactive tables above have been updated to include Thursday nights game, which now shows no playoff implications because its result is included in the playoff chances (the text of the article has not been updated).

Reading the table across tells you which teams are affected by any particular game. Reading the table down tells you which games matter most to any given team. For example, if youre a Texans fan, what games should you care about this week, how much should you care about them, and who do you want to win? The column headers are sortable, so clicking on the HOU column tells you to care about HOU @ PIT, ATL @ BAL, CIN @ IND, NYJ @ NE, CLE @ JAC, and KC @ SD  in that order. And you want the Texans, Falcons, Bengals, Jets, Jaguars and Chiefs to win.

My rankings start from the assumption that the NFL gambling market is efficient, and then attempts to determine how that efficient market ranks each of the 32 NFL teams. Unfortunately, Vegas doesnt actually share its rankings with the general public, but with a little reverse-engineering, we can arrive at a pretty good guess at what they are. We start with the point spread. For Thursday nights game, the New England Patriots are a 9.5-point favorite at home against the New York Jets. Since home field advantage is worth about 2.5 points, the market thinks the Patriots are 7 points better than the Jets when playing on a neutral field.

Armed with this interpretation, we then take the point spreads from each game and for multiple weeks and run a simple linear regression to arrive at a consensus ranking. The process is akin to drawing a map of the United States but nobody tells you a citys location. Instead, they only tell you how far away each city is from another city (e.g. Los Angeles is 1,700 miles away from Chicago, Chicago is 165 miles from Indianapolis, and so on). To further complicate matters, our map moves over time, making earlier distance measurements less reliable. For example, the Steelers opened the season as a 6-point favorite at home against the Browns. If the market were to set that point spread today, Pittsburgh would most likely drop to just a 2.5-point favorite, as the Steelers have fallen short of preseason expectations, and the Browns have exceeded them. So, the ranking methodology gives more weight to recent point spread data in an attempt to get the most up-to-date market evaluation of each team.

Now that we have a ranking system that assigns a probability to each future regular season game outcome, the next step is to simulate the season multiple times (50,000 times to be exact). After simulating win/loss records, we apply the NFL playoff seeding rules (plus tiebreakers) and summarize the results. There are already several sites that do these types of simulations for the purpose of producing team playoff odds (including FiveThirtyEight). For this feature, were going to go a bit deeper than that.

Instead of focusing on each teams overall playoff odds, lets instead focus on each game. Well use the New Orleans-Detroit game as an example. Of the 50,000 simulation runs, there were precisely 30,180 (or about 60 percent) that resulted in a Lions victory, and 19,820 that resulted in a Saints victory. Lets now focus on those two samples in isolation. Of the 30,180 simulations in which the Saints lost, they made the playoffs 8,273 times, or 27 percent. Of the 19,820 simulations in which the Saints won, they made the playoffs 9,172 times, or 46 percent. Put simply, the Saints playoff odds could swing by a not-insignificant 19 percent as a result of their game against the Lions. (The games with the most cumulative influence on the overall playoff picture (leverage) are listed at left).

We can repeat this calculation for every game and every team. The result: A measure of how much every game matters to every team.",[]
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-20 00:47:45+00:00,Whats Changed in Harper Lees Hometown Since Mockingbird,"['Anne Li', 'Ben Casselman']","Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.

Thats how Scout Finch describes the steadfastly Southern setting of Harper Lees beloved novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. Maycomb is a fictional city, but its based on Lees birthplace and childhood home of Monroeville, in Monroe County, Alabama, where Lee died on Friday.

Monroe County was the perfect model for the setting of the Depression-era novel. According to 1930 census data, farmers like the novels Cunningham family made up 74 percent of the county. Monroe was about half black, half white, but whites were better off by a variety of a measures. While Scouts father Atticus read to her every night, 25.8 percent of the black population was illiterate. Only 3 percent of the white population couldnt read.

Eighty-four years later, Monroe County has become smaller, whiter and richer, but the racial disparities Lee illustrated in her book still exist. We dug up the census data from 1930, when the book was set; 1960, when the book was published; and 2014, the most recent year for which data is available.

Overall, Monroe County is still poor, with a 29.2 percent poverty rate and a 41.2 percent child poverty rate, both well above the rate for the U.S. overall. Nor has the racial gap narrowed much since the novel was published, at least in Alabama as a whole (county-level data isnt available): In 1960, more than 75 percent of African-Americans in Alabama lived in poverty, which is greater than twice the white poverty rate of about 30 percent. In 2014, Alabamas black poverty rate was 33.5 percent, still about double the 15.6 percent rate among whites.

The racial income gap appears to have narrowed but remains wide. In 2014, median household income for white families in Monroe County was $38,188; for blacks it was barely half that, at $18,584. Equivalent data isnt available at a county or even state level for 1960, but in the South as a whole, the typical non-white family earned about $20,000 in 1959, one third of the amount earned by the typical white family.

And finally, what ultimately shattered Scouts childhood innocence was the wrongful jury conviction of Tom Robinson, a black man, whom Atticus defended. Data on wrongful conviction  and certainly the kind of willfully wrongful prosecution depicted in the book  doesnt exist, for obvious reasons. But more than half a century after To Kill A Mockingbird was published, issues of race and the criminal justice system remain central to the national conversation, and there have been widespread protests around the country at the way black citizens are treated by the law enforcement system. According to data from the Sentencing Project, the incarceration rate of blacks in Alabama is three and a half times as high as it is for whites. That disparity is among the smallest in the country.",[]

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 12:00:07+00:00,No One Can Agree How Much The Presidential Candidates Tax Plans Will Cost,['Ben Casselman'],"This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news. Were still experimenting with the format, so tell us what you think. Email me or drop a note in the comments. And thank you for all the great feedback so far!

This week, the Tax Policy Center  a well-regarded non-partisan think tank  issued a report saying that Ted Cruzs tax plan would cost the government $8.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Which is fine, except that back in October, the Tax Foundation  a well-regarded nonpartisan think tank  looked at the same plan and estimated it would cost $768 billion. Even in the world of federal budgets, an $8 trillion gap is a lot of money.

Meanwhile, on the Democratic side of the race, a fight broke out among economists over the likely impact of Bernie Sanderss tax and spending plans. Others have covered the battle in more depth, but the short version is that Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts economist who has consulted for the Sanders campaign, released a report estimating that Sanderss proposals would create millions of new jobs, increase household incomes by tens of thousands of dollars and boost the overall size of the economy by more than a third. (The Sanders campaign has embraced Friedmans analysis. According to The Washington Posts Jim Tankersley, however, Friedman is not planning on voting for Sanders.) Mainstream Democratic economists responded by saying, more or less, Youve got to be kidding me; former Obama administration economic adviser Austan Goolsbee likened the Sanders plan to magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars. The Tax Foundation, for its part, estimates the Sanders proposals would shrink the economy by nearly 10 percent over the long term.

If the supposed experts cant even agree on the direction of a plans impact, is there any hope for a normal voter? Yes  but it helps to understand a few things about how experts reach these estimates, and why they differ so widely.

First, this weeks jumbled headlines notwithstanding, there is actually a lot that the experts do agree on. The Republican plans, especially Donald Trumps, would reduce federal revenues by trillions of dollars. Sanderss plan would increase both taxing and spending by trillions (the disagreement surrounds whether the new taxes would pay for all the new spending).

IMPACT ON FEDERAL REVENUE OVER 10 YEARS (TRILLIONS) CANDIDATE TAX POLICY CENTER (STATIC) TAX FOUNDATION (STATIC) TAX FOUNDATION (DYNAMIC) Jeb Bush -$6.8 $-3.7 $-1.6 Ted Cruz -8.6 -3.7 -0.8 Marco Rubio -6.8 -6.1 -2.4 Donald Trump -9.5 -12.0 -10.1 Hillary Clinton  +0.5 +0.2 Bernie Sanders  +13.6 +9.8 Estimated impacts of candidates tax plans Source: Tax Policy Center, Tax Foundation

Second, most of the disagreement among experts is about the broader economic impact of the various plans, not the plans themselves. Heres what I mean by that: Figuring out how much extra money a tweak to the tax code would bring in, or how much a new policy would cost, is relatively straightforward. This is what is known as static analysis  taken in isolation, how would these plans change things? Economists can usually agree on an answer, or at least come close. (Emphasis on usually. Some proposals, such as Sanderss single-payer health system or Cruzs value-added tax, are so dramatic that experts reach wildly different estimates of their impact.)

The trouble is, these plans dont exist in isolation: Changes in tax policy have far-reaching ripple effects on the economy. In theory, there is little doubt that we should try to take such dynamic effects into account, but in practice there is often significant disagreement among economists about how exactly to do so. The Tax Foundation, which tends to lean to the right, thinks the tax increases that Sanders is proposing will slow the economy, further reducing tax receipts (since there will be less money to tax) and making the revenue impact look larger than it would under a static model. Friedman, at UMass, thinks the extra government spending that Sanders is proposing will speed up the economy, making the plan less expensive than it looks at first.

Unfortunately, the Tax Policy Center  which, despite some criticism from Republicans in the last presidential race, is probably the closest thing out there to a neutral observer  doesnt produce dynamic estimates. But its well-regarded static estimates can still be a useful baseline. Take the TPCs recent analysis of Rubios tax plan, which the center concluded would reduce federal revenue by $6.8 trillion over 10 years, or about 2.6 percent of economic output. Thats close to half of all discretionary spending. Think of that as a worst-case scenario for Rubio. The Tax Foundations dynamic analysis  which concludes Rubios plan would cut revenues by $2.4 trillion, or about 1 percent of economic output  is, if not a best-case scenario, then at least an optimistic one. (The range of credible outcomes is wider for Cruzs plan because it has more moving parts.)

Not all points along that spectrum of possible outcomes are equally plausible, of course. Most mainstream economists think Friedmans analysis of Sanderss plan is based on unrealistic assumptions  and I tend to agree. (Economists have directed their harshest criticism at Friedmans analysis, not at the Sanders plan itself, much of which is basically a more aggressive version fairly standard liberal policies.) But that doesnt mean mainstream economists are right. At a certain point, voters still have to decide who they believe.

Too big to fail?

When Narayana Kocherlakota stepped down as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last year, he seemed certain to leave the Fed a more boring place. (I assure you, this is possible.) Kocherlakota was famous among Fed watchers for pulling a rare about-face on policy in the aftermath of the recession. Once a hawk who feared inflation, Kocherlakota became the Feds most outspoken dove, advocating for aggressive action to bring down unemployment.

Few expected Kocherlakotas successor, Neel Kashkari, to follow in his footsteps. A former Goldman Sachs banker, government official and failed California gubernatorial candidate, Kashkari had all the hallmarks of a conventional central banker.

But maybe Kashkari will keep Kocherlakotas maverick flame burning after all. We still dont know much about his views on monetary policy, but in his first speech in the new job Tuesday, Kashkari made headlines by calling for a major overhaul of Wall Street. Kashkari, who as a Treasury official under George W. Bush oversaw the bailout of the financial industry, said the big banks remain too big to fail and either need to be much more heavily regulated or else broken up. He followed up that speech by telling the Financial Times that the bailouts had eroded Americans trust in government and that the Fed needs to do more to respond to widespread economic anger.

Recession watch

With China slowing down, Europe in tatters, the stock market slumping and oil prices falling through the floor, U.S. consumers have been pretty much the only thing keeping the economy going. So it was more than a little concerning when the Commerce Department last month said that retail sales had fallen in December.

Well, never mind that. This week, the government not only said sales rose in January; it revised its December estimate to say sales rose then, too. Neither gain was particularly impressive, but at least things are headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, a key measure of the industrial sector showed better than expected growth in January, suggesting U.S. manufacturers are surviving the global slowdown.

On the other hand, Larry Summers thinks theres a one-in-three chance the U.S. will fall into a recession in the next year. So that isnt great.

Number of the week

In 1952, 2.7 million workers walked off the job (or were locked out by their employers) in 470 major work stoppages (those involving at least 1,000 workers) across the U.S. Last year, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 12 strikes and lockouts, involving just 47,000 workers. As the chart below shows, its been a long decline, which broadly mirrors the decades-long erosion of union membership.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 19:54:36+00:00,Non-Stars Like Channing Frye Are The Best Kind Of Trade Deadline Pickup,['Neil Paine'],"Unlike last year, the 2016 NBA trade deadline was a bit of a snoozer. Nineteen players were dealt on Thursday, deadline day itself  the 12th-most since 1987. In the traditionally busy two weeks leading up to the cutoff, however, only seven others were moved, which means the raw activity around this years deadline was basically average. Quality wasnt exactly bursting out over quantity, either. As a group, the traded players averaged almost exactly zero wins above replacement per 82 games this season, the eighth-lowest rate among trade deadlines since 87. (Of course, it could be worse  sometimes an entire crop of trade targets can average out well below the replacement level, as happened in 1992.)

Most of this years trades were made by teams jockeying for playoff position (Charlottes Courtney Lee pickup comes to mind), collecting future assets (Detroit snagged Tobias Harris and Donatas Motiejunas in separate deals this week) or dumping disgruntled players (Markieff Morris and Lance Stephenson were sent packing by the Suns and Clippers, respectively). These are the kinds of incremental moves that help a franchise in the long run. But nobody would characterize them as blockbusters, and hardly any involved the handful of teams that have a chance to win the 2015-16 NBA championship.

If any contender received consensus praise at the deadline, though, it was Cleveland, which snagged Channing Frye for Anderson Varejao, Jared Cunningham and a couple of draft picks. The advanced analytics have always crushed hard on Frye  he currently ranks eighth among power forwards in ESPNs Real Plus-Minus, ahead of Anthony Davis (!)  with his classic stretch-big mix of long-distance shooting, decent-enough rebounding and surprisingly solid defensive metrics. (To that last point, RPM actually thinks Fryes defense is a far bigger contributor to his bottom-line impact than his offense.) Lets face it  nobody will be shocked if Frye ends up hitting a huge shot or two for the Cavs during whats probably going to be another deep run in the Eastern Conference playoffs.

And when it comes to deadline pickups, players like Frye often make a more indelible postseason mark than the types of big-name superstars everyone was hoping to see moved Thursday, anyway.

Statistically, the best deadline acquisition of the past 30 years was Clyde Drexler  clearly not a role player, even in his twilight  who produced 5.5 WAR for the Rockets after getting shipped to Houston for Otis Thorpe in 1995. Drexler went on to help Houston capture its second straight NBA title, but that makes him an exception among hyper-productive deadline pickups:

Historically, productive deadline pickups dont often go hand in hand with deep playoff runs. They can help their new teams bottom lines  since 1987, each additional WAR produced by a newcomer after the deadline has been associated with a 0.9-point improvement to his teams efficiency differential, compared with the teams differential before the trade. But oftentimes those players are shipped into situations where no amount of productivity can keep the ship from sinking or drag an average roster to playoff greatness.

And even the stars who go to good teams can arrive to mixed results. Drexler, like Jamal Mashburn in 1997 and Dikembe Mutombo in 2001, played well after landing in his new destination, but his teams net efficiency sank dramatically down the stretch of the regular season before righting itself in the playoffs.

Furthermore, because trades involve, uh, trade-offs between teams, sometimes star deals simply re-allocate strengths from one side of the ball to the other. The biggest post-deadline boost in offensive efficiency since 1987 belongs to the 1999 New Jersey Nets, which added offensive dynamo Stephon Marbury and improved their efficiency at that end by 11.6 points per 100 possessions ... but also got worse on defense by 6.6 points per 100 possessions. (Marbury didnt exactly lock opponents down on D.)

Likewise, the biggest boost in defensive efficiency belongs to last years Jazz, which improved by 10.6 points per 100 possessions on D after jettisoning defensive sieve Enes Kanter and installing Stifle Tower Rudy Gobert as starting center ... but also got worse by 2.3 points per 100 possessions on offense. Thats still a clear win for the Jazz, but it shows that blockbuster deadline trades rarely come off perfectly clean, without some downside to go with the benefits.

Which brings us back to Frye and the Cavaliers. Fryes no superstar  his wins added are modest despite his impressive RPM because he logged only 17 minutes a night in Orlando, a number that isnt likely to increase given Clevelands existing frontcourt situation. But hes in whats historically been a sweet spot for deadline pickups: Hes coming to an existing title contender at very little cost, where hell be asked to fill a specific (yet important) role. There are no guarantees on the NBA trade market, but low-risk/moderate-reward moves like the one the Cavs made to grab Frye are often the deadline deals most associated with solid playoff outcomes.",[]
fivethirtyeight,2015-02-18 12:48:04+00:00,Every NBA Teams Chance Of Winning In Every Minute Across Every Game,"['Allison Mccann', 'Mike Beuoy']","Can you summarize the NBA season in one chart? With 794 games, more than 152,000 possessions and some 372,000 plays, probably not, but weve given it a shot. What you see above is the 2014-15 seasons win probabilities, summarized. At any point in an NBA game, each team has a probability of winning based on the time remaining, the score and the situation (i.e. after a made shot, shooting foul, etc.). In the chart, each teams in-game win probability is averaged over each minute of regulation time. Its like watching a win-loss record develop in real time.

The win probability model that provides the foundation of the chart uses data from 13 NBA seasons (2000 to 2012). The model is not based on simulations, but rather it does its best to reflect how NBA games are actually played, won and lost.

One of our favorite findings: The Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks share a similar win-loss record, but theyve taken different paths to get to that point. The Warriors have shown more dominance throughout games, often building early, insurmountable leads. The Hawks, in contrast, dont pull away until the fourth quarter.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 18:08:30+00:00,What Happens Now That We Know Gravitational Waves Are Real?,[],"Last week, physics had a rare moment in the headlines after scientists announced they had made the first direct observations of gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime predicted by Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity. It was an astounding technological and scientific feat, decades in the making. Taking a page from our colleagues on the politics desk, who gather round to chat regularly, we asked some of our favorite astrophysicist-types to join us for a chat about the waves, what they mean for science, and what may come next.

Our participants:

Christie Aschwanden: Lead science writer at FiveThirtyEight.

Lead science writer at FiveThirtyEight. Alan Lightman: Physicist, novelist and professor of the practice of the humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His most recent book on science is The Accidental Universe.

Physicist, novelist and professor of the practice of the humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His most recent book on science is The Accidental Universe. Katie Mack: Theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Melbourne, researching dark matter, particle physics and the early universe.

Theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Melbourne, researching dark matter, particle physics and the early universe. Derek van Westrum: Physicist with NOAAs National Geodetic Survey, specializing in terrestrial gravity measurements and their applications.

Christie: The big gravitational wave announcement happened about a week ago now, and the hoopla has mostly died down. Ive gathered you all here today to discuss whats next. How does this discovery frame our thinking about the universe? And where will it take us? What can we do now that we couldnt do before?

Alan: No one doubted the existence of gravitational waves. We absolutely but indirectly inferred their existence with the binary pulsar a couple of decades ago.

Katie: And that won a Nobel Prize!

Alan: Yes, the new discovery  the direct detection  will also win a Nobel, probably for Thorne, Weiss and Drever. [Thats Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss, and Ronald Drever, the founders of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) that detected the waves.]

Christie: So given that this is anything but a surprise, what makes it such a big deal? And, maybe what Id like to know even more: Why has this captured our imagination?

Derek: I think its literally a whole new kind of telescope. We can see (or maybe hear is better) things that were invisible before.

Alan: Better to use hear than see because this is not electromagnetic radiation, like light and X-rays. It is the vibrations of space, more like sound waves.

Katie: I think that the discovery, as a discovery, is immensely exciting. But the part that makes this thing game-changing and truly revolutionary is that its the start of gravitational wave astronomy. An entirely new field!

Christie: So a new tool AND a new field!

Katie: Yes, absolutely.

Alan: Its a big deal for at least two reasons. As Derek says, it is a new kind of telescope. But also, it is a triumph of technology. It is the most sensitive instrument ever created by humankind. We will be able to see things we couldnt see before  like oscillating black holes, quiet supernova, lumps in the early universe.

Katie: Up until now, weve been able to observe the universe with light and with certain kinds of cosmic particles. But this is fundamentally different  were looking at spacetime itself.

Derek: As an instrumentalist myself, that was the truly astonishing part. That this thing remotely worked! Its incredible technology.

Katie: Yeah, the technological achievement is mind-blowing. I also love how much just came together perfectly for this. Until a decade or so ago, we didnt have reliable simulations of black hole collisions. People had tried to get black holes to merge in numerical simulations and had to fudge something or the code would break. It was only in something like 2005 that a simulation was really successful, and what LIGO saw was pretty much exactly what the simulations predicted.

Alan: That was only a problem with the simulations, We knew that black holes would have to spiral in and merge.

Christie: I love the idea that we can use this to hear the early universe.

Derek: So Ill let you both go for it on the astronomy side of things, but there is a separate chapter to Christies question: Are there important outcomes of this closer to home?

Alan: Closer to home might be a matter of coaxing the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health to fund long-term projects without immediate payoff.

Derek: I would just add, as a taxpayer, I would pay cold, hard cash to know that the equivalent of three solar masses disappeared into gravity waves, and that was brighter than the visible universe. Incredible. But, that may just be me.

Alan: I wish all taxpayers were like you.

Christie: Me too!

Katie: Im not sure how universal that is, but I definitely think there will be spinoffs to both the technology and the discovery itself that will have benefits we cant even imagine yet.

Alan: Certainly to the technology. But I dont think we need spinoffs to justify this. It is the same as justifying ballet.

Katie: I dont need spinoffs to justify this, but it doesnt hurt to point out to taxpayers that fundamental physics leading to new technology is a long and proven tradition!

Derek: Thats what I found so interesting about this particular announcement: Its mind-blowing in itself, but if you wanted to justify it in terms of an investment, there really are things we can point to in the sensors that will have great payoffs. In manufacturing, for example.

Christie: Ive noticed that gravitational waves seem to have captured the publics imagination in a way that many basic science discoveries dont. Do any of you have theories as to why?

Alan: For one thing, people love black holes, like dinosaurs. Also, the scientists were very very media savvy and orchestrated this with the press for months in advance.

Katie: I think a lot of people are picking up on how excited the physicists are, so that might be part of it. (I mean everyone I know who is involved in this stuff is positively giddy.) But also, people love black holes. And spacetime.

Derek: And they made it audible!

Katie: *chirp!*

Alan: Yep. But when we detect much bigger black holes, they wont be audible.

Christie: Yeah, I couldnt stop listening to the chirps!

Derek: I still like to think of them like whale songs ...

Katie: One of the things that makes this exciting for me is that its evidence of a massively violent event in the distant universe, but were not just seeing some vague image in the telescope. The instrument is actually being deformed by the gravitational waves. This is gravity coming to your house and moving your stuff.

Alan: Everything about this discovery is theatrical: 40 years in the making, generations of grad students, two 2.5-mile long tubes, black holes, audible signal.

Christie: Alan, do you think theres a novel in here?

Alan: There is certainly a movie in this. Janna Levin is about to come out with a nonfiction book on LIGO, where she interviewed all of the principals.

Derek: And Alan  it comes ~exactly 100 years after Einstein thought of it

Alan: Yes, thats another part of the theater. It was made for Hollywood, but its serious stuff.

Katie: Everybody loves a story about Einstein being a genius.

Christie: Einstein had some uncertainty about gravitational waves, right?

Alan: Yes, he did. He thought that the wiggles might be wiggles of the coordinate lines, like wiggling latitude lines on a globe, rather than real wiggles in space.

Christie: Does this feel like a moment that will give physics some propulsion in the coming years? Not just for those in the field, but in the publics mind? Do you expect this success will make it easier to get funding for the next big project?

Derek: I think this gets back to justifying the ballet.

Christie: Yeah, we shouldnt have to! But the reality is, we do.

Katie: I think this will definitely give the LISA project some propulsion. (Possibly literally.)

Derek: The thing that it isnt obvious at first is that this project is actually relatively easy to point to as an investment: The techniques with quartz fibers and interferometers will be very useful in all types of manufacturing. And talk about delayed payoff: 100 years after general relativity was invented, there are practical uses for it.

Katie: There are lots of examples of delayed payoffs from obscure fundamental physics. Antimatter has led to PET scans, quantum tunnelling to certain kinds of transistors, etc.

Alan: Yes. The history of science is full of pure ideas and discoveries that then turned out to have practical application.

Derek: Just imagine if LIGO never worked! *gulp*

Alan: Robert A. Heinlein wrote a book about a society that prided itself in funding projects that wouldnt succeed for 100 years. Unfortunately, the society kept messing up, and the wild-idea projects had practical applications within a few years.

Derek: That is worth a try

Christie: Last year I wrote about this theory of creativity that says that following interesting ideas and seeing where they lead you results in bigger payoffs than working toward a concrete goal. Seems true of science too.

Alan: That to me is a big implication here. Our national funding agencies, like NSF, NIH, etc., need to put money into pure research even if they cannot see an immediate payoff.

Katie: Yes, thats hugely important. Its easier to think outside the box if you ignore the box entirely.

Alan: Actually, gravitational waves, among all other waves, can penetrate the box, any box.

Christie: Yeah, this looks like a brilliant example of the payoffs of basic research, which you can never predict in advance.

Derek: Im with you, but as devils advocate: If LIGO was just a continuous disaster, never producing results, wed be having a different conversation right now, for sure.

Alan: I dont think LIGO could have been a continuous disaster. We knew from theoretical calculation the likely sources of gravitational waves, the likely strengths, and we knew how sensitive the device had to be. We slowly but steadily worked towards that sensitivity.

Its not like when we searched for the decay of the proton, where we werent sure of the underlying theory.

Christie: I wonder though if it would be helpful to science if funders could embrace failure a little more. Sometimes its the best teacher.

Alan: Totally agreed. You have to risk failure to get results, certainly results like this one. There is a saying in Bridge, the card game: If you dont lose half your slam bids, you are not bidding them often enough.

Derek: Thats a good point, and Id say it speaks to the quality of the funding agencies: They seem to be able to recognize a plausible, even if difficult, idea. At least thats my impression. It sounds like maybe you think they could be more daring?

Christie: So, Alan, how could funders adopt an approach thats not afraid to fail?

Alan: Well, none of us are saying that funders should support failure. But we are saying that funders should take some chances on longer bets and not always be looking for quick payoffs. Funders should support very solid and dedicated scientists who they trust, like Thorne, Weiss and Drever.

Derek: Id add that sometimes, if its reasonable, you can try things where you expect one outcome, but another would open lots of new science. The ether is the classic example: They all expected it to be there, and when it wasnt, voila! Way more interesting stuff ...

Katie: Funders should also support new investigators and new ideas, though. Cant always be just the top established people. Theres a lot to be said for funding experiments based on expected value, right? High risk but high reward experiments are just as important as stuff thats almost certain to pay off but isnt revolutionary.

Christie: Katie, do you think this could inspire a new wave of physicists?

Katie: I definitely think young people will be inspired by this. Black holes and warped spacetime were the kinds of things that got me excited as a kid.

Alan: The astonishing thing is that the physical event was so clean. Two black holes spiraling into each other is far neater and more predictable than a black hole and a neutron star, for example.

Derek: Were there other, messier events that probably generated gravitational waves, but we just cant tell? What are the chances that the first was so perfect? And from a direction where the Louisiana detector could so clearly hear it first.

Alan: I believe that LIGO has been picking up other, smaller and messier events. Nothing is as clean as two black holes spiraling into each other. You dont have to know anything about the crust of a neutron star, etc.

Christie: So were running out of time. Shall we wrap up with a few final thoughts?

Alan: Its a great day for science, and the human civilization that has produced our science.

Derek: Agreed  this is an amazing achievement that is beautiful, interesting and will surely lead to things we cant imagine now.

Katie: Its the start of a whole new era  a new branch of astronomy! (Ive been saying that a lot over the past few days, but its not at all an exaggeration.)

Alan: We are back in the time of Galileo, but looking forward.

Christie: Thanks so much for your time, all. It was a delight to have you here.

Alan: Until the next black hole collision!",[]
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 21:17:42+00:00,The Pope Is Way More Popular Than Donald Trump,"['Leah Libresco', 'Nate Silver']","Donald Trump took a break from threatening to sue rival candidates on Thursday and appears to be trying to start a holy war with Pope Francis instead. Trump may not care about any resulting eternal judgment, but he might have reason to worry about worldly opinion: Pope Francis has a net +53 favorability rating among Americans, while Trump has a net -27 favorability rating.

True, Pope Francis is somewhat less popular with Republicans than among Americans overall. But hes still reasonably well-liked. In a CNN poll in September, 56 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of Pope Francis as compared to 21 percent with an unfavorable one. Francis had +20 net favorability rating even among self-described tea-party supporters.

For once, this is a fight that Trump didnt start. Reporters asked Pope Francis, during one of the informal press conferences held on the papal plane what he thought of Trumps position on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The pope said that he wasnt familiar with Trumps position, but added, I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.

The majority of conservative Catholics would probably agree with that assessment of Trumps faith. According to a survey conducted in January by the Pew Research Center, just under half (49 percent) of Catholics who are Republicans or lean toward the GOP said that Trump was not very or not at all religious. That was the highest level of skepticism expressed by any of the denominations Pew surveyed. (White mainline Protestants were most likely to give Trump the benefit of the doubt; 35 percent judged him to be not very or not at all religious.)

However, a sizable share of Catholics are open to seeing Trump in the White House, even if they dont expect to see him in a pew. In Pews survey, 30 percent of all Catholics who are registered to vote said they felt that Trump would be a good or great president. Thats pretty much on par with registered voters in general (31 percent). In other words, Catholics are swing voters. In 2012, Catholics gave 50 percent of their votes to Barack Obama and 48 percent to Mitt Romney, according to the national exit poll.

Trump doesnt need to worry as much about winning over Catholics in coming weeks. The next set of GOP primaries doesnt occur in heavily Catholic states. Super Tuesdays contests on March 1 will include Massachusetts, where Catholics made up 51 percent of Republican voters in 2008, but most of the upcoming states are in the South, where few Catholics reside.

STATE WINNER AMONG CATHOLICS (2008) CATHOLIC SHARE OF GOP ELECTORATE (2008) New Jersey McCain 57% Massachusetts Romney 51 New York McCain 46 Connecticut McCain 45 Wisconsin McCain 39 New Hampshire McCain/Romney tie 38 Vermont McCain 35 Maryland McCain 33 Louisiana McCain 32 Illinois McCain 31 Florida McCain 30 Michigan Romney 29 Delaware McCain 28 Ohio McCain 26 California McCain 25 Missouri McCain 20 Arizona McCain 20 Virginia McCain 19 Nevada Romney 18 Texas McCain 16 South Carolina McCain 13 Oklahoma ** 11 Georgia Romney 11 Mississippi ** 9 Tennessee McCain 6 Arkansas ** 6 Alabama ** 5 Utah ** 3 Where are the Republican Catholics? ** Sample size too small to reliably determine winner among Catholics Source: Edison/Mitofsky National Election Pool Exit Polls, 2008

But although the Catholic-heavy states fall later, they could prove important to the delegate math. Many of their delegates are awarded on a winner-take-most (as in New York, where 46 percent of the Republican electorate was Catholic in 2008) or winner-take-all (as in New Jersey, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) basis. So if Trump doubles down on his fight with the pope, he could wind up paying a price as he seeks to expand his coalition beyond his enthusiastic base  particularly given that he may already have a relatively low ceiling on his support. In 2008, another competitive primary (and one with more comprehensive exit polling than 2012), Catholics were an important part of John McCains coalition, and theyre a group that a candidate like Marco Rubio (who is Catholic) or John Kasich could come to rely upon this year.

Plus its just plain inaccurate to complain, as Trump did, that for a religious leader to question a persons faith is disgraceful. For someone whose titles include Vicar of Jesus Christ and Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, questioning and clarifying other peoples faith is pretty much the job description.",[]

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 20:26:15+00:00,Everyone Still Reads To Kill A Mockingbird,['Hayley Munguia'],"On Friday, the mayors office in Monroeville, Alabama, announced that Harper Lee, author of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird and its controversy-plagued 2015 sequel Go Set A Watchman, had died at age 89. A look at the numbers behind Lees greatest work bear out its prominent place in American culture.

In 2012, the Fordham Institute, an education policy think tank, surveyed 484 high school English teachers about which books they assigned. According to the groups study, Mockingbird was taught by more ninth- and 10th-grade teachers  35 percent of them  than any other book of fiction listed. It also tops most works in other categories, including poetry and plays. Mockingbird beats the most-taught works of Mark Twain, Shakespeare or John Steinbeck. The only reading material that topped it was Martin Luther King Jr.s I Have A Dream speech, which was taught by 38 percent of teachers in those grades.

The book is also widely taught on college campuses. According to the Open Syllabus Project, which tracks books that are listed on more than a million college syllabi nationwide, To Kill a Mockingbird was assigned 633 times, making it the 255th-most-assigned book in the database  an impressive rank, considering that the vast majority of the titles are either textbooks or predate the 20th century. (Of the top 10 books, only two  E.B. White and William Strunk Jr.s The Elements of Style and Neil Campbells textbook Biology  were published after 1850.)

In terms of determining where To Kill a Mockingbird stands among similar texts, the Open Syllabus Project also has data on which books are the most likely to be assigned together in college, which could be a somewhat more useful proxy for comparing books that contributed to American culture in the same way. To Kill a Mockingbird was most likely to be assigned along with J.D. Salingers The Catcher in the Rye, William Goldings Lord of the Flies, F. Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby and George Orwells Animal Farm.

To get a sense of how popular these books are beyond college classrooms, Goodreads is the place to go. Of the five books listed above, To Kill a Mockingbird has both the highest number of ratings and the highest average rating, 4.23 out of 5 stars.

But even though theres a pretty established consensus that its a great book (though there are dissenting opinions), Google search data shows that we probably cant separate it  or any of the books associated with it  from the classroom.

The seasonality of the search data hints at the link between the books popularity and their use in the classroom. Most searches for the five books take place around May every year, presumably when students are studying for finals or writing essays. Theres also a similar, albeit smaller, uptick around November or December every year  another indicator of cramming for midterms or finals.

The May 2013 spike in searches for The Great Gatsby is no doubt tied to the release of Baz Luhrmanns film adaptation. But even with that factored in, To Kill a Mockingbird still wins the search game over time; until 2012, Lees novel was the most-searched of the five, and on average since 2004, its still been searched about 10 percent more often than Fitzgeralds.

The data on Lees influence is clear, but it really just tells us what we already know: By grappling with racial injustice in American society  an issue that we still struggle with  Harper Lees work endures, and will continue to do so for many years to come.",[]
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 20:06:40+00:00,Talking To The Terriers At The Westminster Dog Show,['Jody Avirgan'],"Dog show people are very obsessive about record keeping, luckily for us.

Subscribe: iTunes | Download | RSS | Video

Accept, for a moment, that dog shows are like any other sporting event, and youll soon notice that they have their own legendary dynasty. That dynasty is the terrier. As FiveThirtyEights Oliver Roeder recently wrote, the terrier won 29 of the first 43 Best in Shows awarded at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the sports premier event.

On this weeks episode of our podcast Whats The Point, we visit the Westminster show and chat with Ollie about the terriers dominance, how data may change dog shows, and why other breeds are beginning to catch up. Plus, we meet a bunch of cute dogs.

To listen, stream or download the full episode above, or subscribe using your favorite podcast app. Below, a few highlights from Ollies piece, which you can read in full on FiveThirtyEight.

The fall of the terrier

The American Kennel Club, which is the governing body for dog shows and whose membership includes Westminster, tallies the most popular breeds in the country each year, going back to 1935. This data is based on purebred dog registrations with the club, which says it registers nearly 1 million dogs each year. (There are something like 80 million dogs owned in the U.S.) [In the mid-20th century,] many of the all-star terrier breeds began to decline. This fall from prominence has affected more than the multi-champion terrier breeds. The Dandie Dinmont, the Skye, the Kerry Blue, the Bedlington, the Welsh, the standard Manchester, the Australian and the Lakeland have all seen significant declines in popularity, as well. For some terrier breeds, the situation is existential. In 2011, a campaign was launched to save the Sealyham terrier  winner of four Westminster Best in Shows and once the dog of choice of King George V, Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor  from extinction. If we can save the rhino or tiger, we can surely save this useful and charming breed of dog, the British magazine Country Life wrote.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 18:31:45+00:00,The Same Four Operas Are Performed Over And Over,['Brian Wise'],"The Metropolitan Opera announced its 2016-17 schedule this week, and it still cant quit its old standbys. Just three days into its new season, which starts in September, the Met will have already returned to its most-performed work: Puccinis La Boheme. About a month after that, Verdis Aida will take the stage. Two-and-a-half months after that: Bizets Carmen. The three most-performed works in Metropolitan Opera history will all appear next season, as is so often the case.

Opera types call them the ABCs for the letters in their titles  and because theyre staples of opera repertories. When you add in the fourth-most-performed opera in Met history, Verdis La Traviata, which will also be staged next season, those four operas will account for nearly a quarter of all the Mets performances next season  even though 22 other operas are being mounted. That top tier of operas are a class unto themselves: Company archives show that a season rarely goes by without them. You can see that below in the chart, which compares those top-tier operas with others being performed next season.

Since its Met premiere in 1900, La Boheme has been staged in all but eight seasons, according to the Met archives. And the current Franco Zeffirelli production, unveiled in 1981, is the most-seen production of all operas in the companys history, according to John Pennino, an archivist at the Met. Some recent years have yielded as many as 25 performances in a season of 242.

As a close observer of the opera world, I wouldnt dare suggest that the top-tier operas dont deserve such frequent showings. Theres a reason theyre beloved: Aida evokes ancient Egypt through grand sets and choruses; La Boheme has unforgettable characters who embody the transience of life and art; Carmen wraps lushly exotic melodies around the story of a femme fatale; and La Traviata portrays an ill-fated love affair with both glamour and intimacy.

But for the Met, which is the countrys largest and most influential opera company, their unrivaled popularity can present a challenge: How can it expand its repertoire while being dependent on the top tiers popularity?

The top four works are reliable entry points for many newcomers  crucial at a time when the Met has been grappling with an aging subscriber base and a sluggish box office. Overplaying them, though, could take up slots that would otherwise go to lesser-known works. Thats a tension almost any premier artistic institution has to work through: how to stay solvent while trying to advance the art form. General manager Peter Gelb told The New York Times on Wednesday that the company is always trying to find ways to satisfy confirmed opera lovers, as well as excite new ones. Under Gelb, the Met has sought to replace aging productions with new, modernized stagings, and traditionalists have sometimes responded harshly. Six new productions are planned for 2016-17. (The Met declined to comment when we asked about the repertory balance.)

In September, the Met reported that houses were, in aggregate, 74 percent full during its 2014-15 season, compared with 76.9 percent the previous season. Over the past couple of years, the company has faced a multimillion-dollar shortfall that it has since closed; last season, it reported a $1 million surplus.

The Met hopes to see newcomers become the confirmed opera lovers of tomorrow, but creating a path from La Boheme to an arcane gem by Handel or a premiere by Nico Muhly is not a simple proposition. If theres a way forward, it involves a healthy opera ecosystem in which the old favorites, lesser-known operas and contemporary works co-exist and opera-goers are steered from one to the next.

Once youve seen Mimis death scene in La Boheme for the umpteenth time, its nice to know theres something else to see every now and then.",[]
fivethirtyeight,2014-11-21 17:46:32+00:00,Skeptical Football: Patriots vs. Cardinals And An Interactive History Of The NFL,['Benjamin Morris'],"The first 10 games of the NFL season are its exposition period  we get to know the characters and themes that we expect to see develop as the race to the playoffs unfolds. This year, like nearly every other in the past decade, the New England Patriots refusal to regress to the mean is a central storyline.

Remember back when the Patriots were 0-1 and faced a must-win in Week 2? Well, they won. Then in Week 4 they dropped to 2-2, and the end of an era was supposedly nigh. Except no. Pats will be Pats, and now theyve won their last six games en route to the best record in the AFC. That streak has included comfortable wins against the Cincinnati Bengals (who at one point projected to have the best record), the surprisingly strong Buffalo Bills, and Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. (The Patriots are also tied with the Green Bay Packers for a league-leading point differential). And according to my colleague Neil Paine, the Patriots are really a second-half team. I shudder to think.

But theres another storyline thats dominated the exposition period: The best record in the NFL belongs to the 9-1 Arizona Cardinals. While theyve beaten some decent teams like Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco, they dont have what the yakkers call a signature win. They have only the seventh-best SRS in football, second to the Packers in the NFC, and only a half-point ahead of the defending champion Seattle Seahawks (who have four losses).

Aside from being the class of their respective conferences so far this year, the two franchises have little in common. The Cardinals have now secured their second winning season in a row  and can count that as an accomplishment in light of their 90-year history of losing. Although the Patriots dominance of the regular season continues apace, they will likely be disappointed if they dont win their first Super Bowl in 10 years.

To illustrate just how divergent these two franchises have been, I created a chart to show the entire history of the NFL (or at least what we have stats for). This is the cumulative regular-season point differential since 1920, for all teams (with the Patriots and the Cardinals highlighted):

The current Patriots dynasty is lengthy and steep, and belongs in the same group as the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, the Cleveland Browns of the 50s and 60s, or the Chicago Bears of the 30s and 40s (especially when you factor in league parity).

That chart is fun, but it would be a lot more useful if we could make out all 81 NFL franchises individually. Well ...

Chart of the week

Thanks to the great work of designated Skeptical Football charts guru Reuben Fischer-Baum, you can do just that. Roll over a line to see the teams entire history, and move along the line to see exactly how many points it has scored compared to its opponents at a given point. You can also click on a team to keep its line highlighted, and then roll over another team for comparison. Irrelevant dates (where no regular-season games were played) are excluded from the timeline.

Here are a couple of things I found from the interactive that I thought were interesting:

Even more Aaron Rodgers

First, Aaron Rodgers  apparently unmoved by my ongoing criticism of his failure to throw more interceptions  is absolutely tearing it up this year (at least when his team is ahead, which is most of the time lately). Recently, he accomplished something pretty cool that I didnt know about:

On Sept. 25, 2011, Rodgers threw three touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 27-17. With that result, the Packers had scored 2,991 more points than their opponents all-time, ahead of the Bears 2,989  and the Packers havent looked back. As of last Sunday, Green Bay held the NFLs best historical margin of victory by 358 points.

Comment of the week

Last week Neil Paine and I wrote an article titled Randy Moss May Well Have Been The Greatest Receiver Of All Time  which focused on the insane With Or Without You stats that Moss put up in his career. In the discussion, we raised the possibility that if receivers can have as much of an impact as Randy Moss appeared to have, that may cast doubt on some previous knowledge  like how good of a quarterback Joe Montana was considering he had Jerry Rice running routes for so long.

A few different people in the comments and elsewhere raised the point that Joe Montana had already won two Super Bowls before Jerry Rice arrived in San Francisco:

Upon further consideration, Im inclined to agree that its fairly unlikely that Rice was the driving force behind the 49ers success. But Im not so sure Montana was either.

Winning in the NFL can happen for a lot of different reasons  a star quarterback (think Peyton Manning), a successful new offensive or defensive strategy (think West Coast offense, zone blitz, or, more recently, the Wildcat), or a standout player who creates mismatches that other teams struggle with (think Randy Moss). But the effects of various win-generating phenomena can come in a lot of shapes and sizes.

For example, lets compare the 49ers to the St. Louis Rams. Pay particular attention to the Greatest Show on Turf era from 1999 into the early 2000s:

The Greatest Show on Turf Rams had a few different things going for them, but their success was sudden, rocky, and lasted only a few years. They broke the game for a while in the sense that they were something the rest of the NFL didnt know how to deal with. But despite having a lasting effect on how football is played, their dominance was fragile.

On the other hand, from the early 80s to the late 90s, the 49ers outscored their opponents by around 2,500 points  by far the most dominant stretch in the Super Bowl era. And they did it with a practically straight line, meaning they were better than their opposition by a nearly constant amount.

If the 49ers owed a significant part of their success to any one player (or phenomenon of any kind), wed likely see more variety in the teams arc as that players performance fluctuated, or as he was injured, or left. But the consistency of the 49ers ascension suggests they were more of an organization-driven phenomenon. At the very least, it implies that they were the sum of many different quality parts.

Playing around with the interactive, Im fascinated by how different phenomena manifest. For example: How do the impacts of offensive and defensive innovation compare? What are the effects of a quarterback versus those of a coach? There are a lot of possibilities, so let us know what you uncover in the comments or on Twitter.

Week 11 kicking awards

I keep thinking (and my editor keeps hoping) this will be the week I wont bother talking about kickers, but then Las Vegas Locomotives alumnus Graham Gano has to go and attempt a 63-yard field goal with one second left in a thriller between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately for the Panthers, it was blocked.

My kicking model suggests that a kicker in 2014 should typically be able to make a 63-yard field goal around 40 percent of the time  but this may be skewed by the fact that such long kicks are so rarely attempted. Still, Ganos 63-yarder wasnt what earned him the kicker loss and Week 11s Least Valuable Kicker award. What did him in was his previous miss, a 46-yarder, which a 2014 NFL kicker should typically make about 77 percent of the time.

My algorithm picked the Falcons Matt Bryant as the MVK over the St. Louis Rams Greg Zeurlein (who had an excellent week, going 5/5 with two 50+ yarders in the Rams huge upset of the Broncos), on account of Bryant making four field goals in a game his team only won by two (though none was over 44 yards).

But the biggest news of the week is that with Nick Novak missing a kick for the San Diego Chargers, were down to just two perfect kickers, and theyre both veterans: the Indianapolis Colts Adam Vinatieri and the New York Giants Josh Brown.

Gunslinger of the week

There were 26 interceptions thrown in Week 11, and seven of them were thrown by the Manning brothers. Eli Manning had five in the Giants narrow loss against the 49ers  four of which were thrown with his team trailing  enough to win him our Gunslinger of the Week award.

Throwing a practically embarrassing number of interceptions now and then is something great quarterbacks do. QBs, dont be ashamed of looking bad when trying to win! A loss is a loss, whether you throw zero interceptions or six. My maxim is: If a quarterback loses a game without throwing a few interceptions, he probably didnt try hard enough.

In general, Eli Manning is a bit of an unknown. He puts up fairly big totals for a mediocre team, but often gets criticized for his high interception rate. Yet his win curve looks mostly like his big brothers, only flatter, and its plausible that his shame-free style was partially responsible for the Giants shocking wins in two Super Bowls. Elis gambling wouldnt necessarily make the Giants favorites against stronger competition, but it might have given them a better chance against a team like the 2007 Patriots than a better team with a quarterback who took fewer risks.

Just for fun, I looked at the Pro Football Reference list of quarterbacks with the most four-plus-interception games. The top four are George Blanda, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler and Terry Bradshaw (all of whom won championships, and three of whom are in the Hall of Fame). Of the top 50 such QBs, 15 have won championships (and account for 20 Super Bowls), including both brothers Manning.

Rookie QB watch

The biggest news in rookie QB-land was in Tennessee, where sixth-round-pick Zach Mettenberger had a fairly strong game against the Pittsburgh Steelers (263 yards and two touchdowns). Hes now guaranteed to reach the magical four-start line when rookie QBs are more likely to have successful careers. Im not quite ready to move him up in the rankings just yet, but every pass he completes is one more than Johnny Manziel has completed all year. As of now, Id order the rookies estimated career prospects like so:

The Jacksonville Jaguars Blake Bortles had a bye week. The Oakland Raiders Derek Carr, despite finally winning a game Thursday night (in dramatic fashion) has had a pretty weak couple of weeks, with just 172 and 174 yards in Weeks 11 and 12, despite a combined 69 pass attempts. The Minnesota Vikings Teddy Bridgewaters two game winning streak came to an end in Chicago. Mettenberger. The Patriots Jimmy Garropolo. Manziel once again got all dressed up with no ball to throw.

Not really in the game yet but worth keeping an eye on: Logan Thomas is now second on the depth chart in Arizona. So far this year he has a 108.9 NFL Passer Rating, but hes gotten it the hard way: He has only one completion in eight attempts (10 if you count sacks), but it went for 81 yards and a touchdown.

Reader response

In Week 9s column, I introduced my experimental win curves for quarterbacks, which depict how much each QB typically wins relative to various expectations, and I included a number of examples.

I covered most popular quarterbacks, with a couple of notable exceptions. One request I got an awful lot:

@skepticalsports As a Bears fan, I'd love to see the ""Win Curve"" for Jay Cutler that you wrote about in your latest @FiveThirtyEight column  John D. Kos (@johndkos) November 7, 2014

I would have included Cutler initially, but I had a problem with his curve: It was coming out as a perfectly straight line, virtually indistinguishable from the y=x guide (a highly unlikely outcome). I thought this might have been a data problem, but it turns out Cutlers results really were just too vanilla for the method I was using to pick up the variation. So I tried an alternate method that is more sensitive to small variation. The alternate method turned out to be less sensitive to large variation as well, so I was able to plot a couple more notable quarterbacks as well as Cutler:

Russell Wilson  like his comrade Andrew Luck  has a very impressive curve so far in his career, albeit over a sample still probably too small for this analysis. (He also gets very good support from a strong team around him.)

Cutlers curve is still remarkably unremarkable, but at least it shows up. He appears to do slightly above average regardless of the circumstances. As a special treat for Bears fans who had to wait two weeks  and because I wanted to see what was going into this virtually straight line  Ive broken down Cutlers curve by quarter, and compared each to the same breakdown for Peyton Manning (our standard-bearer for such things):

Being very far ahead or behind in the first quarter is rare, so you should take the tails of that quadrant with a grain of salt. In the second and fourth quarters, Cutler seems to outperform average in a pretty uniform way, and in the third-quarter he has a bit of a reverse-Matthew Stafford thing going on.

Most empirically significant game of this week

The Cardinals matchup against the defending champion Seahawks is a pretty big test for the team with the leagues best record.

But on top of that, the Cardinals have a lot of important parts coming and going, which is always empirically significant: Their top QB (Carson Palmer) is out. Last week, Cardinals backup Drew Stanton held off the Detroit Lions Stafford at the end of the game, but the Cardinals still struggled. Leading for most of the game, they rushed 26 times, but gained only 46 yards. And their top receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, is injured but may play anyway. As demonstrated in the article on Moss, the value of top-notch WRs can affect our broader understanding of the game.

And then there are the Seahawks  who were young powerhouses last year, but are possibly already in decline  and Russell Wilson, who last year averaged 33.7 yards rushing per game. Thats by far the most of any QB in a year his team won the Super Bowl  and hes averaging 57.1 per game this year. What running quarterbacks mean for the game is a fascinating open question. A lot of newer, fancier QB-rating systems are giving QBs a lot of credit for their scrambling (often much more than if you treated those plays the same as completed pass attempts). But while those individual plays can be valuable, there havent been a lot of dynamic offenses built around running QBs, and its still unclear whether this is just a bonus skill or whether it will be a necessity in the future NFL.

Its perhaps even more valuable to see Wilson in action with the Seahawks struggling a bit (it can also be harder to isolate an individual players contributions when a team is firing on all cylinders). Hell be tested against a Cardinals defense that grades out as one of the best in the NFL this year  a perfect opportunity to see what both are made of.

Reminder: If you tweet questions to me @skepticalsports, there is a non-zero chance that Ill answer them here.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-19 17:14:43+00:00,Whats At Stake In The South Carolina Republican Primary,['Nate Silver'],"This article includes polls through noon Friday; check out our primary forecast page for updates.

Weve been inundated with polls: South Carolina polls, Nevada polls, national polls, general election polls. In fact, there are so many polls that you can tell yourself pretty much any story you like about the Republican presidential primary. Is Ted Cruz surging? Theres a poll for that. Is Cruz stalling out? Theres a poll for that too. Have you heard about the poll showing a Ben Carson comeback? OK, I made that one up. But earlier this week, you could find a poll with John Kasich in second place in South Carolina, even though he was polling at about 2 percent there earlier this month.

If this were a general election, wed just say take the average and be done with it. Thats still pretty good advice. The average lets us say, with a high degree of confidence, that Donald Trump is ahead in South Carolina. (That parts easy: Trump has led in all but one poll there since July.) With a slightly lesser but still high degree of confidence we can say that Marco Rubio has gained ground: He was at 13.1 percent in our South Carolina polling average before Iowa and is at 16.8 percent now. We can also say that Trump has probably lost a couple of percentage points, but probably not more. We can say that Jeb Bushs numbers are flatter than the places listed here.

But unlike in the general election, where the polling average usually gives you a fairly precise estimate of where the race will end up, the South Carolina polls could still wind up being way off. We warned you about this before Iowa, where the polls mispredicted the order of finish, and likewise before New Hampshire, where they were closer to the mark (although hardly perfect). Were probably going to have to keep warning you until the Republican race settles down to only two or three major candidates  multiway races are historically associated with much larger polling errors.

So instead of pretending we know exactly how things will turn out, lets look at the most likely range of outcomes for each candidate as defined by our polls-plus forecast and consider how those outcomes might affect the race going forward.

Donald Trump

90th percentile forecast: 42 percent

10th percentile forecast: 22 percent

Trump is a heavy favorite in South Carolina. He has a 78 percent chance of winning the state according to polls-plus and an 83 percent chance by our simpler polls-only model  although hes not quite completely safe. In fact, its not that hard to imagine the scenario in which Trump loses: Suppose that this weeks NBC/Marist poll had the race pegged correctly, with Cruz within striking distance, and that Trump fares poorly among late-deciders, as was true in Iowa. That NBC/Marist poll sure looks a lot like the pre-Iowa polling average, doesnt it? Additionally, maybe Trumps comments about the pope will hurt him?

Fortunately for Trump, the NBC/Marist poll is an outlier relative to the prevailing trend. More likely, Trump will win South Carolina, but the share of the vote he secures while doing so is important. Why did Trump get 35 percent of the vote in New Hampshire but only 24 percent in Iowa? Was it because Iowa is a caucus and New Hampshire a primary? Is it that New Hampshire is in the Northeast and Iowa is in the Midwest? (The Northeast and the South seem to be stronger regions for Trump than the Midwest or the West.) Well get more data about that in South Carolina. Perhaps the single most important question in the Republican race is how high Trumps ceiling is and whether he can eventually get to 50+ percent of the GOP electorate. If Trump wins South Carolina with, say, 41 percent of the vote, hell be much closer to that majority than if he limps through to a victory with 26 percent instead.

Ted Cruz

90th percentile forecast: 28 percent

10th percentile forecast: 12 percent

It can be a dangerous game to predict in which direction the polls might be off. But for Cruz, Id probably take the over on 19 percent, his standing in our current polling average. The reason is simply that South Carolinas evangelical-heavy demographics are not that different from Iowas, where Cruz won with 28 percent of the vote. Even if you knock off a few points for Cruzs ground game being less helpful to him in a primary than a caucus, it shouldnt be a stretch for him to wind up in the low 20s.

And yet, maybe some things have changed since Iowa. Cruzs favorability ratings, which until recently were among the best in the GOP field, have begun to fray as hes come under attack more often both from other candidates and from Republican Party elites. Cruzs colleagues dont like the guy  he has no endorsements yet from his fellow senators  and maybe he isnt wearing well with Republican voters either.

I also believe that Cruz doesnt have much of a shot at the nomination unless he finishes toward the higher end of his range. Cruz is at a delegate-math disadvantage in the primaries: Most of the states where he should be strong divide their delegates fairly proportionately, whereas the coastal and northerly states that vote later are winner-take-all or winner-take-most. If Cruz cant get out to a pretty big delegate lead after Super Tuesday, its going to be hard for him to catch up later. And if he cant win South Carolina or at least come pretty close, its hard to see him doing all that well in other Southern states on Super Tuesday.

Marco Rubio

90th percentile forecast: 27 percent

10th percentile forecast: 12 percent

Rubio is nearly tied with Cruz for second place in the polls-plus forecast, but thats because polls-plus gives Rubio some credit for his growing lead in endorsements  including the backing of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. In the polls-only forecast, by contrast, Cruz is a couple of percentage points ahead of Rubio.

Im sweating the details on this one because the national media seems to have a hyperbolic reaction to all things Rubio, alternatively declaring him to be on the verge of a breakout or predicting his imminent demise, as they did after New Hampshire. Rubio, who is acceptable to many Republicans but impassions few of them, may be more susceptible to actual or perceived momentum than a love-him-or-hate-him candidate like Trump.

Rubios playing a long game, however. Even under the best of circumstances, hes likely to lose most of the Super Tuesday states to Trump or Cruz. Even under the worst of circumstances, Republicans may come back around to Rubio by process of elimination. That endorsers such as Haley threw their support to Rubio even after his New Hampshire debacle is partly a reflection of Rubios resilience  he was reasonably good in last weeks debate, and his polls have held up pretty well  but also an indictment of Bush, Kasich and the other alternatives.

So Ill be looking to two benchmarks for Rubio. One is whether he approaches 20 percent of the vote; as The New York Times Nate Cohn points out, thats a key threshold for Rubio because many Super Tuesday states use 20 percent as a minimum threshold for awarding delegates. The other, more obvious one is how Rubio fares relative to Bush. Lets talk about Jeb!

Jeb Bush

90th percentile forecast: 19 percent

10th percentile forecast: 6 percent

I thought Bush was effective in the last couple of debates. His ground game was surprisingly impressive when we visited Iowa. Bush and his super PAC are still dropping more money than any other candidate: In South Carolina, the Right to Rise PAC backing Bush had spent roughly $13 million on ads through Feb. 14 according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, almost as much as all other Republican candidates and super PACs combined (about $17 million).

So the fact that Bush performed so poorly in Iowa and New Hampshire (dont give me any spin about his having beaten expectations)  and that his numbers have been so flat in South Carolina despite the spending, the debates and the Bush family jamboree  would seem to suggest that Republican voters simply arent buying what hes selling.

Frankly, this has seemed apparent to us for a long time. Nonetheless, Ill keep an open mind about Bush until we get this last bit of evidence, which is how he fares among South Carolina voters. The thing about the primaries is that they can string candidates along. If Bush can spin some kind of narrative about South Carolina to his donors, welp, its only three more days until Nevada and then just seven more days until Super Tuesday and then just another week until Michigan and then just a week more until Florida votes on March 15. Even if Bush is a zombie candidate, his presence in the race makes it hard for the field to consolidate.

Theres also an outside chance that Bush could do legitimately well in South Carolina instead of just muddling through. Some state polls have had Bush in the mid-teens, and our polls-plus model gives him a 27 percent chance of finishing in the top three and even an outside chance of a second-place finish. Personally, I dont see a Bush second place happening. But one advantage of a statistical model is that it can force you to consider possibilities you might otherwise be too dismissive of.

CANDIDATE 1ST 2ND 3RD 4TH 5TH 6TH Donald Trump 78% 15% 5% 1% <1% <1% Ted Cruz 11 38 30 13 5 3 Marco Rubio 10 35 33 15 6 2 Jeb Bush 1 8 18 32 24 17 John Kasich <1 3 11 24 34 27 Ben Carson <1 1 5 14 30 50 Chance of finishing in each position, S.C. GOP primary Percentages displayed are from FiveThirtyEights polls-plus forecast

John Kasich

90th percentile forecast: 16 percent

10th percentile forecast: 5 percent

Kasich has gotten a pretty sizable post-New Hampshire bounce. Hes gained about 6 percentage points in South Carolina polls since New Hampshire, according to our polling average, and also several points in national polls. The problem is that Kasich was starting out at about 2 percent in both cases, so even a fairly large bounce doesnt really put him on the radar. Kasich doesnt have a lot on the line in South Carolina  in fact, hell abandon the state as votes roll in Saturday to campaign in the Republican stronghold of Massachusetts  but his best scenario is that he beats Bush while Rubio also fares poorly.

Ben Carson

90th percentile forecast: 13 percent

10th percentile forecast: 3 percent

Speaking of zombie campaigns, Ben Carson is still running for president! And his presence matters a little more than you might think. A fraction of Carsons roughly 7 percent of the vote could be the difference between Cruz winning states on Super Tuesday and losing them to Trump, or between Rubio hitting delegate thresholds and failing to do so. If youre the sort of weirdo who loves these details, youre in luck: Well be live-blogging South Carolina and the Nevada Democratic caucuses all day Saturday, and we hope youll join us.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-18 23:31:46+00:00,China Is Splurging On Big-Name Soccer Talent,['Andrew Flowers'],"In the past few weeks, the Chinese Football Association Super League  the countrys premier professional soccer league  has been on a shopping spree. By the close of the January transfer window, the Chinese Super League had outspent Englands Premier League in the transfer market; the CSL made five of the six largest transfer signings in the 2015-16 window.

The biggest splash came when the Jiangsu Suning shelled out $55 million to acquire Alex Teixeira, a star Brazilian midfielder playing in Ukraine, who was hotly pursued by Liverpool. Teixeiras signing gives the CSL the 70th most valuable player in the world.

By attracting big-name talent, CSL clubs are signaling the rise of Chinese soccer power  at least financially. (The value of the signings to club owners likely has as much to do with marketability of the players for product endorsement purposes as it does with improving the team.) This power has grown in lockstep with the leagues attendance and revenue. Since the league was founded in 2004, total CSL attendance has surged from 1.4 million to more than 5 million in 2015; per-game attendance has more than doubled as the league has grown from 12 to 16 teams.

As Chinese soccer has grown domestically, the league has begun to throw around its financial weight in the international transfer market, thus boosting the total market value of CSL players. The leagues total value, according to Transfermarkt estimates of its players transfer market values (as opposed to aggregate transfer buys) has risen to about $380 million. Teixeiras transfer fee alone accounts for 15 percent of that. Thats humongous. Gareth Bales record-breaking (unless you ask Ronaldo) transfer fee to Real Madrid in 2013 came in north of $100 million, yet represented a mere 3 percent of the more than $3.4 billion estimated market value of La Ligas players in 2013.

Although the CSL is making international news with a few big-ticket signings, as a whole, the league is still small. The leagues total estimated market value is still half as big as even Portugals national league, and it pales in comparison to Englands Premier League, which is valued at $4.7 billion. In fact, the total market value of all 16 CSL teams is still less than that of just Liverpool. Thus, a transfer fee comparable to the one between the CSL and Teixeira would be about $700 million (!).

(As CSL teams make it rain, its worth noting that this cash isnt being evenly distributed. Foreign players make far more than Chinese players. CSL teams must abide by a strict cap of no more than four overseas players, plus one from another country in the Asian Football Confederation. And according to 2012 data, these foreign players pulled in earnings more than five times larger than those of their Chinese teammates. The disparity has probably only grown as the CSL hunts for pricier international stars.)

In some ways, the CSL has taken Major League Soccers model and supercharged it. MLS has tried  with debatable success  to gin up fan interest by splurging on a few big-name, often well-aged, international players. David Beckham joining the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007 on a (comically inaccurate) $250 million deal comes to mind. By the 2008 season, the entire MLS had an estimated market value of about $157 million; with more than $10 million of that being Beckham. Today, that number has crept up to $314 million  exponential growth, but well behind the pace being set in China. So the CSL is following the MLS script, to a degree, only with players in their primes instead of broken-down warhorses like Frank Lampard.

Some macroeconomic context helps, too. Although there are signs that Chinas economy is slowing, and its stock market has been a disaster over the past year, the appetite of Chinese sports fans doesnt seem to be lagging. The slowdown within the Chinese economy seems to be focused on real estate, state-owned enterprises and the stock market. Although growing indebtedness is an issue, Chinese consumers are better positioned than other parts of the Chinese economy. So expect demand for  and spending from  Chinese Super League teams to keep growing. China has a very long way to go before its a top player in international club soccer, but if consumer interest grows at the pace its set, the CSL might just continue to draw stars anyway.

CORRECTION (Feb. 19, 2 p.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the basis for determining the monetary valuation of players in soccer teams and leagues. That valuation is measured by a Transfermarkt calculation of overall player market values, not just salaries. Transfermarkt makes the calculation based on the estimated value of the player in the transfer market. References in the article to how much teams and leagues have spent on salaries have been changed to the market values of their players.",[]

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-22 16:55:40+00:00,Trumps South Carolina Win Shows Evangelicals Arent Necessarily Voting On Their Faith,['Farai Chideya'],"CHARLESTON, S.C.  I firmly believe the American people must entrust this office to someone who understands that whoever holds it is the servant, not the master  someone who will commit to that service with honor and decency.

Jeb Bush, the abundantly funded establishment candidate, used that line to exit the presidential race after coming in fourth in Saturdays South Carolina GOP primary. Bushs language was political, but it also evoked the Christian faith. Of the many Bible verses about having a servant mentality, Mark 9:35, for example, describes Jesus saying to his disciples, Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all. The concept of servant leadership is widely cited in religious contexts, but also the secular ones of politics and corporate governance.

That kind of language should have served Bush well in appealing to South Carolinas Republican electorate  more than two-thirds of whom identify as white evangelical Christians. But by Saturday evening it was too late; South Carolina had voted and Bush had managed to win only 7 percent of evangelicals. Instead, a plurality  34 percent  went for Donald Trump, about the same share as the states GOP primary voters overall.

According to the Edison Research/National Election Pool, evangelicals even chose Trump over contenders like Marco Rubio (21 percent) and Ted Cruz (26 percent) who frequently cite their Christian backgrounds as a guidepost. Cruz, who won the Iowa Caucuses and outperformed polls largely based on evangelical support, has a national prayer team. Trump couldnt or wouldnt name his favorite verse of the Bible and has made gaffes including misnaming one of its books.

Trumps win among evangelicals was a bit of a surprise to the media  the cable networks hammered away at the issue, and on Sundays Meet the Press, Chuck Todd peppered Cruz with questions about why he lost the group that had supported him in Iowa. But the South Carolina results show evangelicals are a diverse group with sometimes differing priorities. Trump did well among less-conservative evangelicals but not among those who want a candidate who shares their values. And after all, two-thirds of South Carolina evangelicals voted for one of the other candidates instead.

Evangelical Christians are a quarter of the U.S. electorate. In South Carolinas exit polls, people who described themselves as born-again Christians (who may not always be or call themselves evangelicals) made up 72 percent of Republican primary voters, a record turnout for this group. Evangelical support for Trump has risen from 21 percent in Iowa to 28 percent in New Hampshire and now 34 percent in South Carolina. Nonetheless, by the luck of the draw, after spending hours at several polling places in the greater Charleston area, I ended up speaking with Trump voters, evangelical voters and non-evangelical Christian voters, but I found no evangelical Trump voters.

At a polling place in Mount Pleasant, a Charleston suburb, I spoke with Allan Woodbury, a 53-year-old small business owner who didnt cite religion as a factor in his decision to vote for Trump. He made his choice because, he said, I wanted the economy to get back on track. He said that come November he would back whichever GOP candidate is the nominee. But right now, Im voting for who I want to win. Others were less amenable  nearly half of Trump voters statewide said they would vote only for him. Two other voters I met  one in Mount Pleasant for John Kasich and one in North Charleston for Bush  said they would not vote for any other GOP candidates in the general election if their primary pick lost the nomination or dropped out.

Later on Saturday I visited the elegant home of Kim and Chris Nickels, who belong to Seacoast, a major evangelical church headquartered in Mount Pleasant with campuses throughout the state. Chris described their community as one of the major Republican hubs of the Charleston area, which overall voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Chris and Kim invited me to Seacoasts Saturday evening services, which started not long before the polls closed. Seacoast looks more like a college campus than a traditional church, with sports facilities, a bookstore, a coffee shop, and people in tidy casual wear, not high dress. At the packed services, minister Greg Surratt noted that a church he visited during the 70s had a dress code that forbade his then-au-courant bell-bottoms. Even earlier in the service, while noting the states political importance, he also made a point of saying the church was formally nonpartisan.

The Nickelses said no one they knew from church supported Trump. Chris, a lawyer, voted for Rubio. He said both Cruz and Rubio passed his smell test of fitting with his religious values and being a constitutional conservative, but Rubio could appeal more to younger voters. Kim, a nurse, picked Cruz, not just based on his strong faith and his political positions but because she believed he was best-positioned against Trump in South Carolina. (Rubio actually nudged Cruz out for second place.)

The Nickelses think part of the confusion of the race has been the wide field. The evangelical vote has been split among all the candidates, including Ben Carson, who once led the pack nationwide, and for whom their youngest daughter briefly worked on his book tour. (The Nickelses decided his candidacy wasnt progressing, and others seemed to agree; Carson got just 7 percent of the evangelical vote in South Carolina.)

2016 is demonstrating a lot of folks are upset with the status quo, Chris said. And I dont think its the status quo of Democrats or Republicans, just the status quo of politicians from either side of the aisle. And people are participating who have not participated before. New voters are picking Bernie Sanders and Trump, the latter of whom he described as not someone who I care for politically.

South Carolina allows all registered voters to participate in one primary  GOP or Dem  regardless of registration. Seeing people switch and move around has been so interesting to me, Kim said. She even persuaded a likely Democratic voter to vote in the GOP primary for Cruz in order to diminish the impact of Trump and stop a certain crazy train, she said. But I also like Marco Rubio and I would be proud to vote for him.

After Trumps win, conservative media mogul Glenn Beck asked listeners and viewers to join him in fasting on behalf of Cruz in advance of the Nevada GOP caucus this week. The mix of residents religious affiliation in Nevada is different from South Carolina, with white evangelical Protestants making up 10 percent of the Nevada population; white mainline Protestants 13 percent; Catholics of all races and ethnicities 23 percent; and Mormons 6 percent. If the country is lost, it will be lost because of the Christians not supporting Cruz, he said. (Beck himself is Mormon.) But his views of the leading GOP candidate are not universal among religious conservatives. Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr., whose televangelist father founded the Christian school, endorsed Trump late last month.

Chris said it was hard to understand why evangelicals would vote for Trump, likening the role of voters to that of jurors in a trial. You assess credibility ... and I think overall the assessment among evangelicals among Donald Trump is that he lacks some  not total  credibility. And I think thats very easy to trace in positions and statements and positions hes taken in Iowa when he needed to appeal to evangelicals. We pick up clues when he cites a certain book of the Bible. Chris also said Trumps crude or divisive language describing certain groups, especially women ... does not compute ... If you say you are an evangelical voter, how could you consider Donald Trump, given that there are five, six different choices out there?

After Bushs exit there are only five. And after Tuesday, when Nevada residents, who had their Democratic caucuses this past weekend, will hold their contest for Republican voters, there may be fewer. Trump is polling near 40 percent in Nevada by our polling average (though polls are sparse) while Rubio and Cruz are hovering around 20 percent. As the race narrows, the question is whether supporters of former candidates will head for Trump or the competition. (And if the competition, then who?)

A Jan. 30 Gallup poll of people of all political persuasions shows that Trump has a higher unfavorable rating than any eventual nominee from either party since at least 1992. But his support remains strong among Republicans, and thats what counts during primary and caucus season. In other words, one Americans  or evangelical Christians  crazy train could be anothers ticket to ride to what they hope is a better future.","['evangelical', 'faith', 'necessarily', 'trump', 'evangelicals', 'voters', 'win', 'rubio', 'gop', 'carolina', 'cruz', 'trumps', 'vote', 'voting', 'shows', 'south', 'arent']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-22 20:48:12+00:00,Anthony Daviss 59/20 Game Was A Throwback To The 1960s,['Neil Paine'],"Games like the one Anthony Davis had Sunday night dont come along very often  at least not in the modern NBA.

With 59 points in the New Orleans Pelicans 111-106 win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis set new scoring highs for both his own career and the 2015-16 NBA season. He also pulled down a whopping 20 rebounds. Basketball-Reference.com doesnt have complete game-by-game rebounding records from before the 1983-84 season (more on that later), but since then, there have only been two other 50/20 games: a 2000 contest in which Shaquille ONeal scored 61 points and grabbed 23 boards against the Clippers and a 2001 tilt during which Chris Webber dropped 51 and 26 on the Pacers.

Daviss eye-popping numbers on Sunday came through incredible efficiency. His true shooting percentage in the game was 76.8, far above the leagues season-long average of 53.9. (By comparison, Webbers true shooting percentage was only 51.4 in his big game, and Shaqs was 68.3  outstanding, but below Daviss mark.) On the other hand, Daviss Pelicans also played a fast pace  100.2 possessions  compared with other big scoring/rebounding games from the recent past. So where does Davis rank if we account for both these factors?

To answer that, I grabbed game-level data from Basketball-Reference.com starting in 1983-84, and adjusted each players scoring and rebounding totals for the pace of the game, setting them all to a pace of exactly 100 team possessions per 48 minutes. I also adjusted for a players efficiency, giving his scoring tally an extra bump if he was more efficient than the league average. This is to account for games like Webbers that have impressive raw stats but required a large number of attempts. Finally, I took the geometric mean  a special average used when combining two numbers from different scales  of the players adjusted point and rebound totals, arriving at this list of the best scoring/rebounding games of the past 33 seasons:

After crunching the numbers, Daviss game slips to No. 6, behind not only ONeals and Webbers but also games from Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and even Michael Jordan. (We dont tend to think of Jordan as a big rebounder, but he snagged 18 boards in his 69-point game against Cleveland in 1990.) Davis gets extra credit  about 7 points worth  for his efficiency but loses ground in the pace adjustment. A faster pace means more chances to score and snag rebounds, and Daviss game had about 7 percent more possessions than the average game above him on the list.

Of course, quibbling about where Daviss game ranks among the biggest scoring/rebounding performances in recent memory misses the bigger picture that games like Daviss (adjusted or no) are much more uncommon now than they were in the past. According to ESPNs Stats and Info crew, there were 36 games in NBA history (before Daviss on Sunday) featuring a player with a 59/20 stat line: the aforementioned Shaq game ... and 35 games from Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain, all before the mid-1970s. Chamberlain himself accounted for 33 of those games  17 of which came during his legendary 1961-62 season alone.

The simple truth is that outrageous single-game stat totals were a lot easier to come by in that era. The average pace factor for teams in 2015-16 is about 96 possessions per 48 minutes; the average in 1961-62, as best we can estimate it, was 126. In other words, compared with the modern game, that seasons players had over 31 percent more chances to score points and grab rebounds  59/20, for instance, becomes a mere 45/15 after adjusting away those extra possessions  and theres a good argument that rebounding numbers were inflated even further by the eras abysmally low field goal percentages (resulting in more missed shots to rebound). Theres a reason that Kevin Love in 2011 became the first player to average 20 points and 15 rebounds since 1983 and that 92 percent of the player-seasons meeting those criteria took place before 1976s NBA-ABA merger. The game was radically different back then, both on the court and in the stat sheets.

Thats why we should appreciate games like Daviss even more when they come along in todays NBA. Fifty-point, 20-rebound games have always represented special individual performances, but theyve become exponentially rarer these days, especially given recent changes to how the game is played. (Hello, Warriors!) So it might be a long time before you see another statistical game quite like the one Davis produced Sunday.","['24', 'daviss', '22', '44', '51', '26', '1960s', 'anthony', 'pace', 'game', '5920', 'throwback', 'games', 'average']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 16:00:23+00:00,Obama Will Have A Tough Time Rallying Support To Replace Scalia,['Anne Pluta'],"With the unexpected death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a new political battle looms for President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate, which convened for the first time since Scalias death this week. Both sides have already exchanged barbs about the possibility of appointing a replacement in an election year. With Republican senators pledging publicly to block Obamas appointment, the president is likely to wage a battle for public opinion, hoping to rile the public up enough to pressure Republicans to vote on a nominee.

So what power does a president have to shape public opinion? Not a lot.

Samuel Kernell, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, coined the phrase going public in the 1980s to describe the process by which presidents take the legislative bargaining process outside of Washington and attempt to curry public opinion in an effort to pressure Congressional representatives to do the presidents bidding. Kernell viewed this as a negative development that precluded democratic deliberation and was the result of technological change and a weakening of the party system.

Though going public seemed to be an effective strategy, its efficacy wasnt explicitly tested until 2003, when Texas A&M political scientist George Edwards III found presidents have little ability to meaningfully change public opinion through outward appeals. Edwards pointed specifically to Ronald Reagans efforts on Nicaragua, Bill Clintons push on health care and George W. Bushs efforts on tax cuts, education and the Iraq War.

APPROVAL RATING PRESIDENT ISSUE DATES NO. OF REMARKS STARTING ENDING Clinton Health care March 93  June 94 445 71% 43% G. W. Bush Tax cuts Feb. 01  May 01 27 56 56 G. W. Bush War in Iraq Sept. 02  March 03* 140 58 59 Obama Health care Feb. 09  Feb. 10 332 46 49 When presidents try to rally public support *As soon as hostilities began, support rose to almost 70 percent. Source: Gallup, Health Affairs

In addition to the examples Edwards provided, more recent scholarship  on Obamas health care push and Bushs attempt to reform Social Security  confirms it is difficult for presidents to effectively change peoples minds.

Even though scholars generally agree the president cant directly do much to move public opinion, its possible to increase media coverage and the perceived importance of an issue. Two political scientists, North Texass Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha and Clemsons Jeffrey S. Peake, argue that in going public a president is really looking to raise the profile of an issue rather than necessarily change public opinion.

Would raising awareness help Obama get a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate? Its hard to say, but it would be more likely to work if the public already favored Obamas position, and thats not clear. As The Washington Post reports, at least four national polls have been conducted on whether Obama should appoint Scalias successor. Two polls found the public evenly split, 47-46 and 43-42, in Obamas favor. The other two polls found even larger shares supporting a 2016 appointment (54 percent and 62 percent), but, as The Post notes, those polls included wording that specifically laid out the underlying logic of both sides of the argument.

Perhaps those two more decisive polls are a truer reflection of where the public will stand in a few months, once both sides have been arguing their case awhile. In that scenario, raising awareness of the standoff might help Obama put pressure on the Senate (its another question entirely whether the Senate responds to that pressure). If the public remains evenly divided, however, the White House is more unlikely to benefit from highlighting the issue.

So why cant the president influence public opinion more? For one, hes not the only person or group making an appeal. Research specifically on the mechanics of going public about Supreme Court nominees finds that the president operates in an inherently competitive environment and that this competition structures the presidents approach. Charles Cameron and Jee-Kwang Park found that before 1965, presidents virtually never went public over Supreme Court nominees even when their nominees ran into trouble. Nomination hearings werent the norm until 1955, and Richard Nixon only went public once his nominees got in trouble. However, efforts became significantly more intense with Reagan. There are a few possible explanations for this change: Beginning with Sandra Day OConnor, Reagans first appointment in 1981, hearings were televised and the public was polled about the nominee. In addition, controversial decisions in the 1960s and 1970s  like those involving civil rights and abortion  may have made the Supreme Court a more important issue for the American public. Cameron and Park found presidents began to go public when and almost only when groups mobilized against the nominee. In our present-day scenario, interest groups are very likely to work against Obamas eventual nominee even if he nominates a moderate.

Were likely to end up with a battle along normal partisan lines, and most research suggests that if the fate of the nominee rests on Obamas bully pulpit, the chances of confirmation are low.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-22 17:46:10+00:00,Does Leonardo DiCaprio Deserve An Oscar? An Interrogation.,['Walt Hickey'],"Leonardo DiCaprio is probably going to win an Academy Award, his first, for his role as Hugh Glass in The Revenant. Our model tracking the race has him as an obscene favorite, every gambler this side of Dublin has him as the prohibitive leader, and nearly all the amateur modelers weve followed throughout awards season project him to be the winner. Barring a meteor strike, or some hostage-taking by Michael Fassbender, its gonna be Leo.

And were you to talk to a DiCaprio fan, its about time! The narrative being bandied about is that regardless of how you feel about his stint in The Revenant, DiCaprio deserves an Oscar. Weve read about how he and the crew of The Revenant were very cold during filming and how perhaps this might be a good argument for an Oscar win. It has been mentioned that DiCaprio was nominated four  four!  times previously and was arguably snubbed each time (for your pleasure, Ive sprinkled clips of DiCaprios snubs throughout this piece).

But heres an exercise: Make a mental list of four films that you think DiCaprio could have earned an Oscar nomination for. Mine, for example, would be Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, The Departed and Inception. But go ahead and compare those to the films he was actually nominated for: Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Wolf of Wall Street. I remember nothing from Blood Diamond. Do you?

Still, the narrative is what it is, so its time to answer the immortal question: Does DiCaprio deserve an Academy Award?

Interactive: Our elections-style Oscar model looks at the predictive power of film awards over the past 25 years and tracks this years nominees and winners to try to gauge the race in the big six Academy Award categories. See the state of the Oscars race 

First, lets check out his credentials. We want to know, essentially, how many good movies DiCaprio has made and how they stack up against the pre-Oscar resumes of those who have been honored with a top acting prize. We can do this by simply counting up films with high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, but we can also take it a step further and see how that figure translates to an annualized rate.

Last week, I analyzed who had the best and worst careers after winning a best actor or best actress award. For that analysis, I studied actors and actresses who have won best actor and actress Oscars since 1970, for a total data set of 45 actor wins and 45 actress wins. Although that analysis pertained to post-Oscar work, it was just as easy to pull the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each performers pre-Oscar films. For todays analysis, I tallied how many rated films those performers were in before winning an Oscar, how many of those films received ratings of at least 50 percent, 75 percent or 90 percent on the Tomatometer, and how long the performers worked before their Oscar win. Where does DiCaprio land?

Well, hes qualified, but its not like hes the most qualified ever. DiCaprio has appeared in 37 films over 24 years, 21 of which were rated 50 percent or higher, 14 of those were rated 75 percent or higher, and two were rated 90 or higher. Not unimpressive by any means!

PERFORMER OSCAR WIN YEARS BETWEEN 75%+ FILMS 1 Emma Thompson 1992 0.8 2 Diane Keaton 1977 0.9 3 Meryl Streep 1982 1.0 3 Sean Penn 2008 1.0 3 Philip Seymour Hoffman 2005 1.0 3 Jean Dujardin 2011 1.0 3 Louise Fletcher 1975 1.0 8 Jack Nicholson 1975 1.1 8 Sean Penn 2003 1.1 10 Gene Hackman 1971 1.2 10 Robert Duvall 1983 1.2 ... 32 Marlon Brando 1972 1.7 33 Robert De Niro 1980 1.7 33 Leonardo DiCaprio  1.7 35 Susan Sarandon 1995 1.8 36 Matthew McConaughey 2013 1.8 ... Best actor and best actress resumes before Oscar win

Through 2015, DiCaprio has made a movie rated 75 percent or higher about once every 20 months, the same rate as Robert De Niro when he won the 1980 best actor Oscar for Raging Bull. But DiCaprio rates only a hair better than Matthew McConaughey did when McConaughey won the 2013 best actor award. If DiCaprio wins this year, hell be tied for the 33rd-most-successful pre-Oscar career of the 90 winners we tracked (plus DiCaprio).

On the other hand, DiCaprio would be one of the worst in the set if we were focusing on how often actors appeared in truly great films, the ones rated 90 percent or higher. With two films rated 90 or higher over a 24-year career, hed be in 63rd place, tied with the careers of Kathy Bates before her 1990 win and Julia Roberts before her 2000 win.

Still, based on the data, DiCaprios career certainly looks like the careers of other Oscar winners.

So lets concede that DiCaprio deserves an Oscar based on his career thus far. That raises the question: Who else deserves one?

A crapload of people is who. A big part of Camp DiCaprios argument is that hes been nominated multiple times before this year and lost each time, so it seems that his supporters believe multiple unfulfilled nominations constitute a debt that can only be settled with a future victory.

In Oscar history there are 51 performers, DiCaprio included, who have been nominated three times or more for an Academy Award in the acting categories yet have never won. Of those 51 performers, 28 are still alive.

I pulled the data on these 28 performers from Rotten Tomatoes to find out how often they acted in movies rated 75 percent and up and 90 percent and up.

Thirteen of the 28 performers have matched or beaten DiCaprios 14 films rated 75 percent or higher. And 23 of them have bested DiCaprio in the 90 percent category, having made three or more such highly-regarded films.

Lets not be reckless, though: Leo is a young man. Some of these performers have been at it for decades. Lets normalize things to a rate of films per year.

By my reckoning, 22 living actors at minimum can claim they deserve an Oscar more than DiCaprio, by one methodology or another. Twenty-two performers who were nominated three times or more have acted in films rated 90 percent or higher more often than Leo. Eight of those performers have also acted in films rated 75 percent or higher more often than Leo. Those actors are bolded in the table.

AVG. YEARS BETWEEN ... PERFORMER ACTING NOMINATIONS 75%+ RATED FILMS 90%+ RATED FILMS Matt Damon 3 1.0 2.3 Amy Adams 5 1.3 2.5 Laura Linney 3 1.6 2.6 Mark Ruffalo 3 1.6 3.2 Ed Harris 4 1.4 3.4 Sigourney Weaver 3 1.9 4.2 Tom Cruise 3 1.9 4.3 Kirk Douglas 3 2.6 4.6 Bradley Cooper 3 2.0 4.7 Glenn Close 6 1.7 4.7 Johnny Depp 3 1.3 5.2 Albert Finney 5 2.3 5.2 Annette Bening 4 2.1 5.4 Joan Allen 3 2.1 6.0 Edward Norton 3 1.7 6.3 Brad Pitt 3 1.4 6.5 Michelle Williams 3 1.8 7.0 Nick Nolte 3 1.7 7.6 Michelle Pfeiffer 3 3.0 8.3 Warren Beatty 4 3.9 8.5 Angela Lansbury 3 3.7 8.9 Joaquin Phoenix 3 2.9 9.7 Leonardo DiCaprio 5 1.7 12.0 Who deserves an Oscar more than Leo? Source: ROTTEN TOMATOES

And thats a partial list! You could make a lot of arguments about actors outside of this set who probably deserve Oscars based on their past work. For example, Ian McKellen  who lost the 1998 best actor award to Roberto Benigni and the 2001 best supporting actor award to Jim Broadbent  has had a legendary career, but nobodys talking about a snub for him in Mr. Holmes.

But heres whats absolutely crazy about this year and the narrative thats built up around the best actor race. Lets say DiCaprio deserves an Oscar. You know who deserves one more? Matt Damon, a guy whos also nominated for best actor this year!

Not only is DiCaprio not the actor most overdue for an Oscar, hes not even the most overdue among this years nominees.

Sure, DiCaprio is essentially a lock to win. But when the statues are allocated and the afterparty is over, DiCaprio better send his press people a mighty gift basket for making this narrative happen. And Damon should probably make some phone calls inquiring about how to get a convincing bear on Mars for the sequel, The Martian II: When Science Went Too Far.","['rated', 'performers', 'deserve', 'dicaprio', 'actor', 'interrogation', '75', 'does', 'oscar', 'films', '90', 'leonardo', 'best', 'higher']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 16:02:19+00:00,When Will Flints Water Be Safe To Drink?,['Anna Maria Barry-jester'],"FLINT, Mich.  Pat Legg says she might never drink the water from her faucet again. In her hometown of Flint, a man-made disaster allowed lead and bacteria to leach into city water from corroded pipes and fixtures, and Legg says her trust in the system corroded as well. But unlike the citys infrastructure, that trust might not be reparable.

Legg moved to Flint in 1969, during the citys more prosperous years, to work as a music historian at the citys once grand public library system. Now 71, petite with thick glasses and cropped gray hair, she spends her retirement playing bassoon in the symphonic wind ensemble, serving on the board of a housing development corporation and volunteering as the administrative assistant at her church. Shes a model citizen who cares deeply for Flint, in other words. And shes one of many residents who haul cases of crinkly plastic bottles home from churches and fire departments so they can cook with and drink bottled water.

Legg learned about the contamination in October, when the city declared a public health emergency. In April 2014, Flints water source was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River, ostensibly to keep costs down, without the addition of appropriate corrosion control. For the next 18 months, government agencies were adamant that it hadnt created a problem, in spite of complaints from residents and abundant evidence to the contrary. It wasnt until January of this year that the state and federal government declared a state of emergency, freeing up funds and resources to help the citys residents.

Once that happened, Legg asked the city to test the water in her new home near the center of town. Several weeks later, a letter came in the mail revealing that the sample had 257 parts per billion of lead, 17 times the federal limit of 15 ppb. She says there were no instructions about what to do next. There was a paper with the results, but there was nothing else in the envelope. Were not getting any information, Legg said.

What comes next in Flint is equally unclear. The water source has been switched back to Lake Huron, but the damage to the pipes remains. Today, teams from federal, state and local agencies are fanned out across the city, testing hundreds of homes in an effort to determine when the water will be safe again. Residents like Legg say, however, that the answer cant come from a lab. After more than 18 months of what many see as betrayal by local, state and federal officials, residents now view the testing with suspicion and, perhaps more importantly, are aware of gaps in federal and state regulations that oversee water safety. Residents say that no matter what the current water tests yield, they wont trust the water until Flint has replaced all of the citys aging pipes. How can you trust the data when the agencies that gather it have been so untrustworthy?

What went wrong in Flint: Last month, Anna Maria Barry-Jester wrote about how the residents of Flint were poisoned. Local, state and federal agencies collected insufficient data and ignored the warning signs in what they did collect. If it werent for residents and crusading experts, we still wouldnt know the truth. Read more 

The skepticism was palpable at Jackie and John Pembertons house on Flints southeast side on a blisteringly cold Wednesday this month. The Environmental Protection Agency called Jackie, a retiree with straight, graying hair and wire-rimmed glasses, and asked whether someone could come and test the water as part of an effort to follow up with houses that showed high lead in previous months. (When their water was tested in August, a sample from the Pembertons kitchen sink found 6 ppb of lead.) Jackie opened the front door for a three-woman team who bustled in carrying a baby-blue cooler with ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES scrawled on top. They went to the kitchen, opened the tap that had been unused since the night before and filled more than a dozen wide-mouthed plastic bottles, one after another, so that each contained the water from 10 feets worth of pipe. By the time all the bottles were filled, the samples represented water from the faucet all the way to the citys main lines. That should help testers determine where the lead is coming from.

Best case, it could take a month or two, but given the length of time these pipes were corroding, we think it could take longer, more like four to six months.

On Monday, the state released results from the DEQs first round of testing on half the high-risk homes, which showed that 10.9 percent had lead levels above 15 ppb.This technique is part of extensive testing, called sequential sampling, that the EPA is performing on about 100 homes. Although some residents are concerned about the agencys early role in the crisis  documents show that high-ranking EPA officials knew about the corrosion concerns long before that information was made public  the agency has taken control over water testing in Flint. Other tests are also being done, including the first fully compliant testing, which will be performed in two stages in 402 high-risk homes by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and overseen by the EPA. Thats the same DEQ that allowed the city to skip corrosion control and mangled testing in 2014 and 2015 by using out-of-date methods, among other questionable practices. For independent verification of the DEQ results, and to give peace of mind to residents, the EPA also plans to pay for Virginia Tech researchers to repeat the study they performed in August 2015 that first revealed widespread lead in Flints water.

Mark Durno, the on-scene coordinator for the EPA in Flint, says that early results show that the water quality is improving and that service pipes and older fixtures within homes are likely responsible for much of the lead in the water. Hes optimistic that a protective biofilm will rebuild within city pipes by late summer, bringing 90 percent of water samples under the action threshold of 15 ppb so that the city will be in line with federal law. Best case, it could take a month or two, but given the length of time these pipes were corroding, we think it could take longer, more like four to six months, he said. Still, he recognizes that simply complying with federal regulations at this point wont cut it for many residents.

What do you tell people? Test 10 times? Twenty times? A hundred times? That doesnt mean if you test 101 times you wont find a chunk of lead in your water.

Thats partly because residents are now well-informed of the many limitations of federal water-safety regulations. In order for the city to be deemed compliant, 90 percent of homes tested need to have lead in water under 15 ppb, and the other 10 percent can have any level  in Flint, the worst-hit homes are currently testing in the thousands, sometimes more than 100 times the federal action limit. Because the city does not have a map of high-risk homes, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has said all homes should be tested for lead. Of the approximately 9,000 homes that have been tested to date, 700 had lead readings of 15 ppb or higher, and an additional 1,000 had readings from 5 ppb to 14 ppb.

Additionally, lead levels can vary from one test to the next. Marc Edwards, who led the Virginia Tech research team that helped expose the problem of lead in the water, says that in decades past, experts believed the risk of lead in water was consistent over time (and it may have been). But as pipes all over the country have begun to deteriorate, there is a risk of lead pieces breaking off into the water  a particular problem in Flint, says Edwards, given the extensive damage done to the citys pipes over the year and a half that they were exposed to corrosive water. Those can flake off at any time, making it hard to say definitively when the risk is gone. What do you tell people? Test 10 times? Twenty times? A hundred times? That doesnt mean if you test 101 times you wont find a chunk of lead in your water, Edwards said.

Residents also dont see the federal action level of 15 ppb as the cutoff point for their concern. Based on decades of research and a dozen high-quality studies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations on lead in 2012, saying there is no safe level of lead in blood and no safe amount of exposure.

In a news release, the DEQ said it is automatically sending a health official to homes where water tests higher than 100 ppb. In January and February, 134 homes had samples above that level, according to state data.

At the Pembertons, as EPA workers explained the testing procedure to Jackie, John muttered at the kitchen table that it didnt really matter to him what they found. Later that morning, he clarified his feelings. I dont really trust the EPA. I trust those three nice women, but I dont trust the EPA. Hed wait until Virginia Tech came back to retest his water to decide whether it was safer. The one thing Virginia Tech has never done since the beginning is lie to us. Everyone else did, John Pemberton said.

All we ask is that Flint meet the same lousy standard of other cities. Once they do that, people can at least make their own decisions.

In the U.S., we have assumptions about basic protections, access to clean water being one of the most fundamental, said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. As Americans, there is this social contract that we have and expect, and when that falls apart as systemically as it has in Flint, its very hard to know how to rebuild that, Suh said. The council has brought a lawsuit on behalf of residents against many of the officials involved in the water crisis.

Theres evidence from previous water scandals that people dont return to tap water after theyve lost confidence. Edwards says problems with the Washington, D.C., water authority in the 1990s had left residents there concerned about water safety. When a second water crisis hit the city in the early 2000s, many residents were spared its full effects because they were still drinking bottled water, Edwards said.

Edwards is not convinced that Flint residents will recover their trust for public officials after all theyve been through, but he thinks its important that the city get in line with federal law, so residents at least have an accurate picture of what they are dealing with. All we ask is that Flint meet the same lousy standard of other cities. Once they do that, people can at least make their own decisions.

Although the Pembertons first round of testing back in August showed 6 ppb of lead, below the action level, they dont expect to drink it again, particularly after a recent decline in Johns health. They say a visit to the doctor late last month showed that John had reduced kidney function and anemia. Jackie knows they probably wont be able to link his new health problems to the water, even if it was to blame. Im afraid its just going to be brushed off as old age, she said.

Given the damage thats been done, Legg, the Pembertons and other residents have made clear what it will take for them to accept the water as safe: the replacement of all 15,000 pipes suspected of containing lead in the city. You can run all the clean water you want through the pipes, Legg said. If theyre corroded, its not safe.

The EPA wont pay to change out the citys lead pipes, Durno says, but he thinks it would be a good move. The more that happens across the U.S., the less we have to worry about these types of situations. But its a tall order, and its an expensive order.

Flint Mayor Karen Weaver recently released a plan for changing out the citys damaged pipes. Snyder has acknowledged that even though many experts believe the interior of the pipes can be recoated, that probably wont be enough for residents, according to the Detroit Free Press. Weaver estimates that replacing the pipes will cost $55 million, an enormous amount for a city riddled with debt and poverty. But its money the city and state cant afford not to spend, residents say.

Many experts agree, pointing out that we have to deal with our aging infrastructure if we really want to deal with the lead problem, not just treat kids after its in their bodies. Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who has studied low-level lead exposure for more than two decades, points out that the public health field understandably focuses on kids with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter, who on average suffer larger losses in cognitive function than kids with lower levels of lead in their blood. But Lanphear says many more children have blood lead levels between 1 and 5 g/dL, and they probably account for a much larger percentage of overall reduced cognitive function in the U.S. population.

To deal with this as the broader problem it is, rather than on a crisis-by-crisis basis, would require major investments in infrastructure that the U.S. has been unwilling to make in recent years. The international outrage over Flint has in large part occurred because this was a totally preventable problem. Lanphear agrees but says this argument misses an important point: All lead exposure should be considered preventable, especially if you factor in the long and well-documented history of lead industry influence that kept lead in our pipes and on our walls long after we knew of its dangers. If we dont deal with that legacy, how can people really believe they are going to be safe?","['city', 'drink', 'lead', 'flints', 'homes', 'federal', 'pipes', 'safe', 'times', 'water', 'testing', 'flint', 'residents']"
fivethirtyeight,2014-11-21 17:46:32+00:00,Skeptical Football: Patriots vs. Cardinals And An Interactive History Of The NFL,['Benjamin Morris'],"The first 10 games of the NFL season are its exposition period  we get to know the characters and themes that we expect to see develop as the race to the playoffs unfolds. This year, like nearly every other in the past decade, the New England Patriots refusal to regress to the mean is a central storyline.

Remember back when the Patriots were 0-1 and faced a must-win in Week 2? Well, they won. Then in Week 4 they dropped to 2-2, and the end of an era was supposedly nigh. Except no. Pats will be Pats, and now theyve won their last six games en route to the best record in the AFC. That streak has included comfortable wins against the Cincinnati Bengals (who at one point projected to have the best record), the surprisingly strong Buffalo Bills, and Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. (The Patriots are also tied with the Green Bay Packers for a league-leading point differential). And according to my colleague Neil Paine, the Patriots are really a second-half team. I shudder to think.

But theres another storyline thats dominated the exposition period: The best record in the NFL belongs to the 9-1 Arizona Cardinals. While theyve beaten some decent teams like Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco, they dont have what the yakkers call a signature win. They have only the seventh-best SRS in football, second to the Packers in the NFC, and only a half-point ahead of the defending champion Seattle Seahawks (who have four losses).

Aside from being the class of their respective conferences so far this year, the two franchises have little in common. The Cardinals have now secured their second winning season in a row  and can count that as an accomplishment in light of their 90-year history of losing. Although the Patriots dominance of the regular season continues apace, they will likely be disappointed if they dont win their first Super Bowl in 10 years.

To illustrate just how divergent these two franchises have been, I created a chart to show the entire history of the NFL (or at least what we have stats for). This is the cumulative regular-season point differential since 1920, for all teams (with the Patriots and the Cardinals highlighted):

The current Patriots dynasty is lengthy and steep, and belongs in the same group as the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, the Cleveland Browns of the 50s and 60s, or the Chicago Bears of the 30s and 40s (especially when you factor in league parity).

That chart is fun, but it would be a lot more useful if we could make out all 81 NFL franchises individually. Well ...

Chart of the week

Thanks to the great work of designated Skeptical Football charts guru Reuben Fischer-Baum, you can do just that. Roll over a line to see the teams entire history, and move along the line to see exactly how many points it has scored compared to its opponents at a given point. You can also click on a team to keep its line highlighted, and then roll over another team for comparison. Irrelevant dates (where no regular-season games were played) are excluded from the timeline.

Here are a couple of things I found from the interactive that I thought were interesting:

Even more Aaron Rodgers

First, Aaron Rodgers  apparently unmoved by my ongoing criticism of his failure to throw more interceptions  is absolutely tearing it up this year (at least when his team is ahead, which is most of the time lately). Recently, he accomplished something pretty cool that I didnt know about:

On Sept. 25, 2011, Rodgers threw three touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 27-17. With that result, the Packers had scored 2,991 more points than their opponents all-time, ahead of the Bears 2,989  and the Packers havent looked back. As of last Sunday, Green Bay held the NFLs best historical margin of victory by 358 points.

Comment of the week

Last week Neil Paine and I wrote an article titled Randy Moss May Well Have Been The Greatest Receiver Of All Time  which focused on the insane With Or Without You stats that Moss put up in his career. In the discussion, we raised the possibility that if receivers can have as much of an impact as Randy Moss appeared to have, that may cast doubt on some previous knowledge  like how good of a quarterback Joe Montana was considering he had Jerry Rice running routes for so long.

A few different people in the comments and elsewhere raised the point that Joe Montana had already won two Super Bowls before Jerry Rice arrived in San Francisco:

Upon further consideration, Im inclined to agree that its fairly unlikely that Rice was the driving force behind the 49ers success. But Im not so sure Montana was either.

Winning in the NFL can happen for a lot of different reasons  a star quarterback (think Peyton Manning), a successful new offensive or defensive strategy (think West Coast offense, zone blitz, or, more recently, the Wildcat), or a standout player who creates mismatches that other teams struggle with (think Randy Moss). But the effects of various win-generating phenomena can come in a lot of shapes and sizes.

For example, lets compare the 49ers to the St. Louis Rams. Pay particular attention to the Greatest Show on Turf era from 1999 into the early 2000s:

The Greatest Show on Turf Rams had a few different things going for them, but their success was sudden, rocky, and lasted only a few years. They broke the game for a while in the sense that they were something the rest of the NFL didnt know how to deal with. But despite having a lasting effect on how football is played, their dominance was fragile.

On the other hand, from the early 80s to the late 90s, the 49ers outscored their opponents by around 2,500 points  by far the most dominant stretch in the Super Bowl era. And they did it with a practically straight line, meaning they were better than their opposition by a nearly constant amount.

If the 49ers owed a significant part of their success to any one player (or phenomenon of any kind), wed likely see more variety in the teams arc as that players performance fluctuated, or as he was injured, or left. But the consistency of the 49ers ascension suggests they were more of an organization-driven phenomenon. At the very least, it implies that they were the sum of many different quality parts.

Playing around with the interactive, Im fascinated by how different phenomena manifest. For example: How do the impacts of offensive and defensive innovation compare? What are the effects of a quarterback versus those of a coach? There are a lot of possibilities, so let us know what you uncover in the comments or on Twitter.

Week 11 kicking awards

I keep thinking (and my editor keeps hoping) this will be the week I wont bother talking about kickers, but then Las Vegas Locomotives alumnus Graham Gano has to go and attempt a 63-yard field goal with one second left in a thriller between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately for the Panthers, it was blocked.

My kicking model suggests that a kicker in 2014 should typically be able to make a 63-yard field goal around 40 percent of the time  but this may be skewed by the fact that such long kicks are so rarely attempted. Still, Ganos 63-yarder wasnt what earned him the kicker loss and Week 11s Least Valuable Kicker award. What did him in was his previous miss, a 46-yarder, which a 2014 NFL kicker should typically make about 77 percent of the time.

My algorithm picked the Falcons Matt Bryant as the MVK over the St. Louis Rams Greg Zeurlein (who had an excellent week, going 5/5 with two 50+ yarders in the Rams huge upset of the Broncos), on account of Bryant making four field goals in a game his team only won by two (though none was over 44 yards).

But the biggest news of the week is that with Nick Novak missing a kick for the San Diego Chargers, were down to just two perfect kickers, and theyre both veterans: the Indianapolis Colts Adam Vinatieri and the New York Giants Josh Brown.

Gunslinger of the week

There were 26 interceptions thrown in Week 11, and seven of them were thrown by the Manning brothers. Eli Manning had five in the Giants narrow loss against the 49ers  four of which were thrown with his team trailing  enough to win him our Gunslinger of the Week award.

Throwing a practically embarrassing number of interceptions now and then is something great quarterbacks do. QBs, dont be ashamed of looking bad when trying to win! A loss is a loss, whether you throw zero interceptions or six. My maxim is: If a quarterback loses a game without throwing a few interceptions, he probably didnt try hard enough.

In general, Eli Manning is a bit of an unknown. He puts up fairly big totals for a mediocre team, but often gets criticized for his high interception rate. Yet his win curve looks mostly like his big brothers, only flatter, and its plausible that his shame-free style was partially responsible for the Giants shocking wins in two Super Bowls. Elis gambling wouldnt necessarily make the Giants favorites against stronger competition, but it might have given them a better chance against a team like the 2007 Patriots than a better team with a quarterback who took fewer risks.

Just for fun, I looked at the Pro Football Reference list of quarterbacks with the most four-plus-interception games. The top four are George Blanda, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler and Terry Bradshaw (all of whom won championships, and three of whom are in the Hall of Fame). Of the top 50 such QBs, 15 have won championships (and account for 20 Super Bowls), including both brothers Manning.

Rookie QB watch

The biggest news in rookie QB-land was in Tennessee, where sixth-round-pick Zach Mettenberger had a fairly strong game against the Pittsburgh Steelers (263 yards and two touchdowns). Hes now guaranteed to reach the magical four-start line when rookie QBs are more likely to have successful careers. Im not quite ready to move him up in the rankings just yet, but every pass he completes is one more than Johnny Manziel has completed all year. As of now, Id order the rookies estimated career prospects like so:

The Jacksonville Jaguars Blake Bortles had a bye week. The Oakland Raiders Derek Carr, despite finally winning a game Thursday night (in dramatic fashion) has had a pretty weak couple of weeks, with just 172 and 174 yards in Weeks 11 and 12, despite a combined 69 pass attempts. The Minnesota Vikings Teddy Bridgewaters two game winning streak came to an end in Chicago. Mettenberger. The Patriots Jimmy Garropolo. Manziel once again got all dressed up with no ball to throw.

Not really in the game yet but worth keeping an eye on: Logan Thomas is now second on the depth chart in Arizona. So far this year he has a 108.9 NFL Passer Rating, but hes gotten it the hard way: He has only one completion in eight attempts (10 if you count sacks), but it went for 81 yards and a touchdown.

Reader response

In Week 9s column, I introduced my experimental win curves for quarterbacks, which depict how much each QB typically wins relative to various expectations, and I included a number of examples.

I covered most popular quarterbacks, with a couple of notable exceptions. One request I got an awful lot:

@skepticalsports As a Bears fan, I'd love to see the ""Win Curve"" for Jay Cutler that you wrote about in your latest @FiveThirtyEight column  John D. Kos (@johndkos) November 7, 2014

I would have included Cutler initially, but I had a problem with his curve: It was coming out as a perfectly straight line, virtually indistinguishable from the y=x guide (a highly unlikely outcome). I thought this might have been a data problem, but it turns out Cutlers results really were just too vanilla for the method I was using to pick up the variation. So I tried an alternate method that is more sensitive to small variation. The alternate method turned out to be less sensitive to large variation as well, so I was able to plot a couple more notable quarterbacks as well as Cutler:

Russell Wilson  like his comrade Andrew Luck  has a very impressive curve so far in his career, albeit over a sample still probably too small for this analysis. (He also gets very good support from a strong team around him.)

Cutlers curve is still remarkably unremarkable, but at least it shows up. He appears to do slightly above average regardless of the circumstances. As a special treat for Bears fans who had to wait two weeks  and because I wanted to see what was going into this virtually straight line  Ive broken down Cutlers curve by quarter, and compared each to the same breakdown for Peyton Manning (our standard-bearer for such things):

Being very far ahead or behind in the first quarter is rare, so you should take the tails of that quadrant with a grain of salt. In the second and fourth quarters, Cutler seems to outperform average in a pretty uniform way, and in the third-quarter he has a bit of a reverse-Matthew Stafford thing going on.

Most empirically significant game of this week

The Cardinals matchup against the defending champion Seahawks is a pretty big test for the team with the leagues best record.

But on top of that, the Cardinals have a lot of important parts coming and going, which is always empirically significant: Their top QB (Carson Palmer) is out. Last week, Cardinals backup Drew Stanton held off the Detroit Lions Stafford at the end of the game, but the Cardinals still struggled. Leading for most of the game, they rushed 26 times, but gained only 46 yards. And their top receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, is injured but may play anyway. As demonstrated in the article on Moss, the value of top-notch WRs can affect our broader understanding of the game.

And then there are the Seahawks  who were young powerhouses last year, but are possibly already in decline  and Russell Wilson, who last year averaged 33.7 yards rushing per game. Thats by far the most of any QB in a year his team won the Super Bowl  and hes averaging 57.1 per game this year. What running quarterbacks mean for the game is a fascinating open question. A lot of newer, fancier QB-rating systems are giving QBs a lot of credit for their scrambling (often much more than if you treated those plays the same as completed pass attempts). But while those individual plays can be valuable, there havent been a lot of dynamic offenses built around running QBs, and its still unclear whether this is just a bonus skill or whether it will be a necessity in the future NFL.

Its perhaps even more valuable to see Wilson in action with the Seahawks struggling a bit (it can also be harder to isolate an individual players contributions when a team is firing on all cylinders). Hell be tested against a Cardinals defense that grades out as one of the best in the NFL this year  a perfect opportunity to see what both are made of.

Reminder: If you tweet questions to me @skepticalsports, there is a non-zero chance that Ill answer them here.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-21 05:16:59+00:00,Trump Optimists And Trump Skeptics Are About To Go To War,['Nate Silver'],"If you think the arguments between the Republican candidates have been bad, well, you aint seen nothing yet. Pundits, reporters and political analysts are going to really have at it. Two competing theories about the Republican race are about to come to a head, and both of them can claim a victory of sorts after South Carolina.

The first theory is simple. It can be summarized in one word: Trump! The more detailed version would argue the following:

Trump has easily won two of the first three states.

Trump is ahead in the polls in pretty much every remaining state.

Trump is ahead in delegates  in fact, he may win all 50 delegates from South Carolina.

Trump has been extremely resilient despite pundits constantly predicting his demise. Hes been at 35 percent in national polls for months now. Thats as steady as it gets!

So, um, isnt it obvious that Trump is going to be the Republican nominee?

Not so, say the Trump skeptics. Their case is pretty simple also:

Trump is winning states, but hes only getting about one-third of the vote.

Trump has a relatively low ceiling on his support.

Trump now has a chief rival: Florida senator Marco Rubio.

What did the Trump skeptics find to like about South Carolina? Quite a lot, actually. Theyd point out that Trump faded down the stretch run, getting 32 percent of the vote after initially polling at about 36 percent after New Hampshire, because of his continuing struggles with late-deciding voters. Theyd note that Trumps numbers worsened from New Hampshire to South Carolina despite several candidates having dropped out. Theyd say that Rubio, who went from 11 percent in South Carolina polls before Iowa to 22 percent of the vote on Saturday night, had a pretty good night. Theyd also say that Rubio will be helped by Jeb Bush dropping out, even if it had already become clear that Rubio was the preferred choice of Republican Party elites.

So what? sayeth the Trump optimists. Second place means youre a loser! Theres no guarantee that the other candidates will drop out any time soon. And as Trump himself has argued, its a mistake to assume that all of the support from Bush and other candidates will wind up in Rubios column. Some of it will go to Trump!

Indeed, other candidates remaining in the race are a big problem for Trump skeptics. Bush is gone, but John Kasich is still in, and he may hinder Rubio in states like Ohio. More importantly, Ted Cruz is still winning something like 20 percent of the Republican vote. Although Cruzs delegate math doesnt look good  his strongest states are those that allocate their delegates proportionally, whereas Rubio and Trump are variously strong in winner-take-all states  hell stay in the race through Super Tuesday and possibly for a lot longer.

Trump optimists other point is more of a straw man argument, however. The Trump skeptics arent presuming that Rubio will magically pick up all the support from Bush (and eventually, from Kasich and Cruz). Theyre looking at polls that have consistently shown Rubio picking up more second-choice support than Trump does. In some polls, thats enough for Rubio to tie or overtake Trump. In others it isnt. But virtually all polls have the race getting closer as the field winnows. Likewise, almost all polls (both state polls and national polls) show Rubio with higher favorability ratings than Trump.

I should note that the Trump skeptics find the Trump optimists a bit exasperating on this point. (Why are you talking about yourself in the third person, Nate?) The idea that Trump has a ceiling  or to be more precise, will encounter a lot of upward resistance as he seeks to gain more support  is not some type of special pleading. Instead, its a point the Trump skeptics have raised from the very earliest stages of Trumps campaign. And theyve seen some evidence to validate it from Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, along with recent polling.

A reasonable person might adjudicate the case as follows: Yes, if the Republican nomination becomes a two-man race between Trump and Rubio, it could be pretty close. But that might not happen, or it at least might not happen for a while, not until Trump is off to a pretty big head start in delegates. What happens in a three-way race between Trump, Rubio and Cruz is a little murky. This reasonable person would concede that Rubio had a chance. But whos the favorite? Trump!

The Trump skeptics might bring up one last line of argument. Theyd claim, perhaps more tentatively than they did before, that GOP elites still have some ability to influence the race. Maybe voters dont care about what the establishment thinks, but individual Republican politicians can still have some influence  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haleys endorsement of Rubio very probably helped him, for instance. These elites have quite a bit of money to throw around, especially with Bush out. They have some more subtle advantages: They can pack a debate hall with Rubio supporters, for instance. Or they could try to rule by brute force: If the Republican race goes to a contested convention, which is not at all unimaginable, were suddenly back in the pre-1972, smoke-filled-rooms era, although probably with delegates vaping instead of puffing on cigars.

Betting markets, weighing all of this information, see the Republican race thusly: Trump at about 50 percent to win the nomination, Rubio at 40 percent, and the rest of the field at 10 percent. I might quibble here and there, but that seems like basically a sound assessment. Now, lets get back to arguing on Twitter.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 20:37:15+00:00,Bill Self Is Finally Warming Up To The 3-Pointer,['Matt Giles'],"During Kansass win over Oklahoma on Feb. 13, the Jayhawks attempted 26 3-point field goals, tying a season high against Division I competition. Across college basketball, 2-point field goals are at an all-time low, with D-I teams attempting about 35 percent of their field goals from beyond the arc. Today, the three accounts for a greater proportion of points than it has since at least 2002.

When viewed through that prism, the 48 percent perimeter rate in KUs victory appears normal, if a little above average. But if one considers that Bill Self has been the Jayhawks coach for the past 13 seasons, that same percentage might cause a double take.

Self is one of the finest coaches in the college games modern era. He has coached the Jayhawks to 11 straight Big 12 regular-season titles, won an NCAA title, reached another Final Four and seen 13 players leave Kansas as first-round draft picks. But there is a constant for each of those seasons spent in Lawrence: Self does not like 3-pointers. He has continually waved the anti-threes banner, defending the bygone era when a 21-foot shot was a long 2 and the only recorded three-point plays were and-1s.

What is so interesting about Self, says ESPN analyst and tempo-free guru John Gasaway, is not that Kansas doesnt shoot threes  there are coaches whose teams attempt fewer  but that his squads are steady in how few they attempt. Their 3-point attempts percentages never waver.

He is yelling Stop! and is clearly trying to stand and thwart this Steph Curry NBA history. None of this is for him.

Self wasnt always such a threetotaler. His last two Illinois seasons were filled with players who would consistently connect from deep, and those squads rates ranked within Ken Pomeroys top 100 database. But something clicked within Self when he swapped high-major conferences. He came to Kansas and immediately shut the faucet off, says Jesse Newell, who covers the Jayhawks for the Kansas City Star and who in jest initiated a #freethe3 Twitter movement last season.

During the 2003-04 season, his first at Kansas, only 29.2 percent of the teams field goals were from beyond the arc, and the needle has barely moved since, rising as high as 32.4 percent and dipping to 26.1 percent. As Self mentioned last February, Based on our history and the success that weve had with our shot selection over the years, I think 30 percent is a pretty good number for us.

Self prefers his offense be run through the Jayhawk bigs, which means either high-lows between the power forwards and centers, big-to-big passing or an inside-out game  that is, look to score within 10 feet of the hoop and, when need be (i.e. when doubled or facing the raking hands of pesky smaller defenders), kick to the perimeter for an open look. For Self, good offense is getting the ball as close to the rim as possible. And that is fine  the best shot is often the one with the highest chance of going in.

When Self coached the Morrii or Darnell Jackson, this strategy made sense. But then the type of big Self featured as an offensive anchor up and vanished. Perry Ellis, a senior at Kansas this season, will go down as one of the all-time KU greats, but the three-year starter and Sunflower State native is more of a hybrid big than the traditional Self-style bruiser. Ellis is capable of scoring in the post, but he is equally gifted facing up, dribble-driving from the top of the arc or pulling up from the elbow. The high-low game has worked in spurts and is still used as a framework, but not with the same effectiveness it showed in the past. Jamari Traylor, Landen Lucas and Cheick Diallo are no Thomas Robinson or Jackson.

According to Hoop-Math.com, since the 2011-12 season (and not including 2016), roughly 37 percent of Kansass half-court attempts were at the rim. This season, that rate has dropped to 34 percent. To the college basketball observer, this change doesnt seem that substantial, but to Self, it is another sign the game he has controlled for years is teetering on the verge of change. He wants to get Kansas back to the glory days of old, says Newell.

During the Jayhawks NCAA tournament loss to Wichita State last March, Self was particularly apoplectic. KU had attempted five 3-pointers before the second media timeout (making only one), and according to Newell, Self laid into his squad: He asked them, All you guys want to shoot threes  how soft are you? For Self, its a mindset, but it does have a subconscious impact on his players.

Not that Self confines this mindset to the sideline:

[Making 3s is] fools gold ... You want to [make 50 percent of threes], but if thats what you play to, then youre not going to be able to hang your hat on that if you play a team that takes away the threes and forces you to score inside and things like that, and you cant do it. Youll end up going home sad ... Thats the name of the game, in my opinion, is getting easy baskets and eliminating easy baskets. And were not doing near a good enough job of doing that inside. (February 2015)

I probably changed too much last year ... obviously there the last half of the season, we were an outside-in-type team. We still wanted to play through our bigs, but not like we have in the past. I dont think that we ran near as good of offense last year. (May 2015)

When we make shots, we relax defensively ... I think we lost a little bit of energy or a little bit of focus defensively when we made shots. (November 2015)

Like Phil Jacksons Triangle, Selfs philosophy on threes informs his philosophy on the game as a whole, and that bedrock isnt going to change easily. When highly successful coaches adapt and succeed, like win a championship, we say they adapted to their players, Gasaway says. Self does not adapt to his players.

Players notice. Conner Frankamp was a talented shooter who, after playing one season at Kansas, abruptly chose to transfer to Wichita State. Mitchell Ballock, one of the best long-range marksmen in the 2017 class, recently spurned a Kansas offer and committed to Creighton, saying, At the end of the day, I was looking for the best situation for me that would let me excel as a player. I just really believe Creighton gives me the best opportunity to do that.

This season, though, Selfs hand has been forced. His team is just too good from beyond the arc to do anything but fire off threes. Wayne Selden is a 6-foot-5 wing and Big 12 player of the year candidate. Selden has limitless range, is strong enough to take a bump as he rises from deep and shoots 41.9 percent on 5.2 threes per game. Self likes to pair Frank Mason and Devonte Graham  roughly a third of the Jayhawks lineups feature the jet-quick guards  because they can either break down the defense off the dribble and find open Jayhawks or stop on a sneaker-squeak and connect. The two make a combined 40.2 percent of their threes on 7 attempts.

Brannen Greene, who barely leaves the bench, may be Selfs best shooter  he sees action in just 27.4 percent of the teams minutes yet connects on 53.8 percent of his threes, an automatic threat when he spots up in the corner. Even Ellis, who epitomizes Selfs paint-scoring hopes and dreams, has expanded his offensive repertoire: He has attempted 48 threes, a career high, and is converting at 47.9 percent. Hes developed into a skilled pick-and-pop 4, freeing the interior for dribble penetration from Mason and Graham.

According to Synergy Sports, Kansas ranks fourth nationally with 1.25 points scored per possession on those that end with a 3-point attempt, the most ever for a Self team. The D-I leader, though, is Oklahoma (1.27), and therein lies the rub. Fans would like Kansas to resemble the Sooners, to lighten the rigidity of the offense and give the players more freedom. Buddy Hield is a delight to watch, a guard seemingly without conscience whose game, which includes his ability to shake free a defender to not only attempt but make threes, is Curry-esque. But picture Hield in a Jayhawk jersey (it could have happened) and there is no way the senior guard would have attempted 224 threes by late February. He would likely be a different type of player  still great, but not this transcendent from the perimeter.

Close observers see Self taking baby steps toward acknowledging that for this 2016 squad to fulfill its destiny, he has to change. During nonconference play, 31.8 percent of the teams attempts were 3-pointers. For the first eight Big 12 games, that rate slightly increased (to 33.3 percent), but since the late January loss to Iowa State, the KU offense has undergone a revolution  its now at 40.5 percent. The squad has gone 7-0 during that span, and for perhaps the first time in his Kansas tenure, Self has realized his team is simply too talented from the perimeter to maintain a stranglehold on the offense.","['good', 'jayhawks', 'season', '3pointer', 'bill', 'threes', 'kansas', 'teams', 'finally', 'game', 'team', 'offense', 'self', 'warming']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-21 04:59:56+00:00,"Bernie Sanders Makes Progress, But Hillary Clinton Remains The Favorite",['Harry Enten'],"The Democratic contest moved to a not-totally-white state, and Hillary Clinton had her best showing yet. She won the Nevada caucuses by over 5 percentage points, an important margin in a state whose electorate was only 59 percent white. While there are still some questions about how Latinos voted, Clinton can claim tremendous support from black voters heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.

According to the entrance poll in Nevada, Clinton won black voters 76 percent to 22 percent. To put that in context, Clintons margin is only slightly smaller than Barack Obamas 83 percent to 14 percent win with black voters in the 2008 Nevada caucuses. While the result wasnt unexpected given that pre-election polls showed Clinton dominant with black voters, Sanders spent a lot of money on television in the state. That Sanders couldnt close the gap with black voters with a big advertising push is a very ominous sign for his campaign.

Many of the upcoming primaries will feature a much higher percentage of black voters than Nevada did. While only 13 percent of Nevada caucus-goers in 2016 were black, their share in South Carolina will be much higher (55 percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters were black in 2008). Thats why Clinton is up by 25 percentage points in the South Carolina polls. Even beyond South Carolina, on Super Tuesday 63 percent of the delegates up for grabs will be in contests with a higher share of African-Americans than Nevada. Better yet for Clinton, 35 percent of delegates will be up for grabs in contests with at least double the share of African-Americans as Nevada. In 2008, 19 percent of voters in all Democratic primaries were black  Clintons margin among black voters is a big advantage.

Thats not to say Nevada was all bad news for Sanders. Sanders has cut into Clintons advantage with Latino voters. In the 2008 Nevada caucuses, Clinton won Latinos 64 percent to 26 percent. This year, the entrance poll had Sanders winning Latinos 53 percent to 45 percent. Im a bit skeptical of those numbers, however, given that Clinton won in heavily Latino precincts in Las Vegas. The sample of Latino voters in the entrance poll was very small, a couple hundred respondents at most, so its possible those numbers are just off. (That said, David Shor of Civis Analytics argued that it is possible that Sanders won Latinos even as he did poorly in Latino neighborhoods because many younger Latinos  who are more likely to support Sanders  live in whiter neighborhoods.)

But whether he won them or not, Sanders was clearly competitive with Latinos, which really shouldnt be too surprising: A recent SurveyMonkey poll found Sanders closing the gap among Latinos to just 3 percentage points, and a NBC News/Telemundo survey put Clintons lead with Latino voters at 17 percentage points. Clinton isnt running away among Latinos. That could be good news for Sanders in states like Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Texas that vote in March. Still, Sanders is fighting an uphill battle given that many more March primaries have a large African-American electorate.

But in some ways Sanders has already won something: The Democratic electorate turning out in 2016 is more liberal than the one that turned out in the partys last competitive primary eight years ago. Democratic voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada this year were far more likely to describe themselves as liberal than they were in 2008. In Nevada, 70 percent of Democrats said they were liberal compared to just 45 percent in 2008. Sixty-eight percent of Democratic voters identified as liberal in Iowa and New Hampshire.

But even with a more liberal electorate, Clinton was able to carry the day. Nevada is likely to be the first in a string of victories for her campaign.","['sanders', 'latinos', 'clinton', 'voters', 'remains', 'favorite', 'hillary', 'won', 'black', 'democratic', 'progress', '2008', 'nevada', 'makes', 'south', 'bernie']"
fivethirtyeight,2014-10-16 16:33:09+00:00,The Playoff Implications Of Every Game For Every NFL Team,"['Reuben Fischer-baum', 'Mike Beuoy']","Playoff Implications is a phrase you usually dont hear until the final weeks of the NFL regular season, but almost every regular season game has playoff implications. In the early going, however, it can be difficult to figure out just what those implications are, and how much is riding on each game.

Most other major sports leagues play a greater number of regular season games, and thus the playoff picture in those sports evolves in a more incremental fashion. The pace can seem glacial at times for MLB, and inevitable and foregone when it comes to the NBA. But with just 16 regular season games, the NFLs playoff landscape can change dramatically over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. And these tectonic shifts take place throughout the season, not just in those final weeks of December.

With a week or two left in the season, the eye test usually suffices for judging which games will shape the playoff picture. But in mid-October there are far too many possibilities for the unassisted human mind to make sense of. We can only speak in general terms. For example, we know the playoff chances for the New Orleans Saints will improve with a victory this Sunday over the Detroit Lions. But by how much? And how far would they drop with a loss? Expanding our focus, what other teams have a vested interest in the outcome of this game? One would expect Carolinas playoff chances to improve with a Saints loss, given that the Saints are their division rival. But once again, by how much?

To answer these questions, weve created a weekly feature that measures the playoff implications of each game. To do this, you need to be able to simulate the remainder of the season multiple times and analyze the results. And in order to simulate the season, you need a way to rank all 32 teams, and use that ranking to create outcome probabilities for future games. Weve been doing just that with FiveThirtyEights Elo rankings. But the Elo ratings, simple and beautiful, arent the only word on NFL rankings. For this feature were going to turn to the wisdom of the crowd instead, and use a ranking system one of the authors developed based on betting markets. In stock market terms, think of it as technical analysis in lieu of fundamental analysis.

Well get into the methodology in a moment but first the results. Think of each interactive table below as a playoff implications cheat sheet for this weeks upcoming games. (If you hover over a colored square, youll see details for that game.)

UPDATE (Oct. 17, 12:30 p.m.): The interactive tables above have been updated to include Thursday nights game, which now shows no playoff implications because its result is included in the playoff chances (the text of the article has not been updated).

Reading the table across tells you which teams are affected by any particular game. Reading the table down tells you which games matter most to any given team. For example, if youre a Texans fan, what games should you care about this week, how much should you care about them, and who do you want to win? The column headers are sortable, so clicking on the HOU column tells you to care about HOU @ PIT, ATL @ BAL, CIN @ IND, NYJ @ NE, CLE @ JAC, and KC @ SD  in that order. And you want the Texans, Falcons, Bengals, Jets, Jaguars and Chiefs to win.

My rankings start from the assumption that the NFL gambling market is efficient, and then attempts to determine how that efficient market ranks each of the 32 NFL teams. Unfortunately, Vegas doesnt actually share its rankings with the general public, but with a little reverse-engineering, we can arrive at a pretty good guess at what they are. We start with the point spread. For Thursday nights game, the New England Patriots are a 9.5-point favorite at home against the New York Jets. Since home field advantage is worth about 2.5 points, the market thinks the Patriots are 7 points better than the Jets when playing on a neutral field.

Armed with this interpretation, we then take the point spreads from each game and for multiple weeks and run a simple linear regression to arrive at a consensus ranking. The process is akin to drawing a map of the United States but nobody tells you a citys location. Instead, they only tell you how far away each city is from another city (e.g. Los Angeles is 1,700 miles away from Chicago, Chicago is 165 miles from Indianapolis, and so on). To further complicate matters, our map moves over time, making earlier distance measurements less reliable. For example, the Steelers opened the season as a 6-point favorite at home against the Browns. If the market were to set that point spread today, Pittsburgh would most likely drop to just a 2.5-point favorite, as the Steelers have fallen short of preseason expectations, and the Browns have exceeded them. So, the ranking methodology gives more weight to recent point spread data in an attempt to get the most up-to-date market evaluation of each team.

Now that we have a ranking system that assigns a probability to each future regular season game outcome, the next step is to simulate the season multiple times (50,000 times to be exact). After simulating win/loss records, we apply the NFL playoff seeding rules (plus tiebreakers) and summarize the results. There are already several sites that do these types of simulations for the purpose of producing team playoff odds (including FiveThirtyEight). For this feature, were going to go a bit deeper than that.

Instead of focusing on each teams overall playoff odds, lets instead focus on each game. Well use the New Orleans-Detroit game as an example. Of the 50,000 simulation runs, there were precisely 30,180 (or about 60 percent) that resulted in a Lions victory, and 19,820 that resulted in a Saints victory. Lets now focus on those two samples in isolation. Of the 30,180 simulations in which the Saints lost, they made the playoffs 8,273 times, or 27 percent. Of the 19,820 simulations in which the Saints won, they made the playoffs 9,172 times, or 46 percent. Put simply, the Saints playoff odds could swing by a not-insignificant 19 percent as a result of their game against the Lions. (The games with the most cumulative influence on the overall playoff picture (leverage) are listed at left).

We can repeat this calculation for every game and every team. The result: A measure of how much every game matters to every team.","['season', 'nfl', 'implications', 'game', 'saints', 'teams', 'playoff', 'regular', 'games', 'team', 'times', 'market']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 16:24:28+00:00,At Least 29 People Still Dont Know Who Won The Super Bowl,['Leah Libresco'],"Its been more than two weeks since the Super Bowl, and there are still at least 29 people who dont know who won. Those 29 are the recorded survivors of the Last Man challenge, a war-of-attrition, just-for-glory competition to be the last person in the U.S. (or at least in the challenges database) unaware of who won Super Bowl 50. (For all of you who still dont know who won, this post is a safe space.)

Eighty-five percent of participants have already been felled by what competitors call The Knowledge, according to the Last Man website. Sixteen percent of all players had, despite their best efforts, learned who won the Super Bowl by midnight on the night of the game (Feb. 7). By the end of the next day, more than half of the competitors had lost their blissful ignorance. The more time that passes, the safer the players are; only about a quarter of competitors who made it through the first post-Super Bowl week perished in the second. Now, as you can see in the chart above, the survivor curve is more like a plateau.

But thats no reason for the survivors to let down their guard. They could still be taken out by the kind of thing that has felled other competitors  phone calls, cupcakes, baby photos, the usual. And its not always just the Last Manners who suffer when they lose: One competitor learned the Super Bowl winner via email from treacherous husband I thought I could trust. And that husband may find that the guilt of being the spoiler weighs on him for longer than The Knowledge haunts his spouse.","['dont', 'bowl', '29', 'survivors', 'players', 'competitors', 'won', 'know', 'learned', 'man', 'super', 'knowledge']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-22 18:03:08+00:00,Whomever Obama Picks May Not Meet Scalias Definition Of Diversity,['Leah Libresco'],"Justice Antonin Scalia thought it shouldnt make too much difference who sat on the bench. If Supreme Court justices hewed to his originalist philosophy, deciding cases was a matter of applying objective criteria  personal experience shouldnt enter into it.

But in his dissent to Obergefell v. Hodges, which found that the Constitution guaranteed a right to marriage for same-sex couples, Scalia argued his colleagues had every reason to be concerned about diversity. A group of nine people who look so little like America couldnt be qualified to do the democratic work of making law. And making law (the proper function of the legislative branch, not the judiciary) was exactly what he thought his colleagues were trying to do.

Scalia ticked off the ways he and his colleagues fell short of being representative of the country:

Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination.

How likely is the next nominee or confirmed justice to address the problem of diversity and representation on the Supreme Court? We dont know the full pool of candidates President Obama is considering, but we do know one especially likely source of nominees: circuit courts. Seven of the eight current justices were serving on circuit courts when nominated, and so are several of the potential Scalia replacements whose names are being floated.

After paging through all 158 of the active federal appellate judges official biographies, articles about their appointments, and, yes, their wedding announcements, I found that the circuit courts are more diverse than the Supreme Court. That is, theyre more diverse by two of Scalias metrics: where the judges grew up and where they went to school.

Just over a quarter of circuit court judges attended either Harvard or Yale Law School, offering a number of options for breaking those schools lock on the Supreme Court. But there may be a political factor that favors the nomination of those schools alumni. Linda Greenhouse, who has covered the Supreme Court for The New York Times and teaches at Yale Law School, said, Presidents want sitting judges with impeccable credentials, and these two schools count. In other words, presidents want their nominees to get through the often contentious nomination process, and it may be an easier sell if the nominee went to a brand-name law school.

Compared to educational diversity, geographic diversity is harder to find. More than half of circuit court judges (54 percent) hail from the East or West Coast.

Looking for judges who satisfy both categories narrows the pool considerably. Only 54 circuit court judges neither attended Harvard nor Yale Law School nor grew up on a coast. But not all of those people are plausible Obama nominees. When I ignore those who were not nominated to their current posts by other Democratic presidents, Im left with a pool of 29 judges.

Even that includes some people Obama will probably never consider. Obama wouldnt be likely to pick the two judges in their 80s who match my criteria, and if hes looking for someone under 60, he only has 11 circuit court judges to pick from. As the pool gets shallower and shallower, you can see how difficult it can be to shake up the courts demographics.

And I still havent touched Scalias last criterion: Finding any kind of Protestant to add to the exclusively Jewish and Catholic court. But data on the religion of sitting judges is difficult to come by. I called two of the 12 circuit courts, and both their court officers declined to comment on judges faith.

Even if Scalia intended his indictment of the homogenous court primarily to ridicule his colleagues, Jonathan Kastellec, an assistant professor at Princeton University, told me that changing the composition of the court really could change its decisions. In his own research, hes found that not only do African-American judges differ in how they rule compared to judges of other races, but also that their presence makes a difference. Their colleagues vote differently when serving in a racially mixed group compared to an all-white one. Other researchers have observed similar effects on male judges who serve with women, rather than with all men.

If adding judges from a broader range of faiths, schools and hometowns did shift the courts decisions, Scalia wouldnt have seen it as a victory for diversity, though. He would have viewed it as damning evidence that his colleagues were deciding cases on something other than what the Constitutions creators intended. If he could influence the nomination process at all, hed probably repeat what hed said before: If he couldnt have someone who agreed with him, he just wanted someone smart.","['definition', 'colleagues', 'law', 'diversity', 'circuit', 'scalias', 'court', 'judges', 'picks', 'courts', 'scalia', 'meet', 'yale', 'whomever', 'supreme', 'obama']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 13:18:17+00:00,Rubio And Cruz Need The Mormon Vote In Nevada,['Clare Malone'],"NORTH LAS VEGAS  The people lined up on stage waiting for Marco Rubio to arrive at the Texas Station casino in North Las Vegas on Sunday night looked like a phalanx of soldiers dressed by Mens Wearhouse, and the Florida senator liked the way they looked up there, I guarantee it.

The assembled were the living, breathing references section on Rubios resume, personifications of the steady stream of endorsements that keep coming in for him  despite his perpetual second place-ness to Donald Trump  now that Jeb Bush has departed. Before the candidate took the stage, speakers included a senator, a congressman, a Pawn Stars star and a former New Kid on the Block (hint: the Wahlberg thats not Mark); all were marshaled to and from the mic by an energetic man in rimless glasses with sandy-blond hair, Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison.

Hutchison is, among other things, the chair of Rubios Nevada campaign and a prominent member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These two facts are not unimportant in the context of todays Republican caucuses in Nevada. Mormons are only 4 percent of Nevadas population, but they have exercised outsize influence in the states past two caucuses, accounting for 25 percent of Republican participants in 2012 and 26 percent in 2008; Mitt Romney, Americas most famous Mormon, won their vote by 88 and 95 percent, respectively.

But there is no Romney on the ticket in 2016, meaning the Mormon vote is seen as a prize among the Republican candidates, with Rubio and Ted Cruz each making gambits. The same night Rubio stumped amid the slot machines, Cruz was introduced at a rally in Henderson, Nevada, by radio personality Glenn Beck, who got a cheer from the crowd when he said he was Mormon. Well thats a very different reaction, he said.

The Mormon community makes up a small slice of the electoral pie, but their reach is significant, according to Quin Monson, a political scientist at Brigham Young University who has studied the communitys voting habits. In caucus situations where its a little more effort and civic responsibility and organizing ability, this is where the Mormons can be particularly effective, he said.

Caucuses involve standing up and stumping for a candidate, and that, said David Campbell, a political scientist at Notre Dame and Monsons co-author, is a natural fit for members of the LDS Church. Mormons as a group are very comfortable with public speaking; thats a regular part of the faith, he said, citing the rotating talks given at weekly church sermons by members of the congregation. The mission experience just kind of ramps that up, Campbell added. Youve either spent 18 months or two years of your life approaching complete strangers.

In 1960, John F. Kennedy won close to 80 percent of the Catholic vote in his race against Richard Nixon, according to estimates. By the time 1972 rolled around, Nixon won 52 percent Catholics. The world changed in those 12 years, and Catholics went from being identity-politics voters to those grappling with the issues-based implications of their faith in public life. While Mormons are overwhelmingly Republican, they are generally not knee-jerk party-liners, according to Monson, who called them conservative with a twist. Campbell noted that time spent overseas doing mission work means Mormons as a group are actually more cosmopolitan than you might think. That makes whatever way their vote swings this election an object of certain fascination.

There isnt polling data that tells us which way Mormons might be leaning in this years Republican primary, but thanks to Trumps something-there-is-that-doesnt-love-a-wall campaign, hard-line rhetoric on immigration and refugees has become something of a staple in this campaign, and Mormons hold nuanced views on immigration. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is concerned that any state legislation that only contains enforcement provisions is likely to fall short of the high moral standard of treating each other as children of God, a 2011 statement from the Mormon Church read. The Church supports an approach where undocumented immigrants are allowed to square themselves with the law and continue to work without this necessarily leading to citizenship.

This stance is reflected by split Mormon public opinion on immigration. A Pew survey published in 2012 showed that 45 percent of LDS Church members thought immigrants strengthened the country and 41 percent said they were a burden. This tracks with the publics views on immigration, but not Republicans; according to a 2015 Pew survey, 43 percent of Republicans were more likely to vote for a candidate who would deport all illegal immigrants. In October, in the midst of the Syrian refugee crisis, the Church released a letter expressing support for those fleeing. It didnt mention Trump by name, the Church is very careful, Monson said. But the timing was unmistakable. Harassed and misunderstood for over a century  their founding father was killed by an angry mob, after all  Mormons are acutely sensitive to the plight of the outsider.

Rubios past attempts at immigration reform could make him a favorite with Mormons, but Cruzs ardent Constitutionalism is a boon in the LDS community as well; it is a theological tenet of the religion that the Constitution was divinely inspired. You will often find Mormons talking about the Constitution in very reverential terms, Campbell said. Thats why the term Constitutional conservative resonates so well. (Utah Sen. Mike Lee, also a Mormon, has built a career on this foundation.)

Rubio himself went to a Mormon church for a time when his family lived in Nevada. While he didnt explicitly bring that up at the Sunday night rally, he did spend an inordinate amount of time (for a stump speech) pointing out how many family members were present and detailing the Las Vegas chapter of his life. Id never seen mountains before, and they looked like cardboard cutouts, he said of getting off the plane from Miami. My skin had never been so dry.

The establishment on the stage behind him laughed politely. At about the same time, Mitt Romney started trending on Facebook: Rumors were flying that Americas most famous Mormon would soon endorse Rubio.","['republican', 'mormon', 'rubio', 'immigration', 'mormons', 'need', 'cruz', 'members', 'church', 'vote', 'nevada', 'thats']"
fivethirtyeight,2016-02-21 02:48:34+00:00,Jeb Bushs Path To Defeat Began A Year Ago,['Harry Enten'],"The Jeb Bush campaign for president is over. After a disappointing finish in South Carolina on Saturday, he suspended his campaign shortly before 9 p.m., before it was even clear whether he would place fourth or fifth. The news of his exit didnt come as a surprise given his poor showings in the first three contests this primary season, but if you had told most analysts a year ago how the Bush campaign would go, they would have been shocked. So just what the heck happened?

1. The party didnt decide on Bush

The first indication that Bush was going to have some problems came almost a year ago, when prominent members of the Republican Party didnt rally around his cause. My colleague Nate Silver and I first wrote about this in April 2015. Bushs pace of endorsements was, at that point, far behind that of his brother George W. Bush in 2000, and behind that of other campaigns that romped to victory. Although he picked up a few more endorsements by the time he officially announced his bid in June 2015, it was clear Bush was facing a major problem.

Had the party leaders decided on Bush early, he may have been able to overcome some of his other weaknesses, such as relatively low poll numbers. Intra-party support may have forced other candidates from the field. Instead, the 2016 campaign saw a record number of candidates enter. Several of these candidates appealed to a similar set of voters as Bush (more on this in a moment) and gobbled up press attention. Even with millions of dollars raised by his campaign and super PAC, Bush was merely one of many.

2. Kasich did it better

For all of Bushs early problems, primary campaigns are about winning and building momentum, and Bush had a chance to come in second in New Hampshire and potentially restart his campaign  even after finishing well behind in Iowa. Marco Rubio had an awful debate performance on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, and New Hampshire has historically been willing to give more moderate candidates a boost. Bush, though, could only manage fourth, and so didnt get a bounce out of the Granite State.

Instead, it was John Kasich who won second place. Like Bush, Kasich held many events in New Hampshire. Like Bush, Kasich tried to run a policy-oriented campaign. Like Bush, Kasich pointed to his accomplishments as governor of a swing state. Unlike Bush, Kasich seemed content to allow the other candidates to quibble with each other on the debate stage, while he stayed positive. Thanks to his relatively strong performance in New Hampshire, Kasich now leads Bush nationally.

The upsetting thing for Bush is that Kasich entered the race very late and only after it became clear GOP elites werent coalescing behind Bush. A race with Donald Trump but without Kasich may have looked a lot different in New Hampshire. Indeed, if you add Bush and Kasichs New Hampshire vote percentage to that of fellow New Hampshire-centric candidate Chris Christie, you get 34 percent, or just a little less than Trumps 35 percent. That would have made for a very different storyline for Bush.

3. Voters wanted something fresh

Weve known for a long time that this years Republican electorate is fed up with the way the country has been run. Many more Americans say the country is on the wrong track than heading in the right direction. And this year, voters are making their voices heard. You can even see that on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton, who started off in a much stronger position than Bush, has had her hands full with Bernie Sanders (who wasnt even a Democrat until very recently).

On the Republican side, all of the leading candidates are fresh political faces. First-term Sen. Ted Cruz vanquished Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in Iowa. First-term Sen. Marco Rubio has had the most success within the endorsement primary and among mainstream conservatives, even as he fought against three politically savvy current and former governors. Oh, and theres also that guy named Donald Trump, who has dominated the Republican landscape. Even political novice Ben Carson has been able to stick around.

The bottom line is that Bush, the son of one president and brother of another, and a veteran office-holder himself a decade ago, was the wrong fit for this political atmosphere.

4. Trump

Lets be real: Trump upended the 2016 campaign, and Bush was his most prominent casualty. While Trump has attacked almost everybody, his biggest early target was Bush. As my colleague Allison McCann found in late August 2015, Bush was attacked more times on Twitter by Trump than all of the other candidates combined. Trump seemed to delight even in attacking Bushs mother. And he had defied party orthodoxy by savaging George W. Bush for not preventing the Sept. 11 attacks, and for misleading the country into war with Iraq.

Whether or not Republicans love Trump (and many dont, particularly the strongest economic and foreign policy conservatives), he garnered more media attention than anybody else. That meant the negative information flow directed against Bush was staggering. While candidates like Cruz, Kasich and Rubio stayed out of the firing line in the beginning, Bush was hit over and over. That pushed Bushs poll numbers downward, and he never recovered. Bushs support nationally was cut in half, from 12 percent on June 1 of last year to just 6 percent now, which is good enough for dead last. Bush is the only candidate left in the race who is polling more than a percentage point lower now than on June 1 of last year. Trump, meanwhile, is polling over 30 percentage points higher.

5. Voters just werent that into Bush

Whatever the reason that other candidates rose or faded, Bush had one big problem at the end of the day: Voters didnt like him. You can see this in the chart below, which shows a three-poll rolling average of Bushs net favorability rating among Republicans, according to YouGov, since Bush entered the campaign.

Bushs net favorability in the latest three-polling average is just +5 percentage points, which is down 25 percentage points from when Bush announced his bid. Its very difficult to win a partys nomination when the number of party members who dont like you is nearly equal to the number that do like you.","['ago', 'party', 'trump', 'campaign', 'voters', 'began', 'kasich', 'hampshire', 'jeb', 'bush', 'bushs', 'defeat', 'path', 'percentage', 'candidates']"

Labrador retrievers are Americas best best friends. The breed took the top spot on the most popular list last year, according to registrations with the American Kennel Club. It was the 25th consecutive year of their reign. Only four other breeds  the Boston terrier, the beagle, the poodle and the cocker spaniel  have held the most-popular distinction since 1935.

37 films

Leonardo DiCaprio, who appears to be on his way to receiving his first Oscar on Sunday, has appeared in 37 films over 24 years. The standard lines on Leo have often been its about time, he deserves it, just give him the statue already, and so on. But my colleague Walt Hickey found that, if Leo wins, hell have had just the 33rd most successful pre-Oscar career of 90 winners tracked. [FiveThirtyEight]

40 percent

Single women voters will be hugely important this cycle, Rebecca Traister argued. Their numbers are growing, bringing massive social and political implications. In 2012, unmarried women were 23 percent of the electorate, and for the first time its expected that a majority of women voters will be unmarried. However, last presidential election cycle, 40 percent of single women had not registered to vote. This is partly because of the very obstacles that single women need social policy to account for, Traister wrote. [The Cut]

15,000 houses

Speaking of Starbucks, in one of lifes small but surprising victories, it turns out there are more historic house museums in the U.S. than there are Starbucks locations. There are 15,000 such museums, like the former home of Edgar Allen Poe in the Bronx. Theres only one problem: Way more people visit Starbucks than the museums. More than half of the historic house museums receive fewer than 15 visitors per day. Take that grande soy latte to go and visit a famous persons birthplace, would you? [Urban Omnibus]

$3 million

Marlene Ricketts, of the billionaire Ricketts family that owns the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs, donated $3 million to a super PAC devoted to derailing the presidential run of Donald Trump.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-22 20:43:19+00:00,Hollywoods Diversity Problem Goes Deeper Than The Oscars,['Ella Koeze'],"There was widespread criticism of the film industry last month after an all-white slate of actors and actresses was nominated for the Academy Awards, spawning the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite. However, a new study shows that awards are just a symptom of Hollywoods lack of diversity.

The study, conducted by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern Californias Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, evaluated the diversity of gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity in hundreds of films and TV series released in 2014 and 2015.

Weve previously documented the Annenberg Schools examination of gender diversity, but its findings on racial diversity in Hollywood are just as stark. In the chart below, you can see that nonwhite on-screen representation is well below U.S. population levels, and its even worse for directors. The study also broke down its findings into categories of film, broadcast, streaming and cable, all of which are almost equally white and are often considered a training ground for the silver screen.","['hollywoods', 'annenberg', 'diversity', 'deeper', 'findings', 'gender', 'study', 'white', 'oscars', 'awards', 'goes', 'problem', 'widespread', 'film', 'worse']"

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 10:38:50+00:00,Nevada May Show Trump Can Win Even With Low Turnout,['Nate Silver'],"So far, the higher the turnout, the better Donald Trump has done:

In Iowa, about 8 percent of the voting-eligible population participated in the Republican caucuses, according to a calculation by Dr. Michael McDonald. Trump won 24 percent of the vote.

In South Carolina, 20 percent of the voting-eligible population voted in the Republican primary on Saturday. Trump won 33 percent of the vote.

In New Hampshire, 27 percent of the voting-eligible population participated in the GOP primary. Trump won 35 percent.

Is this a coincidence? Probably, at least in part; its hard to make very much out of three data points, and there are several conflating variables. For instance, theres been evidence for a long time that Trump is more popular in both the Northeast and the South than in the Midwest. Also, several candidates dropped out after Iowa and several more still after New Hampshire; even if Trump is picking up less of that support than other candidates, that still helps him some.

Nonetheless, if youre Ted Cruz, this might give you some explanation for why you beat Trump by 3 percentage points in Iowa but lost to him by 10 points in South Carolina. Even though Republican turnout hit a record high in Iowa, it was still much lower than it would be in a typical primary, since caucuses discourage participation and disenfranchise voters. Cruzs ground game had more opportunity to make a difference in Iowa, and Trump had less of an opportunity to benefit from irregular voters who might show up for Trump but wouldnt typically participate in a GOP nomination contest.

Well get much more evidence on the importance of turnout over the next few weeks, starting today when Nevada holds its caucuses. In 2012, according to estimates from McDonald, only 1.9 percent of the voting-eligible population  about 33,000 people  participated in the Republican caucuses in Nevada. Thats tiny: About a third of what turnout was in Iowa in 2012 and less than a tenth of what it was in New Hampshire.

DATE STATE TYPE REPUBLICAN TURNOUT (2012) Jan. 3 Iowa Caucus 5.4% Jan. 10 New Hampshire Primary 24.9 Jan. 21 South Carolina Primary 17.6 Jan. 31 Florida Primary 12.8 Feb. 4 Nevada Caucus 1.9 Feb. 4-11 Maine Caucus 0.6 Feb. 7 Colorado Caucus 1.8 Minnesota Caucus 1.3 Feb. 28 Arizona Primary 11.9 Michigan Primary 13.8 Mar. 3 Washington Caucus 1.1 Mar. 6 Alaska Caucus 2.8 Georgia Primary 13.7 Idaho Caucus 4.1 Massachusetts Primary 7.8 North Dakota Caucus 2.2 Ohio Primary 14.1 Oklahoma Primary 10.5 Tennessee Primary 11.7 Vermont Primary 12.4 Virginia Primary 4.6 Mar. 6-10 Wyoming Caucus 0.3 Mar. 10 Kansas Caucus 1.5 Mar. 13 Alabama Primary 17.7 Hawaii Caucus 1.0 Mississippi Primary 13.6 Mar. 20 Illinois Primary 10.5 Mar. 24 Louisiana Primary 5.6 Apr. 3 District of Columbia Primary 1.1 Maryland Primary 6.1 Wisconsin Primary 18.7 Republican turnout varied radically in 2012 Turnout estimates reflect share of voting-eligible population. Source: electproject.org

The reason Nevada is such an interesting test case is because it otherwise looks like a really good state for Trump. Recent Nevada polls have Trump way ahead, with about 40 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the polling firm Morning Consult, which has been conducting polls throughout the Republican nomination contest, has had Nevada as one of Trumps best states. Hes polled at 48 percent among respondents in Nevada since the summer, according to Morning Consult, well ahead of his national average of 36 percent and tied for his second-best performance in any state. (Interestingly, the West is generally not a great region for Trump in Morning Consult or other polling. But Nevada  with its glitzy hotels, casinos, East Coast transplants and retiree population  seems to be a big exception.)

But those polls may have trouble identifying the tiny fraction of Nevadans who will show up at the caucuses today. In 2008, a CNN poll released two days before the Nevada caucuses had John McCain winning with 29 percent of the vote, followed by Mike Huckabee at 20 percent and Mitt Romney at 19 percent. The actual results? Romney 51 percent, with McCain in third with just 13 percent (behind Ron Paul and ahead of Huckabee). Thats about the least accurate poll Ive ever seen. But, with voter participation in Nevada as low as it is, we should be sympathetic to the pollsters; theyre essentially looking for needles in haystacks.

So if Trump gets 40-something percent of the vote in Nevada, in line with the polls, that will be a sign that turnout might not be such a problem for him. Iowa, where the campaigns are much better organized than anywhere else, will appear to be more of a one-off fluke.

If Trump is in the 20s or low 30s instead  and certainly if he loses Nevada  that will suggest there are openings for Cruz and Marco Rubio later in the calendar. Certainly these opportunities would include the other caucus states, but to a lesser extent, they might include other primary states, too, where turnout usually isnt quite as high as in New Hampshire and South Carolina.

With 794 games, more than 152,000 possessions and some 372,000 plays, probably not, but weve given it a shot. What you see above is the 2014-15 seasons win probabilities, summarized. At any point in an NBA game, each team has a probability of winning based on the time remaining, the score and the situation (i.e. after a made shot, shooting foul, etc.). In the chart, each teams in-game win probability is averaged over each minute of regulation time. Its like watching a win-loss record develop in real time.

The win probability model that provides the foundation of the chart uses data from 13 NBA seasons (2000 to 2012). The model is not based on simulations, but rather it does its best to reflect how NBA games are actually played, won and lost.

One of our favorite findings: The Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks share a similar win-loss record, but theyve taken different paths to get to that point. The Warriors have shown more dominance throughout games, often building early, insurmountable leads. The Hawks, in contrast, dont pull away until the fourth quarter.

fivethirtyeight,2016-02-23 18:44:41+00:00,Ted Cruzs General Election Strategy Is Wishful Thinking,['Dan Hopkins'],"Even after a third-place showing in South Carolina on Saturday, Ted Cruz is one of three Republican presidential candidates  along with Donald Trump and Marco Rubio  who still has a relatively straightforward path to the nomination. But by nominating someone who is among the most conservative members of the Senate (and is perceived as such), would the GOP be setting itself up for defeat in November?

For the Cruz team, the answer is a clear no. Cruz staffers argue that they can win by prioritizing mobilizing the conservative base over appealing to swing voters. In their telling, Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign targeted chimerical swing voters and missed the true prize: conservatives. As Eliana Johnson reports in National Review, Cruz and his team have talked endlessly about the power of these missing conservative voters, and their theory remains the subject of considerable skepticism in the political class. Count me among the skeptics.

There is a logic underpinning the base-focused strategy. In a polarized age, there simply arent many swing voters up for grabs, and each party has a large and reliable base with millions of voters whose main choice is whether or not to go to the polls. A recent article by political scientist Corwin Smidt confirms the endangered status of contemporary swing voters.

Still, whether candidates can win by focusing on base voters depends on their relative capacity to mobilize their base and to persuade undecideds. And thanks to math, persuasion has a built-in advantage over mobilization in two-party contests: When you persuade a voter, you reduce an opponents vote total while increasing your own. When you mobilize a voter who would never have backed the opposition, you add a vote to your own tally without touching your opponents.

Even with that math, its in some ways a false choice. Campaigns almost always engage in both persuasion and mobilization. But Team Cruzs critique of the Romney campaign  and of the GOP establishment  is that it should have put more stock in mobilizing conservatives. In part, they point to John Sides and Lynn Vavrecks data showing that voters in 2012 saw Romney as closer to them ideologically than Obama. In this view, to pursue base voters is simply to follow Obamas 2012 road to victory.

To justify a base strategy, the Cruz camp also seems to draw on RealClearPolitics analyst Sean Trendes argument that 2012 saw a drop-off in voting by non-Hispanic whites. That echoes Rush Limbaughs post-election take as to why Romney lost: My best guess at what happened was, why the white vote stayed home, they didnt think the Republican Party was conservative enough. As Trende notes, though, it is one thing to say that whites stayed home, and quite another to say that conservative whites stayed home. And thats an empirical question, so lets go to the data.

One way to determine whether demobilized conservatives cost Romney the 2012 election is to look at the Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics panel that Diana Mutz and I have been conducting with other colleagues. The nationally representative panel allows us to observe the same Americans from the 2008 primaries to the 2016 primaries. The data includes respondents vote histories, so we can look at how turnout varies by ideology and election year.

In the chart below, I plotted the share of respondents who voted in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 general elections (y-axis) by their self-reported 2008 ideology (x-axis). Ideology is reported on a seven-point scale, from extremely liberal (1) to extremely conservative (7). Each dot shows the average turnout. The vertical bars show 90 percent confidence intervals. They are much wider at the ends of the spectrum, because there are relatively few extreme liberals and conservatives in the survey. Consistent with other research, there are more respondents who are conservative than who are liberal.

Lets start with the left panel, which plots the ideology-turnout relationship in 2008, when John McCain ran against Barack Obama. In general, we see the expected U-shaped pattern: Just like people who dont care much about the outcome of a baseball game are less likely to go, people who are more moderate ideologically are less likely to vote. As Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler show in a recent book, perceiving that the parties differ is a motivation to turn out. The 3 percent of the sample who identify as extremely conservative do appear to vote at a lower rate than other conservatives, but the sample size is so small that we are very uncertain about the precise estimate.

In 2010, the tea party midterm, the results look a bit different  the traditional U shape is skewed, with conservatives showing markedly higher mobilization than liberals. For conservatives, the first two years of the Obama presidency were powerfully mobilizing. Even though 2010 was a midterm year, overall turnout dropped in this sample by just 8 percentage points, and among conservatives, it was down just 3 percentage points.

In 2012, the U shape becomes more symmetrical. But notice that turnout among the 19 percent of respondents who deem themselves conservative is 80 percent, which is notably higher than the 74 percent notched by liberals. Overall, it seems plausible that McCains nomination in 2008 kept some conservatives home, but there is no such evidence for Romney in 2012.

Another way to approach this question is to look at the geography of voter turnout. I focus on Iowa for two reasons. For one, its first-in-the-nation status gives us an unusually clear picture of where support for conservative candidates lies. In 2012, the Iowa GOP caucuses were so close that former Sen. Rick Santorums tight victory over Romney wasnt clear for days. Whats more, Iowa was a heavily contested swing state in the general election, meaning that both the Romney and Obama teams worked hard to mobilize voters there.

The chart plots the share that right-leaning candidates won in the caucuses on the x-axis and shows each countys general-election turnout on the y-axis. Each dot represents a county. As it makes clear, there isnt a strong relationship between the counties where support for conservative candidates  Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich  was higher and low voter turnout. In fact, accounting for the counties total number of GOP caucus voters, turnout was higher in the places where right-leaning candidates did better. That relationship holds even if we deem only Santorum and Bachmann to be right-leaning. The survey evidence doesnt back up the base-focused strategy, and neither do election returns.

Of course, the attraction of the turn-out-the-base strategy isnt just about winning in November. The base strategy also has another appeal: It denies that there is any trade-off between taking more extreme positions and competing in a general election. In that, it provides cover for activists on both sides to push the policies theyd like to see. So it is a powerful strategy to justify stances that arent in line with the median voter. Its just not as compelling in actually winning elections.
