Last time we checked in on Golden States run to 73 was back in December, when the model gave the Warriors a 54 percent chance of getting at least 72 wins and a 44.1 percent chance of at least 73. A little more than two months later, the Warriors are 48-4 and those chances are 69.8 percent to hit 72 and an even 54 percent to reach 73. From where we sit, at least, the Warriors now appear likely to break the 96 Bulls record.

WINS SIMS CHANCE OF EXACTLY THIS MANY WINS CHANCE OF AT LEAST THIS MANY WINS 59 1 <0.1% 100.0% 60 1 <0.1 >99.9 61 1 <0.1 >99.9 62 5 <0.1 >99.9 63 21 <0.1 >99.9 64 53 0.1 99.9 65 138 0.3 99.8 66 314 0.6 99.6 67 634 1.3 98.9 68 1368 2.7 97.7 69 2585 5.2 94.9 70 4008 8.0 89.8 71 5996 12.0 81.7 72 7857 15.7 69.8 73 8559 17.1 54.0 74 8031 16.1 36.9 75 5754 11.5 20.9 76 3207 6.4 9.3 77 1224 2.5 2.9 78 243 0.5 0.5 50,000 CARM-Elo simulations of the Warriors season with data through Feb. 18

Our colleagues at ESPN Stats & Info once again have a less optimistic outlook, today giving the Warriors a 37 percent chance of hitting 73 or more wins. The explanation for the difference in the two models is the same as it was in December, when we were also more bullish than our colleagues: We devised a different rating system, called CARM-Elo, which allows good (or bad) runs of play in the simulations to inform a teams simulated strength through the rest of the simulated season. Basically, this means that it allows for extreme performance to be reflected in the results, and the Warriors are certainly extreme.

Still, all of the back-and-forth over exactly how good the Warriors are is more than a little backward. Any serious debate over whether Golden State is an all-time team dried up months ago; all thats left now is the dreary accounting of decimal points next to the teams name. Screw that. NBA nerds slapfighting over some grandiose meaning of the Warriors is boring  its the spectacle that matters, the crossovers and no-looks and nonsense transition threes, and how those feats of skill translate to the stat sheet. That in mind, heres a bunch of Warriors facts aimed at appreciating the wild mess theyre accomplishing this season, rather than simply measuring it.

The Warriors would have to miss their next 545 3-pointers to bring their team mark of 42.4 percent down to the level of the league-worst Lakers, at 31.5 percent.

If the Warriors completely gave up the 3-pointer and shot none of them per game from this point forward, the Timberwolves, who take the fewest threes per game, would need 50 games to catch up in attempts and 83 games to catch up in makes, pulling even right around the 137th game of the season.

In order to match the best 3-point-percentage season of Reggie Millers career (42.9 percent), Steph Curry (45.4 percent from three on 10.8 per game) would have to miss 31 straight threes; to match Larry Birds best (42.7 percent) hed need to miss 34 straight; to match LeBrons mark this season (27.4 percent) he would have to miss 354 straight 3-point shots.

Currys 646 3-point attempts last season were more than those Miller and Bird seasons combined  and hes on pace to demolish that number this year.

This foolishness:

Remember that two-month stretch in the summer of 2009 when Steph Curry might have gone to the Knicks, before Donnie Walsh and Mike DAntoni went around telling anyone who would stand still long enough to hear it exactly why Curry would be a superstar? And remember how disappointing it was, then, when Curry landed on a Warriors team that didnt use him at all in the way fans dreamed he might be used by the Pringles stache? Well, Curry found his way into the seven-seconds-or-less offense anyway. By NBA.coms count (which can lag a game or two behind), the Warriors have taken 299 threes in the first seven seconds of the shot clock and made 48.5 percent of them. The next closest by percentage is Indiana, at 42.5 on 167 attempts; Houston, first in attempts with 301 (in four more games than Golden State) has made 38.9 percent of its own; and the Thunder have found a way to make just 31.6 percent on 171 attempts. On all field goals in the seven-seconds-or-less window, the Warriors have a 68 percent effective field-goal percentage  the next closest is the Cavs, at 63.4 percent. The Knicks, meanwhile, are last in the league at 51.4 percent.

The Warriors are shooting 46.3 percent from three on wide open (defender more than 6 feet away) threes, best in the league. They also lead the league in open threes at 41 percent and tight coverage threes at 37.3 percent. They do fall to fourth in very tight threes (36.1 percent) but have taken only 36 of those all season.

Steph Curry is 11 for 24 on threes from 30 feet or more, according to nbawowy.com. Six of those shots (and one of the makes) were from beyond half court, meaning hes 10 for 18 between 30 feet and the center line. (The rest of the Warriors are 1 for 14 from 30-plus.) Consider this a reminder that Ben Morris dug into Stephs imperious shot selection in December.

(While were digging out old charts, get a load of Draymond in these.)

Oh, heres a scatter plot of 3-point attempts vs. 3-point percentage since the 1979-80 season, the first year of the 3-pointer:

The Warriors create 70.4 points per game through assists. The rest of the league has a fairly linear progression from the bottom on up  the Lakers are the worst, at 43.2, and the figure creeps up team by team until it stops with the Hawks, in second place, at 60.3. That isnt adjusted for tempo (the Warriors play at the second-fastest pace in the league), but the Dubs are also comfortably in first in percentage of passes that are assists, are secondary assists or lead to free throws.

According to nbaminer.com, Curry has scored 10 straight points for his team 10 times, the most in the league (James Harden is second with nine); hes scored 15 straight team points three times (Harden is second again, two) and 20 straight once (only Paul George has also done that this season). Curry has scored five straight unanswered points 55 times (Harden is second with 47, followed by George and Klay Thompson at 30).

points 55 times (Harden is second with 47, followed by George and Klay Thompson at 30). Probably the most alarming thing about the Warriors this season is how thoroughly they are outpacing the Spurs, another omega-level team stalking around the league. Also according to nbaminer.com, the Warriors average first-quarter margin is +6.04. The Spurs are second at +2.98. The Spurs remain ahead of the Warriors on the overall marks, +12.7 to +12.5, but this difference is more than accounted for in the fourth quarter, where the Warriors are -0.12 and the Spurs are an NBA-best +2.56. The Warriors average margin per overtime period is +4.0, best in the league.

And heres the same display of possible records we generated for the Warriors above, but for the Spurs.","[]"

"3","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-18 19:24:13+00:00","Marco Rubios Paid Family Leave Plan May Not Work","['Andrew Flowers']","Paid family leave is having a moment. Democrats and now some Republicans, including presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, want to give more workers the opportunity to take time off to care for a new baby or an ailing relative, all while still collecting a paycheck. Yet conservatives face a conundrum: how to expand paid leave without raising taxes or stipulating new regulations. Rubios plan avoids doing so, but at a cost  policy experts say it might not expand paid family leave all that much.

Currently, the United States is an extreme international outlier on lack of paid family leave and is the only Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development country not to mandate paid maternity leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, gives employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child or a sick family member. Only 13 percent of workers at private companies get paid family leave as a benefit from their employer.

Rubios paid family leave plan has been touted as the first of its kind for a GOP presidential candidate, which makes it significant on its own. The fact that you have a Republican presidential candidate talking about paid family leave is important. It says that there is a widespread recognition of its importance, said Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of Virginia and an expert in the economic effects of paid family leave policies.

A majority (67 percent) of American adults support paid time off for workers after the birth of a child, according to an AP-GfK poll conducted last year. Although Democrats are most enthusiastic (with 82 percent in favor), majorities of both Republicans and independents support paid leave, too.

A New York Times/CBS News poll released in June 2015 found similar bipartisan support: 88 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of Republicans favored requiring employers to offer paid leave to parents of new children and employees caring for sick family members.

If you actually talk to voters, this is not a partisan issue  it polls extremely well across partisan lines, said Sarah Jane Glynn, director of womens economic policy at the Center for American Progress.

Of course, support for a policy in theory doesnt equate to support for a specific proposal or piece of legislation, and policymakers disagree on how to expand paid family leave. Most Democrats have rallied behind the stalled FAMILY Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. Under their plan, qualified workers would receive up to 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or ailing family member. When on leave, employees would receive 66 percent of their wages, up to about $1,500 per week. They would fund this benefit through a 0.4 percentage point increase in payroll taxes (split evenly between employee and employer) and would set up a separate Social Security-like trust fund to manage it.

The left-leaning Center for American Progress estimates that the FAMILY Act would make 77 percent to 84 percent of all U.S. workers eligible for paid leave; however, the economic effects stemming from higher payroll taxes, both on businesses and employees, are uncertain.

Sanders and Clinton largely agree with the benefits offered in the FAMILY Act, but Clinton disagrees on how to fund them. Clinton, who has pledged not to raise taxes on middle-class households, prefers a tax on wealthier Americans, rather than a broad-based payroll tax increase.

Republicans have their own favored bill: The Strong Families Act, sponsored by Sens. Deb Fischer and Angus King. Rubios plan, which grants nonrefundable tax credits to employers that offer paid family leave, is largely modeled off it.

In a speech unveiling the plan in September at the Values Voter Summit, a gathering of social conservatives, Rubio was clear: his plan would not be a mandate on businesses. Instead, he proposes an employer tax incentive, or a subsidy to encourage businesses to offer paid leave to their employees. Specifically, his plan would give companies a 25 percent nonrefundable tax credit for offering four to 12 weeks of paid leave. In theory, offsetting the cost to businesses for paid leave would push more companies to offer it.

But thats not how employer tax subsidies often work out. As with all tax-credit programs, at the margin it probably wont get most employers to change, said economist Aparna Mathur, who is affiliated with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. She was skeptical that Rubios plan would compel companies not already doing so to offer paid leave. For many tax incentives, most existing evidence indicates that companies would be doing it anyway, she said, pointing to the research and development tax credit (which lets businesses deduct R&D investments from their tax bill) as an example. In other words, Rubios plan might just subsidize companies that already offer paid family leave. Still, Mathur said it was a step in the right direction.

The Rubio campaign declined to respond specifically to criticism of his plans effectiveness, but communications director Alex Conant said, Marco is open to other proposals, so long as they do not raise taxes or create new mandates.

Syracuse economist Sarah Hamersma studied the effect of two tax credits initiated in the 1990s to encourage businesses to hire disadvantaged workers: the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and Welfare-to-Work credit. Her research concluded that those tax incentives were vastly underutilized and ineffective at encouraging hiring in the targeted groups.

Although her work is frequently cited by critics of Rubios proposal, Hamersma sees the policies as apples and oranges. The employer subsidies she studied were trying to get firms to hire certain people, and the paid family leave credits would be pushing for a more subtle behavioral change, she said; that is, the credits would apply to workers a firm has already hired (and hence pose no risk to the firms using the credit). But because the plan offers only a 25 percent credit, Id be surprised if it made a huge difference in increasing paid family leave coverage, she said.

Whether or not Rubios plan is effective at expanding paid family leave, both conservatives and progressives agree that paid family leave is becoming more popular among voters. Up until this point, paid family leave has been a Democratic issue, but going forward itll be a bipartisan issue, said W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist at the University of Virginia who is also affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.

Rubios proposal is not my favorite, the Center for American Progresss Glynn said, as it falls short of being comprehensive. But that hes talking about it at all reflects a real shift.

"4","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-21 02:48:34+00:00","Jeb Bushs Path To Defeat Began A Year Ago","['Harry Enten']","The Jeb Bush campaign for president is over. After a disappointing finish in South Carolina on Saturday, he suspended his campaign shortly before 9 p.m., before it was even clear whether he would place fourth or fifth. The news of his exit didnt come as a surprise given his poor showings in the first three contests this primary season, but if you had told most analysts a year ago how the Bush campaign would go, they would have been shocked. So just what the heck happened?

1. The party didnt decide on Bush

The first indication that Bush was going to have some problems came almost a year ago, when prominent members of the Republican Party didnt rally around his cause. My colleague Nate Silver and I first wrote about this in April 2015. Bushs pace of endorsements was, at that point, far behind that of his brother George W. Bush in 2000, and behind that of other campaigns that romped to victory. Although he picked up a few more endorsements by the time he officially announced his bid in June 2015, it was clear Bush was facing a major problem.

Had the party leaders decided on Bush early, he may have been able to overcome some of his other weaknesses, such as relatively low poll numbers. Intra-party support may have forced other candidates from the field. Instead, the 2016 campaign saw a record number of candidates enter. Several of these candidates appealed to a similar set of voters as Bush (more on this in a moment) and gobbled up press attention. Even with millions of dollars raised by his campaign and super PAC, Bush was merely one of many.

2. Kasich did it better

For all of Bushs early problems, primary campaigns are about winning and building momentum, and Bush had a chance to come in second in New Hampshire and potentially restart his campaign  even after finishing well behind in Iowa. Marco Rubio had an awful debate performance on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, and New Hampshire has historically been willing to give more moderate candidates a boost. Bush, though, could only manage fourth, and so didnt get a bounce out of the Granite State.

Instead, it was John Kasich who won second place. Like Bush, Kasich held many events in New Hampshire. Like Bush, Kasich tried to run a policy-oriented campaign. Like Bush, Kasich pointed to his accomplishments as governor of a swing state. Unlike Bush, Kasich seemed content to allow the other candidates to quibble with each other on the debate stage, while he stayed positive. Thanks to his relatively strong performance in New Hampshire, Kasich now leads Bush nationally.

The upsetting thing for Bush is that Kasich entered the race very late and only after it became clear GOP elites werent coalescing behind Bush. A race with Donald Trump but without Kasich may have looked a lot different in New Hampshire. Indeed, if you add Bush and Kasichs New Hampshire vote percentage to that of fellow New Hampshire-centric candidate Chris Christie, you get 34 percent, or just a little less than Trumps 35 percent. That would have made for a very different storyline for Bush.

3. Voters wanted something fresh

Weve known for a long time that this years Republican electorate is fed up with the way the country has been run. Many more Americans say the country is on the wrong track than heading in the right direction. And this year, voters are making their voices heard. You can even see that on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton, who started off in a much stronger position than Bush, has had her hands full with Bernie Sanders (who wasnt even a Democrat until very recently).

On the Republican side, all of the leading candidates are fresh political faces. First-term Sen. Ted Cruz vanquished Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in Iowa. First-term Sen. Marco Rubio has had the most success within the endorsement primary and among mainstream conservatives, even as he fought against three politically savvy current and former governors. Oh, and theres also that guy named Donald Trump, who has dominated the Republican landscape. Even political novice Ben Carson has been able to stick around.

The bottom line is that Bush, the son of one president and brother of another, and a veteran office-holder himself a decade ago, was the wrong fit for this political atmosphere.

4. Trump

Lets be real: Trump upended the 2016 campaign, and Bush was his most prominent casualty. While Trump has attacked almost everybody, his biggest early target was Bush. As my colleague Allison McCann found in late August 2015, Bush was attacked more times on Twitter by Trump than all of the other candidates combined. Trump seemed to delight even in attacking Bushs mother. And he had defied party orthodoxy by savaging George W. Bush for not preventing the Sept. 11 attacks, and for misleading the country into war with Iraq.

Whether or not Republicans love Trump (and many dont, particularly the strongest economic and foreign policy conservatives), he garnered more media attention than anybody else. That meant the negative information flow directed against Bush was staggering. While candidates like Cruz, Kasich and Rubio stayed out of the firing line in the beginning, Bush was hit over and over. That pushed Bushs poll numbers downward, and he never recovered. Bushs support nationally was cut in half, from 12 percent on June 1 of last year to just 6 percent now, which is good enough for dead last. Bush is the only candidate left in the race who is polling more than a percentage point lower now than on June 1 of last year. Trump, meanwhile, is polling over 30 percentage points higher.

5. Voters just werent that into Bush

Whatever the reason that other candidates rose or faded, Bush had one big problem at the end of the day: Voters didnt like him. You can see this in the chart below, which shows a three-poll rolling average of Bushs net favorability rating among Republicans, according to YouGov, since Bush entered the campaign.

Bushs net favorability in the latest three-polling average is just +5 percentage points, which is down 25 percentage points from when Bush announced his bid. Its very difficult to win a partys nomination when the number of party members who dont like you is nearly equal to the number that do like you.","[]"
"5","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-19 12:43:17+00:00","Ted Cruz Has A Huge Math Problem","['David Wasserman']","Ted Cruz may have a knack for the debate stage and a disciplined, data-driven campaign, but he may also have a huge viability problem.

Cruzs short-term dilemma has received plenty of attention: Donald Trump is on the verge of a big victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, according to most polls, and could easily capture all 50 of the Palmetto States delegates. And if Cruz cant beat Trump in South Carolina  a Southern state with a large proportion of evangelical and very conservative voters, Cruzs supposed bread and butter  what SEC Primary states can he win on Super Tuesday, March 1?

But Cruz also faces a longer-term, potentially more devastating math problem that has received less attention: The states that are his most natural fits  those with the highest proportions of evangelical voters  are also the least likely to award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. In other words, Cruzs votes may not translate into delegates nearly as efficiently as his rivals.

An examination of the GOP delegate landscape shows that in states where evangelical Protestants are at least 30 percent of the population, just 22 percent of delegates will be awarded on a winner-take-all basis, compared to 47 percent of delegates in other states:

This delegate allocation matrix puts Cruzs campaign at a serious disadvantage. For example, if Cruz wins the primary in his home state of Texas by one vote, hell probably win a handful more delegates than his nearest competitor. By contrast, if Marco Rubio or Trump win Florida by one vote, either would win a whopping 99 more delegates than his nearest competitor.

If you only count states that vote after South Carolina, the winner-take-all versus proportional gap gets even more daunting for Cruz. In fact, after South Carolina, the only winner-take-all states with a high proportion of evangelical Protestants are Indiana, Missouri and West Virginia  all of which are winner-take-all by congressional district.

These disparities could help explain why Cruzs position in betting markets remains very anemic  a good deal behind both Trump and Rubio  even though he is doing fairly well in the polls. Cruz ranks second in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of national polls, and the newest national NBC/Wall Street Journal survey shows him leading the GOP field for the first time at 28 percent, with 26 percent for Trump and 17 percent for Rubio.

Many pundits had initially predicted that Trump would fade, producing a Cruz-Rubio face-off for the nomination. But the cruel mathematical reality for Cruz could be hinting at a final showdown between Trump and Rubio, with Cruz and others potentially siphoning off enough delegates that neither Trump nor Rubio reach a majority of 2,472 delegates before the convention.

In fact, if Cruzs prospects are suddenly looking dimmer, the odds of a contested convention in Cleveland may be higher than ever.

"6","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-21 05:16:59+00:00","Trump Optimists And Trump Skeptics Are About To Go To War","['Nate Silver']","If you think the arguments between the Republican candidates have been bad, well, you aint seen nothing yet. Pundits, reporters and political analysts are going to really have at it. Two competing theories about the Republican race are about to come to a head, and both of them can claim a victory of sorts after South Carolina.

The first theory is simple. It can be summarized in one word: Trump! The more detailed version would argue the following:

Trump has easily won two of the first three states.

Trump is ahead in the polls in pretty much every remaining state.

Trump is ahead in delegates  in fact, he may win all 50 delegates from South Carolina.

Trump has been extremely resilient despite pundits constantly predicting his demise. Hes been at 35 percent in national polls for months now. Thats as steady as it gets!

So, um, isnt it obvious that Trump is going to be the Republican nominee?

Not so, say the Trump skeptics. Their case is pretty simple also:

Trump is winning states, but hes only getting about one-third of the vote.

Trump has a relatively low ceiling on his support.

Trump now has a chief rival: Florida senator Marco Rubio.

What did the Trump skeptics find to like about South Carolina? Quite a lot, actually. Theyd point out that Trump faded down the stretch run, getting 32 percent of the vote after initially polling at about 36 percent after New Hampshire, because of his continuing struggles with late-deciding voters. Theyd note that Trumps numbers worsened from New Hampshire to South Carolina despite several candidates having dropped out. Theyd say that Rubio, who went from 11 percent in South Carolina polls before Iowa to 22 percent of the vote on Saturday night, had a pretty good night. Theyd also say that Rubio will be helped by Jeb Bush dropping out, even if it had already become clear that Rubio was the preferred choice of Republican Party elites.

So what? sayeth the Trump optimists. Second place means youre a loser! Theres no guarantee that the other candidates will drop out any time soon. And as Trump himself has argued, its a mistake to assume that all of the support from Bush and other candidates will wind up in Rubios column. Some of it will go to Trump!

Indeed, other candidates remaining in the race are a big problem for Trump skeptics. Bush is gone, but John Kasich is still in, and he may hinder Rubio in states like Ohio. More importantly, Ted Cruz is still winning something like 20 percent of the Republican vote. Although Cruzs delegate math doesnt look good  his strongest states are those that allocate their delegates proportionally, whereas Rubio and Trump are variously strong in winner-take-all states  hell stay in the race through Super Tuesday and possibly for a lot longer.

Trump optimists other point is more of a straw man argument, however. The Trump skeptics arent presuming that Rubio will magically pick up all the support from Bush (and eventually, from Kasich and Cruz). Theyre looking at polls that have consistently shown Rubio picking up more second-choice support than Trump does. In some polls, thats enough for Rubio to tie or overtake Trump. In others it isnt. But virtually all polls have the race getting closer as the field winnows. Likewise, almost all polls (both state polls and national polls) show Rubio with higher favorability ratings than Trump.

I should note that the Trump skeptics find the Trump optimists a bit exasperating on this point. (Why are you talking about yourself in the third person, Nate?) The idea that Trump has a ceiling  or to be more precise, will encounter a lot of upward resistance as he seeks to gain more support  is not some type of special pleading. Instead, its a point the Trump skeptics have raised from the very earliest stages of Trumps campaign. And theyve seen some evidence to validate it from Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, along with recent polling.

A reasonable person might adjudicate the case as follows: Yes, if the Republican nomination becomes a two-man race between Trump and Rubio, it could be pretty close. But that might not happen, or it at least might not happen for a while, not until Trump is off to a pretty big head start in delegates. What happens in a three-way race between Trump, Rubio and Cruz is a little murky. This reasonable person would concede that Rubio had a chance. But whos the favorite? Trump!

The Trump skeptics might bring up one last line of argument. Theyd claim, perhaps more tentatively than they did before, that GOP elites still have some ability to influence the race. Maybe voters dont care about what the establishment thinks, but individual Republican politicians can still have some influence  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haleys endorsement of Rubio very probably helped him, for instance. These elites have quite a bit of money to throw around, especially with Bush out. They have some more subtle advantages: They can pack a debate hall with Rubio supporters, for instance. Or they could try to rule by brute force: If the Republican race goes to a contested convention, which is not at all unimaginable, were suddenly back in the pre-1972, smoke-filled-rooms era, although probably with delegates vaping instead of puffing on cigars.

Betting markets, weighing all of this information, see the Republican race thusly: Trump at about 50 percent to win the nomination, Rubio at 40 percent, and the rest of the field at 10 percent. I might quibble here and there, but that seems like basically a sound assessment. Now, lets get back to arguing on Twitter.","[]"

She won the Nevada caucuses by over 5 percentage points, an important margin in a state whose electorate was only 59 percent white. While there are still some questions about how Latinos voted, Clinton can claim tremendous support from black voters heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.

According to the entrance poll in Nevada, Clinton won black voters 76 percent to 22 percent. To put that in context, Clintons margin is only slightly smaller than Barack Obamas 83 percent to 14 percent win with black voters in the 2008 Nevada caucuses. While the result wasnt unexpected given that pre-election polls showed Clinton dominant with black voters, Sanders spent a lot of money on television in the state. That Sanders couldnt close the gap with black voters with a big advertising push is a very ominous sign for his campaign.

Many of the upcoming primaries will feature a much higher percentage of black voters than Nevada did. While only 13 percent of Nevada caucus-goers in 2016 were black, their share in South Carolina will be much higher (55 percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters were black in 2008). Thats why Clinton is up by 25 percentage points in the South Carolina polls. Even beyond South Carolina, on Super Tuesday 63 percent of the delegates up for grabs will be in contests with a higher share of African-Americans than Nevada. Better yet for Clinton, 35 percent of delegates will be up for grabs in contests with at least double the share of African-Americans as Nevada. In 2008, 19 percent of voters in all Democratic primaries were black  Clintons margin among black voters is a big advantage.

Thats not to say Nevada was all bad news for Sanders. Sanders has cut into Clintons advantage with Latino voters. In the 2008 Nevada caucuses, Clinton won Latinos 64 percent to 26 percent. This year, the entrance poll had Sanders winning Latinos 53 percent to 45 percent. Im a bit skeptical of those numbers, however, given that Clinton won in heavily Latino precincts in Las Vegas. The sample of Latino voters in the entrance poll was very small, a couple hundred respondents at most, so its possible those numbers are just off. (That said, David Shor of Civis Analytics argued that it is possible that Sanders won Latinos even as he did poorly in Latino neighborhoods because many younger Latinos  who are more likely to support Sanders  live in whiter neighborhoods.)

But whether he won them or not, Sanders was clearly competitive with Latinos, which really shouldnt be too surprising: A recent SurveyMonkey poll found Sanders closing the gap among Latinos to just 3 percentage points, and a NBC News/Telemundo survey put Clintons lead with Latino voters at 17 percentage points. Clinton isnt running away among Latinos. That could be good news for Sanders in states like Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Texas that vote in March. Still, Sanders is fighting an uphill battle given that many more March primaries have a large African-American electorate.

But in some ways Sanders has already won something: The Democratic electorate turning out in 2016 is more liberal than the one that turned out in the partys last competitive primary eight years ago. Democratic voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada this year were far more likely to describe themselves as liberal than they were in 2008. In Nevada, 70 percent of Democrats said they were liberal compared to just 45 percent in 2008. Sixty-eight percent of Democratic voters identified as liberal in Iowa and New Hampshire.

But even with a more liberal electorate, Clinton was able to carry the day. Nevada is likely to be the first in a string of victories for her campaign.","[]"

Before we get to the new puzzle, lets return to last weeks. Congratulations to  Guy D. Moore  of Darmstadt, Germany, our big winner. You can find a solution to the previous Riddler at the bottom of this post.

Now, heres this weeks Riddler, a take on a classic that captures the essence of one of my greatest phobias. Just reading it fills me with panic and dread. Enjoy!

Theres an airplane with 100 seats, and there are 100 ticketed passengers each with an assigned seat. They line up to board in some random order. However, the first person to board is the worst person alive, and just sits in a random seat, without even looking at his boarding pass. Each subsequent passenger sits in his or her own assigned seat if its empty, but sits in a random open seat if the assigned seat is occupied. What is the probability that you, the hundredth passenger to board, finds your seat unoccupied?

Extra credit: Its time to offer up a  Coolest Riddler Extension Award . Spice up this travel hellscape for your fellow readers. Change the size of the plane, the ticketing scheme, the boarding rules, or something far more creative than I can think of. Submit a description and analysis in the form below, or shoot me a link to your work on Twitter. Well publish a winner next week.

Need a hint? You can try asking me nicely. Want to submit a puzzle or problem? Email me.

And heres the solution to last weeks Riddler, concerning a dog on the hunt, a duck on the lam, and a circular pond. As I warned last week, this one is really tough. Only 3.1 percent of submissions were correct, a new record low. But I heartily applaud the effort. As every famous old person has been reported to have said, Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

The most commonly submitted answer, by far, was , the mathematical constant roughly equal to 3.14. That answer is wrong. Its correct if the duck follows a very simple strategy: make a beeline toward the shore opposite where the dog starts. In that case, the duck would have to cover a distance equal to the ponds radius to escape, but the dog would have to cover a distance equal to half the ponds circumference to catch it, which is  times farther.

But give the duck some credit! The duck can be far cleverer than that. The duck can escape a dog that is much faster  in fact, the duck can escape a dog that is about 4.6033 times faster than it!

The basic idea is that the duck should swim out from the center of the pond a bit, and start swimming in circles around the ponds center. Specifically, it should swim out a distance 1/4.6033 of the radius, and begin circling the center. The dogs only viable strategy is to follow the duck as closely as it can. Since the duck is swimming around in a smaller circle than the dog is running, the duck has the angular advantage, and the dog will fall behind. The math involved is first figuring out the ducks optimal small circle, and then figuring out when and in what direction the duck should ultimately bolt for the shore. The ducks optimal strategy will look roughly like this, cooked up by Friend of the RiddlerTM Zach Wissner-Gross:

Im going to spare you all the gnarly math details to arrive at that 4.6 number. For those who take pleasure in the gnarly details, see this thorough explanation at DataGenetics, or this one at Mathematical Recreations. (The first swaps a monster for the dog and a row boater for the duck, but otherwise the problems are the same.)

"9","fivethirtyeight","2014-10-16 16:33:09+00:00","The Playoff Implications Of Every Game For Every NFL Team","['Reuben Fischer-baum', 'Mike Beuoy']","Playoff Implications is a phrase you usually dont hear until the final weeks of the NFL regular season, but almost every regular season game has playoff implications. In the early going, however, it can be difficult to figure out just what those implications are, and how much is riding on each game.

Most other major sports leagues play a greater number of regular season games, and thus the playoff picture in those sports evolves in a more incremental fashion. The pace can seem glacial at times for MLB, and inevitable and foregone when it comes to the NBA. But with just 16 regular season games, the NFLs playoff landscape can change dramatically over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. And these tectonic shifts take place throughout the season, not just in those final weeks of December.

With a week or two left in the season, the eye test usually suffices for judging which games will shape the playoff picture. But in mid-October there are far too many possibilities for the unassisted human mind to make sense of. We can only speak in general terms. For example, we know the playoff chances for the New Orleans Saints will improve with a victory this Sunday over the Detroit Lions. But by how much? And how far would they drop with a loss? Expanding our focus, what other teams have a vested interest in the outcome of this game? One would expect Carolinas playoff chances to improve with a Saints loss, given that the Saints are their division rival. But once again, by how much?

To answer these questions, weve created a weekly feature that measures the playoff implications of each game. To do this, you need to be able to simulate the remainder of the season multiple times and analyze the results. And in order to simulate the season, you need a way to rank all 32 teams, and use that ranking to create outcome probabilities for future games. Weve been doing just that with FiveThirtyEights Elo rankings. But the Elo ratings, simple and beautiful, arent the only word on NFL rankings. For this feature were going to turn to the wisdom of the crowd instead, and use a ranking system one of the authors developed based on betting markets. In stock market terms, think of it as technical analysis in lieu of fundamental analysis.

Well get into the methodology in a moment but first the results. Think of each interactive table below as a playoff implications cheat sheet for this weeks upcoming games. (If you hover over a colored square, youll see details for that game.)

UPDATE (Oct. 17, 12:30 p.m.): The interactive tables above have been updated to include Thursday nights game, which now shows no playoff implications because its result is included in the playoff chances (the text of the article has not been updated).

Reading the table across tells you which teams are affected by any particular game. Reading the table down tells you which games matter most to any given team. For example, if youre a Texans fan, what games should you care about this week, how much should you care about them, and who do you want to win? The column headers are sortable, so clicking on the HOU column tells you to care about HOU @ PIT, ATL @ BAL, CIN @ IND, NYJ @ NE, CLE @ JAC, and KC @ SD  in that order. And you want the Texans, Falcons, Bengals, Jets, Jaguars and Chiefs to win.

My rankings start from the assumption that the NFL gambling market is efficient, and then attempts to determine how that efficient market ranks each of the 32 NFL teams. Unfortunately, Vegas doesnt actually share its rankings with the general public, but with a little reverse-engineering, we can arrive at a pretty good guess at what they are. We start with the point spread. For Thursday nights game, the New England Patriots are a 9.5-point favorite at home against the New York Jets. Since home field advantage is worth about 2.5 points, the market thinks the Patriots are 7 points better than the Jets when playing on a neutral field.

Armed with this interpretation, we then take the point spreads from each game and for multiple weeks and run a simple linear regression to arrive at a consensus ranking. The process is akin to drawing a map of the United States but nobody tells you a citys location. Instead, they only tell you how far away each city is from another city (e.g. Los Angeles is 1,700 miles away from Chicago, Chicago is 165 miles from Indianapolis, and so on). To further complicate matters, our map moves over time, making earlier distance measurements less reliable. For example, the Steelers opened the season as a 6-point favorite at home against the Browns. If the market were to set that point spread today, Pittsburgh would most likely drop to just a 2.5-point favorite, as the Steelers have fallen short of preseason expectations, and the Browns have exceeded them. So, the ranking methodology gives more weight to recent point spread data in an attempt to get the most up-to-date market evaluation of each team.

Now that we have a ranking system that assigns a probability to each future regular season game outcome, the next step is to simulate the season multiple times (50,000 times to be exact). After simulating win/loss records, we apply the NFL playoff seeding rules (plus tiebreakers) and summarize the results. There are already several sites that do these types of simulations for the purpose of producing team playoff odds (including FiveThirtyEight). For this feature, were going to go a bit deeper than that.

Instead of focusing on each teams overall playoff odds, lets instead focus on each game. Well use the New Orleans-Detroit game as an example. Of the 50,000 simulation runs, there were precisely 30,180 (or about 60 percent) that resulted in a Lions victory, and 19,820 that resulted in a Saints victory. Lets now focus on those two samples in isolation. Of the 30,180 simulations in which the Saints lost, they made the playoffs 8,273 times, or 27 percent. Of the 19,820 simulations in which the Saints won, they made the playoffs 9,172 times, or 46 percent. Put simply, the Saints playoff odds could swing by a not-insignificant 19 percent as a result of their game against the Lions. (The games with the most cumulative influence on the overall playoff picture (leverage) are listed at left).

We can repeat this calculation for every game and every team. The result: A measure of how much every game matters to every team.","[]"

Thats how Scout Finch describes the steadfastly Southern setting of Harper Lees beloved novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. Maycomb is a fictional city, but its based on Lees birthplace and childhood home of Monroeville, in Monroe County, Alabama, where Lee died on Friday.

Monroe County was the perfect model for the setting of the Depression-era novel. According to 1930 census data, farmers like the novels Cunningham family made up 74 percent of the county. Monroe was about half black, half white, but whites were better off by a variety of a measures. While Scouts father Atticus read to her every night, 25.8 percent of the black population was illiterate. Only 3 percent of the white population couldnt read.

Eighty-four years later, Monroe County has become smaller, whiter and richer, but the racial disparities Lee illustrated in her book still exist. We dug up the census data from 1930, when the book was set; 1960, when the book was published; and 2014, the most recent year for which data is available.

Overall, Monroe County is still poor, with a 29.2 percent poverty rate and a 41.2 percent child poverty rate, both well above the rate for the U.S. overall. Nor has the racial gap narrowed much since the novel was published, at least in Alabama as a whole (county-level data isnt available): In 1960, more than 75 percent of African-Americans in Alabama lived in poverty, which is greater than twice the white poverty rate of about 30 percent. In 2014, Alabamas black poverty rate was 33.5 percent, still about double the 15.6 percent rate among whites.

The racial income gap appears to have narrowed but remains wide. In 2014, median household income for white families in Monroe County was $38,188; for blacks it was barely half that, at $18,584. Equivalent data isnt available at a county or even state level for 1960, but in the South as a whole, the typical non-white family earned about $20,000 in 1959, one third of the amount earned by the typical white family.

And finally, what ultimately shattered Scouts childhood innocence was the wrongful jury conviction of Tom Robinson, a black man, whom Atticus defended. Data on wrongful conviction  and certainly the kind of willfully wrongful prosecution depicted in the book  doesnt exist, for obvious reasons. But more than half a century after To Kill A Mockingbird was published, issues of race and the criminal justice system remain central to the national conversation, and there have been widespread protests around the country at the way black citizens are treated by the law enforcement system. According to data from the Sentencing Project, the incarceration rate of blacks in Alabama is three and a half times as high as it is for whites. That disparity is among the smallest in the country.","[]"

"12","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-19 12:00:07+00:00","No One Can Agree How Much The Presidential Candidates Tax Plans Will Cost","['Ben Casselman']","This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news. Were still experimenting with the format, so tell us what you think. Email me or drop a note in the comments. And thank you for all the great feedback so far!

This week, the Tax Policy Center  a well-regarded non-partisan think tank  issued a report saying that Ted Cruzs tax plan would cost the government $8.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Which is fine, except that back in October, the Tax Foundation  a well-regarded nonpartisan think tank  looked at the same plan and estimated it would cost $768 billion. Even in the world of federal budgets, an $8 trillion gap is a lot of money.

Meanwhile, on the Democratic side of the race, a fight broke out among economists over the likely impact of Bernie Sanderss tax and spending plans. Others have covered the battle in more depth, but the short version is that Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts economist who has consulted for the Sanders campaign, released a report estimating that Sanderss proposals would create millions of new jobs, increase household incomes by tens of thousands of dollars and boost the overall size of the economy by more than a third. (The Sanders campaign has embraced Friedmans analysis. According to The Washington Posts Jim Tankersley, however, Friedman is not planning on voting for Sanders.) Mainstream Democratic economists responded by saying, more or less, Youve got to be kidding me; former Obama administration economic adviser Austan Goolsbee likened the Sanders plan to magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars. The Tax Foundation, for its part, estimates the Sanders proposals would shrink the economy by nearly 10 percent over the long term.

If the supposed experts cant even agree on the direction of a plans impact, is there any hope for a normal voter? Yes  but it helps to understand a few things about how experts reach these estimates, and why they differ so widely.

First, this weeks jumbled headlines notwithstanding, there is actually a lot that the experts do agree on. The Republican plans, especially Donald Trumps, would reduce federal revenues by trillions of dollars. Sanderss plan would increase both taxing and spending by trillions (the disagreement surrounds whether the new taxes would pay for all the new spending).

IMPACT ON FEDERAL REVENUE OVER 10 YEARS (TRILLIONS) CANDIDATE TAX POLICY CENTER (STATIC) TAX FOUNDATION (STATIC) TAX FOUNDATION (DYNAMIC) Jeb Bush -$6.8 $-3.7 $-1.6 Ted Cruz -8.6 -3.7 -0.8 Marco Rubio -6.8 -6.1 -2.4 Donald Trump -9.5 -12.0 -10.1 Hillary Clinton  +0.5 +0.2 Bernie Sanders  +13.6 +9.8 Estimated impacts of candidates tax plans Source: Tax Policy Center, Tax Foundation

Second, most of the disagreement among experts is about the broader economic impact of the various plans, not the plans themselves. Heres what I mean by that: Figuring out how much extra money a tweak to the tax code would bring in, or how much a new policy would cost, is relatively straightforward. This is what is known as static analysis  taken in isolation, how would these plans change things? Economists can usually agree on an answer, or at least come close. (Emphasis on usually. Some proposals, such as Sanderss single-payer health system or Cruzs value-added tax, are so dramatic that experts reach wildly different estimates of their impact.)

The trouble is, these plans dont exist in isolation: Changes in tax policy have far-reaching ripple effects on the economy. In theory, there is little doubt that we should try to take such dynamic effects into account, but in practice there is often significant disagreement among economists about how exactly to do so. The Tax Foundation, which tends to lean to the right, thinks the tax increases that Sanders is proposing will slow the economy, further reducing tax receipts (since there will be less money to tax) and making the revenue impact look larger than it would under a static model. Friedman, at UMass, thinks the extra government spending that Sanders is proposing will speed up the economy, making the plan less expensive than it looks at first.

Unfortunately, the Tax Policy Center  which, despite some criticism from Republicans in the last presidential race, is probably the closest thing out there to a neutral observer  doesnt produce dynamic estimates. But its well-regarded static estimates can still be a useful baseline. Take the TPCs recent analysis of Rubios tax plan, which the center concluded would reduce federal revenue by $6.8 trillion over 10 years, or about 2.6 percent of economic output. Thats close to half of all discretionary spending. Think of that as a worst-case scenario for Rubio. The Tax Foundations dynamic analysis  which concludes Rubios plan would cut revenues by $2.4 trillion, or about 1 percent of economic output  is, if not a best-case scenario, then at least an optimistic one. (The range of credible outcomes is wider for Cruzs plan because it has more moving parts.)

Not all points along that spectrum of possible outcomes are equally plausible, of course. Most mainstream economists think Friedmans analysis of Sanderss plan is based on unrealistic assumptions  and I tend to agree. (Economists have directed their harshest criticism at Friedmans analysis, not at the Sanders plan itself, much of which is basically a more aggressive version fairly standard liberal policies.) But that doesnt mean mainstream economists are right. At a certain point, voters still have to decide who they believe.

Too big to fail?

When Narayana Kocherlakota stepped down as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last year, he seemed certain to leave the Fed a more boring place. (I assure you, this is possible.) Kocherlakota was famous among Fed watchers for pulling a rare about-face on policy in the aftermath of the recession. Once a hawk who feared inflation, Kocherlakota became the Feds most outspoken dove, advocating for aggressive action to bring down unemployment.

Few expected Kocherlakotas successor, Neel Kashkari, to follow in his footsteps. A former Goldman Sachs banker, government official and failed California gubernatorial candidate, Kashkari had all the hallmarks of a conventional central banker.

But maybe Kashkari will keep Kocherlakotas maverick flame burning after all. We still dont know much about his views on monetary policy, but in his first speech in the new job Tuesday, Kashkari made headlines by calling for a major overhaul of Wall Street. Kashkari, who as a Treasury official under George W. Bush oversaw the bailout of the financial industry, said the big banks remain too big to fail and either need to be much more heavily regulated or else broken up. He followed up that speech by telling the Financial Times that the bailouts had eroded Americans trust in government and that the Fed needs to do more to respond to widespread economic anger.

Recession watch

With China slowing down, Europe in tatters, the stock market slumping and oil prices falling through the floor, U.S. consumers have been pretty much the only thing keeping the economy going. So it was more than a little concerning when the Commerce Department last month said that retail sales had fallen in December.

Well, never mind that. This week, the government not only said sales rose in January; it revised its December estimate to say sales rose then, too. Neither gain was particularly impressive, but at least things are headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, a key measure of the industrial sector showed better than expected growth in January, suggesting U.S. manufacturers are surviving the global slowdown.

On the other hand, Larry Summers thinks theres a one-in-three chance the U.S. will fall into a recession in the next year. So that isnt great.

Number of the week

In 1952, 2.7 million workers walked off the job (or were locked out by their employers) in 470 major work stoppages (those involving at least 1,000 workers) across the U.S. Last year, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 12 strikes and lockouts, involving just 47,000 workers. As the chart below shows, its been a long decline, which broadly mirrors the decades-long erosion of union membership.

"14","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-19 19:54:36+00:00","Non-Stars Like Channing Frye Are The Best Kind Of Trade Deadline Pickup","['Neil Paine']","Unlike last year, the 2016 NBA trade deadline was a bit of a snoozer. Nineteen players were dealt on Thursday, deadline day itself  the 12th-most since 1987. In the traditionally busy two weeks leading up to the cutoff, however, only seven others were moved, which means the raw activity around this years deadline was basically average. Quality wasnt exactly bursting out over quantity, either. As a group, the traded players averaged almost exactly zero wins above replacement per 82 games this season, the eighth-lowest rate among trade deadlines since 87. (Of course, it could be worse  sometimes an entire crop of trade targets can average out well below the replacement level, as happened in 1992.)

Most of this years trades were made by teams jockeying for playoff position (Charlottes Courtney Lee pickup comes to mind), collecting future assets (Detroit snagged Tobias Harris and Donatas Motiejunas in separate deals this week) or dumping disgruntled players (Markieff Morris and Lance Stephenson were sent packing by the Suns and Clippers, respectively). These are the kinds of incremental moves that help a franchise in the long run. But nobody would characterize them as blockbusters, and hardly any involved the handful of teams that have a chance to win the 2015-16 NBA championship.

If any contender received consensus praise at the deadline, though, it was Cleveland, which snagged Channing Frye for Anderson Varejao, Jared Cunningham and a couple of draft picks. The advanced analytics have always crushed hard on Frye  he currently ranks eighth among power forwards in ESPNs Real Plus-Minus, ahead of Anthony Davis (!)  with his classic stretch-big mix of long-distance shooting, decent-enough rebounding and surprisingly solid defensive metrics. (To that last point, RPM actually thinks Fryes defense is a far bigger contributor to his bottom-line impact than his offense.) Lets face it  nobody will be shocked if Frye ends up hitting a huge shot or two for the Cavs during whats probably going to be another deep run in the Eastern Conference playoffs.

And when it comes to deadline pickups, players like Frye often make a more indelible postseason mark than the types of big-name superstars everyone was hoping to see moved Thursday, anyway.

Statistically, the best deadline acquisition of the past 30 years was Clyde Drexler  clearly not a role player, even in his twilight  who produced 5.5 WAR for the Rockets after getting shipped to Houston for Otis Thorpe in 1995. Drexler went on to help Houston capture its second straight NBA title, but that makes him an exception among hyper-productive deadline pickups:

They can help their new teams bottom lines  since 1987, each additional WAR produced by a newcomer after the deadline has been associated with a 0.9-point improvement to his teams efficiency differential, compared with the teams differential before the trade. But oftentimes those players are shipped into situations where no amount of productivity can keep the ship from sinking or drag an average roster to playoff greatness.

And even the stars who go to good teams can arrive to mixed results. Drexler, like Jamal Mashburn in 1997 and Dikembe Mutombo in 2001, played well after landing in his new destination, but his teams net efficiency sank dramatically down the stretch of the regular season before righting itself in the playoffs.

Furthermore, because trades involve, uh, trade-offs between teams, sometimes star deals simply re-allocate strengths from one side of the ball to the other. The biggest post-deadline boost in offensive efficiency since 1987 belongs to the 1999 New Jersey Nets, which added offensive dynamo Stephon Marbury and improved their efficiency at that end by 11.6 points per 100 possessions ... but also got worse on defense by 6.6 points per 100 possessions. (Marbury didnt exactly lock opponents down on D.)

Likewise, the biggest boost in defensive efficiency belongs to last years Jazz, which improved by 10.6 points per 100 possessions on D after jettisoning defensive sieve Enes Kanter and installing Stifle Tower Rudy Gobert as starting center ... but also got worse by 2.3 points per 100 possessions on offense. Thats still a clear win for the Jazz, but it shows that blockbuster deadline trades rarely come off perfectly clean, without some downside to go with the benefits.

Which brings us back to Frye and the Cavaliers. Fryes no superstar  his wins added are modest despite his impressive RPM because he logged only 17 minutes a night in Orlando, a number that isnt likely to increase given Clevelands existing frontcourt situation. But hes in whats historically been a sweet spot for deadline pickups: Hes coming to an existing title contender at very little cost, where hell be asked to fill a specific (yet important) role. There are no guarantees on the NBA trade market, but low-risk/moderate-reward moves like the one the Cavs made to grab Frye are often the deadline deals most associated with solid playoff outcomes.","[]"

With 794 games, more than 152,000 possessions and some 372,000 plays, probably not, but weve given it a shot. What you see above is the 2014-15 seasons win probabilities, summarized. At any point in an NBA game, each team has a probability of winning based on the time remaining, the score and the situation (i.e. after a made shot, shooting foul, etc.). In the chart, each teams in-game win probability is averaged over each minute of regulation time. Its like watching a win-loss record develop in real time.

The win probability model that provides the foundation of the chart uses data from 13 NBA seasons (2000 to 2012). The model is not based on simulations, but rather it does its best to reflect how NBA games are actually played, won and lost.

One of our favorite findings: The Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks share a similar win-loss record, but theyve taken different paths to get to that point. The Warriors have shown more dominance throughout games, often building early, insurmountable leads. The Hawks, in contrast, dont pull away until the fourth quarter.

"17","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-18 21:17:42+00:00","The Pope Is Way More Popular Than Donald Trump","['Leah Libresco', 'Nate Silver']","Donald Trump took a break from threatening to sue rival candidates on Thursday and appears to be trying to start a holy war with Pope Francis instead. Trump may not care about any resulting eternal judgment, but he might have reason to worry about worldly opinion: Pope Francis has a net +53 favorability rating among Americans, while Trump has a net -27 favorability rating.

True, Pope Francis is somewhat less popular with Republicans than among Americans overall. But hes still reasonably well-liked. In a CNN poll in September, 56 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of Pope Francis as compared to 21 percent with an unfavorable one. Francis had +20 net favorability rating even among self-described tea-party supporters.

For once, this is a fight that Trump didnt start. Reporters asked Pope Francis, during one of the informal press conferences held on the papal plane what he thought of Trumps position on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The pope said that he wasnt familiar with Trumps position, but added, I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.

The majority of conservative Catholics would probably agree with that assessment of Trumps faith. According to a survey conducted in January by the Pew Research Center, just under half (49 percent) of Catholics who are Republicans or lean toward the GOP said that Trump was not very or not at all religious. That was the highest level of skepticism expressed by any of the denominations Pew surveyed. (White mainline Protestants were most likely to give Trump the benefit of the doubt; 35 percent judged him to be not very or not at all religious.)

However, a sizable share of Catholics are open to seeing Trump in the White House, even if they dont expect to see him in a pew. In Pews survey, 30 percent of all Catholics who are registered to vote said they felt that Trump would be a good or great president. Thats pretty much on par with registered voters in general (31 percent). In other words, Catholics are swing voters. In 2012, Catholics gave 50 percent of their votes to Barack Obama and 48 percent to Mitt Romney, according to the national exit poll.

Trump doesnt need to worry as much about winning over Catholics in coming weeks. The next set of GOP primaries doesnt occur in heavily Catholic states. Super Tuesdays contests on March 1 will include Massachusetts, where Catholics made up 51 percent of Republican voters in 2008, but most of the upcoming states are in the South, where few Catholics reside.

STATE WINNER AMONG CATHOLICS (2008) CATHOLIC SHARE OF GOP ELECTORATE (2008) New Jersey McCain 57% Massachusetts Romney 51 New York McCain 46 Connecticut McCain 45 Wisconsin McCain 39 New Hampshire McCain/Romney tie 38 Vermont McCain 35 Maryland McCain 33 Louisiana McCain 32 Illinois McCain 31 Florida McCain 30 Michigan Romney 29 Delaware McCain 28 Ohio McCain 26 California McCain 25 Missouri McCain 20 Arizona McCain 20 Virginia McCain 19 Nevada Romney 18 Texas McCain 16 South Carolina McCain 13 Oklahoma ** 11 Georgia Romney 11 Mississippi ** 9 Tennessee McCain 6 Arkansas ** 6 Alabama ** 5 Utah ** 3 Where are the Republican Catholics? ** Sample size too small to reliably determine winner among Catholics Source: Edison/Mitofsky National Election Pool Exit Polls, 2008

But although the Catholic-heavy states fall later, they could prove important to the delegate math. Many of their delegates are awarded on a winner-take-most (as in New York, where 46 percent of the Republican electorate was Catholic in 2008) or winner-take-all (as in New Jersey, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) basis. So if Trump doubles down on his fight with the pope, he could wind up paying a price as he seeks to expand his coalition beyond his enthusiastic base  particularly given that he may already have a relatively low ceiling on his support. In 2008, another competitive primary (and one with more comprehensive exit polling than 2012), Catholics were an important part of John McCains coalition, and theyre a group that a candidate like Marco Rubio (who is Catholic) or John Kasich could come to rely upon this year.

Plus its just plain inaccurate to complain, as Trump did, that for a religious leader to question a persons faith is disgraceful. For someone whose titles include Vicar of Jesus Christ and Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, questioning and clarifying other peoples faith is pretty much the job description.","[]"

"19","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-19 20:26:15+00:00","Everyone Still Reads To Kill A Mockingbird","['Hayley Munguia']","On Friday, the mayors office in Monroeville, Alabama, announced that Harper Lee, author of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird and its controversy-plagued 2015 sequel Go Set A Watchman, had died at age 89. A look at the numbers behind Lees greatest work bear out its prominent place in American culture.

In 2012, the Fordham Institute, an education policy think tank, surveyed 484 high school English teachers about which books they assigned. According to the groups study, Mockingbird was taught by more ninth- and 10th-grade teachers  35 percent of them  than any other book of fiction listed. It also tops most works in other categories, including poetry and plays. Mockingbird beats the most-taught works of Mark Twain, Shakespeare or John Steinbeck. The only reading material that topped it was Martin Luther King Jr.s I Have A Dream speech, which was taught by 38 percent of teachers in those grades.

The book is also widely taught on college campuses. According to the Open Syllabus Project, which tracks books that are listed on more than a million college syllabi nationwide, To Kill a Mockingbird was assigned 633 times, making it the 255th-most-assigned book in the database  an impressive rank, considering that the vast majority of the titles are either textbooks or predate the 20th century. (Of the top 10 books, only two  E.B. White and William Strunk Jr.s The Elements of Style and Neil Campbells textbook Biology  were published after 1850.)

In terms of determining where To Kill a Mockingbird stands among similar texts, the Open Syllabus Project also has data on which books are the most likely to be assigned together in college, which could be a somewhat more useful proxy for comparing books that contributed to American culture in the same way. To Kill a Mockingbird was most likely to be assigned along with J.D. Salingers The Catcher in the Rye, William Goldings Lord of the Flies, F. Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby and George Orwells Animal Farm.

To get a sense of how popular these books are beyond college classrooms, Goodreads is the place to go. Of the five books listed above, To Kill a Mockingbird has both the highest number of ratings and the highest average rating, 4.23 out of 5 stars.

But even though theres a pretty established consensus that its a great book (though there are dissenting opinions), Google search data shows that we probably cant separate it  or any of the books associated with it  from the classroom.

The seasonality of the search data hints at the link between the books popularity and their use in the classroom. Most searches for the five books take place around May every year, presumably when students are studying for finals or writing essays. Theres also a similar, albeit smaller, uptick around November or December every year  another indicator of cramming for midterms or finals.

The May 2013 spike in searches for The Great Gatsby is no doubt tied to the release of Baz Luhrmanns film adaptation. But even with that factored in, To Kill a Mockingbird still wins the search game over time; until 2012, Lees novel was the most-searched of the five, and on average since 2004, its still been searched about 10 percent more often than Fitzgeralds.

The data on Lees influence is clear, but it really just tells us what we already know: By grappling with racial injustice in American society  an issue that we still struggle with  Harper Lees work endures, and will continue to do so for many years to come.","[]"

Subscribe: iTunes | Download | RSS | Video

Accept, for a moment, that dog shows are like any other sporting event, and youll soon notice that they have their own legendary dynasty. That dynasty is the terrier. As FiveThirtyEights Oliver Roeder recently wrote, the terrier won 29 of the first 43 Best in Shows awarded at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the sports premier event.

On this weeks episode of our podcast Whats The Point, we visit the Westminster show and chat with Ollie about the terriers dominance, how data may change dog shows, and why other breeds are beginning to catch up. Plus, we meet a bunch of cute dogs.

To listen, stream or download the full episode above, or subscribe using your favorite podcast app. Below, a few highlights from Ollies piece, which you can read in full on FiveThirtyEight.

The fall of the terrier

The American Kennel Club, which is the governing body for dog shows and whose membership includes Westminster, tallies the most popular breeds in the country each year, going back to 1935. This data is based on purebred dog registrations with the club, which says it registers nearly 1 million dogs each year. (There are something like 80 million dogs owned in the U.S.) [In the mid-20th century,] many of the all-star terrier breeds began to decline. This fall from prominence has affected more than the multi-champion terrier breeds. The Dandie Dinmont, the Skye, the Kerry Blue, the Bedlington, the Welsh, the standard Manchester, the Australian and the Lakeland have all seen significant declines in popularity, as well. For some terrier breeds, the situation is existential. In 2011, a campaign was launched to save the Sealyham terrier  winner of four Westminster Best in Shows and once the dog of choice of King George V, Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor  from extinction. If we can save the rhino or tiger, we can surely save this useful and charming breed of dog, the British magazine Country Life wrote.

Just three days into its new season, which starts in September, the Met will have already returned to its most-performed work: Puccinis La Boheme. About a month after that, Verdis Aida will take the stage. Two-and-a-half months after that: Bizets Carmen. The three most-performed works in Metropolitan Opera history will all appear next season, as is so often the case.

Opera types call them the ABCs for the letters in their titles  and because theyre staples of opera repertories. When you add in the fourth-most-performed opera in Met history, Verdis La Traviata, which will also be staged next season, those four operas will account for nearly a quarter of all the Mets performances next season  even though 22 other operas are being mounted. That top tier of operas are a class unto themselves: Company archives show that a season rarely goes by without them. You can see that below in the chart, which compares those top-tier operas with others being performed next season.

Since its Met premiere in 1900, La Boheme has been staged in all but eight seasons, according to the Met archives. And the current Franco Zeffirelli production, unveiled in 1981, is the most-seen production of all operas in the companys history, according to John Pennino, an archivist at the Met. Some recent years have yielded as many as 25 performances in a season of 242.

As a close observer of the opera world, I wouldnt dare suggest that the top-tier operas dont deserve such frequent showings. Theres a reason theyre beloved: Aida evokes ancient Egypt through grand sets and choruses; La Boheme has unforgettable characters who embody the transience of life and art; Carmen wraps lushly exotic melodies around the story of a femme fatale; and La Traviata portrays an ill-fated love affair with both glamour and intimacy.

But for the Met, which is the countrys largest and most influential opera company, their unrivaled popularity can present a challenge: How can it expand its repertoire while being dependent on the top tiers popularity?

The top four works are reliable entry points for many newcomers  crucial at a time when the Met has been grappling with an aging subscriber base and a sluggish box office. Overplaying them, though, could take up slots that would otherwise go to lesser-known works. Thats a tension almost any premier artistic institution has to work through: how to stay solvent while trying to advance the art form. General manager Peter Gelb told The New York Times on Wednesday that the company is always trying to find ways to satisfy confirmed opera lovers, as well as excite new ones. Under Gelb, the Met has sought to replace aging productions with new, modernized stagings, and traditionalists have sometimes responded harshly. Six new productions are planned for 2016-17. (The Met declined to comment when we asked about the repertory balance.)

In September, the Met reported that houses were, in aggregate, 74 percent full during its 2014-15 season, compared with 76.9 percent the previous season. Over the past couple of years, the company has faced a multimillion-dollar shortfall that it has since closed; last season, it reported a $1 million surplus.

The Met hopes to see newcomers become the confirmed opera lovers of tomorrow, but creating a path from La Boheme to an arcane gem by Handel or a premiere by Nico Muhly is not a simple proposition. If theres a way forward, it involves a healthy opera ecosystem in which the old favorites, lesser-known operas and contemporary works co-exist and opera-goers are steered from one to the next.

Once youve seen Mimis death scene in La Boheme for the umpteenth time, its nice to know theres something else to see every now and then.","[]"
"22","fivethirtyeight","2014-11-21 17:46:32+00:00","Skeptical Football: Patriots vs. Cardinals And An Interactive History Of The NFL","['Benjamin Morris']","The first 10 games of the NFL season are its exposition period  we get to know the characters and themes that we expect to see develop as the race to the playoffs unfolds. This year, like nearly every other in the past decade, the New England Patriots refusal to regress to the mean is a central storyline.

Remember back when the Patriots were 0-1 and faced a must-win in Week 2? Well, they won. Then in Week 4 they dropped to 2-2, and the end of an era was supposedly nigh. Except no. Pats will be Pats, and now theyve won their last six games en route to the best record in the AFC. That streak has included comfortable wins against the Cincinnati Bengals (who at one point projected to have the best record), the surprisingly strong Buffalo Bills, and Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. (The Patriots are also tied with the Green Bay Packers for a league-leading point differential). And according to my colleague Neil Paine, the Patriots are really a second-half team. I shudder to think.

But theres another storyline thats dominated the exposition period: The best record in the NFL belongs to the 9-1 Arizona Cardinals. While theyve beaten some decent teams like Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco, they dont have what the yakkers call a signature win. They have only the seventh-best SRS in football, second to the Packers in the NFC, and only a half-point ahead of the defending champion Seattle Seahawks (who have four losses).

Aside from being the class of their respective conferences so far this year, the two franchises have little in common. The Cardinals have now secured their second winning season in a row  and can count that as an accomplishment in light of their 90-year history of losing. Although the Patriots dominance of the regular season continues apace, they will likely be disappointed if they dont win their first Super Bowl in 10 years.

To illustrate just how divergent these two franchises have been, I created a chart to show the entire history of the NFL (or at least what we have stats for). This is the cumulative regular-season point differential since 1920, for all teams (with the Patriots and the Cardinals highlighted):

The current Patriots dynasty is lengthy and steep, and belongs in the same group as the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, the Cleveland Browns of the 50s and 60s, or the Chicago Bears of the 30s and 40s (especially when you factor in league parity).

That chart is fun, but it would be a lot more useful if we could make out all 81 NFL franchises individually. Well ...

Chart of the week

Thanks to the great work of designated Skeptical Football charts guru Reuben Fischer-Baum, you can do just that. Roll over a line to see the teams entire history, and move along the line to see exactly how many points it has scored compared to its opponents at a given point. You can also click on a team to keep its line highlighted, and then roll over another team for comparison. Irrelevant dates (where no regular-season games were played) are excluded from the timeline.

Here are a couple of things I found from the interactive that I thought were interesting:

Even more Aaron Rodgers

First, Aaron Rodgers  apparently unmoved by my ongoing criticism of his failure to throw more interceptions  is absolutely tearing it up this year (at least when his team is ahead, which is most of the time lately). Recently, he accomplished something pretty cool that I didnt know about:

On Sept. 25, 2011, Rodgers threw three touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 27-17. With that result, the Packers had scored 2,991 more points than their opponents all-time, ahead of the Bears 2,989  and the Packers havent looked back. As of last Sunday, Green Bay held the NFLs best historical margin of victory by 358 points.

Comment of the week

Last week Neil Paine and I wrote an article titled Randy Moss May Well Have Been The Greatest Receiver Of All Time  which focused on the insane With Or Without You stats that Moss put up in his career. In the discussion, we raised the possibility that if receivers can have as much of an impact as Randy Moss appeared to have, that may cast doubt on some previous knowledge  like how good of a quarterback Joe Montana was considering he had Jerry Rice running routes for so long.

A few different people in the comments and elsewhere raised the point that Joe Montana had already won two Super Bowls before Jerry Rice arrived in San Francisco:

Upon further consideration, Im inclined to agree that its fairly unlikely that Rice was the driving force behind the 49ers success. But Im not so sure Montana was either.

Winning in the NFL can happen for a lot of different reasons  a star quarterback (think Peyton Manning), a successful new offensive or defensive strategy (think West Coast offense, zone blitz, or, more recently, the Wildcat), or a standout player who creates mismatches that other teams struggle with (think Randy Moss). But the effects of various win-generating phenomena can come in a lot of shapes and sizes.

For example, lets compare the 49ers to the St. Louis Rams. Pay particular attention to the Greatest Show on Turf era from 1999 into the early 2000s:

The Greatest Show on Turf Rams had a few different things going for them, but their success was sudden, rocky, and lasted only a few years. They broke the game for a while in the sense that they were something the rest of the NFL didnt know how to deal with. But despite having a lasting effect on how football is played, their dominance was fragile.

On the other hand, from the early 80s to the late 90s, the 49ers outscored their opponents by around 2,500 points  by far the most dominant stretch in the Super Bowl era. And they did it with a practically straight line, meaning they were better than their opposition by a nearly constant amount.

If the 49ers owed a significant part of their success to any one player (or phenomenon of any kind), wed likely see more variety in the teams arc as that players performance fluctuated, or as he was injured, or left. But the consistency of the 49ers ascension suggests they were more of an organization-driven phenomenon. At the very least, it implies that they were the sum of many different quality parts.

Playing around with the interactive, Im fascinated by how different phenomena manifest. For example: How do the impacts of offensive and defensive innovation compare? What are the effects of a quarterback versus those of a coach? There are a lot of possibilities, so let us know what you uncover in the comments or on Twitter.

Week 11 kicking awards

I keep thinking (and my editor keeps hoping) this will be the week I wont bother talking about kickers, but then Las Vegas Locomotives alumnus Graham Gano has to go and attempt a 63-yard field goal with one second left in a thriller between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately for the Panthers, it was blocked.

My kicking model suggests that a kicker in 2014 should typically be able to make a 63-yard field goal around 40 percent of the time  but this may be skewed by the fact that such long kicks are so rarely attempted. Still, Ganos 63-yarder wasnt what earned him the kicker loss and Week 11s Least Valuable Kicker award. What did him in was his previous miss, a 46-yarder, which a 2014 NFL kicker should typically make about 77 percent of the time.

My algorithm picked the Falcons Matt Bryant as the MVK over the St. Louis Rams Greg Zeurlein (who had an excellent week, going 5/5 with two 50+ yarders in the Rams huge upset of the Broncos), on account of Bryant making four field goals in a game his team only won by two (though none was over 44 yards).

But the biggest news of the week is that with Nick Novak missing a kick for the San Diego Chargers, were down to just two perfect kickers, and theyre both veterans: the Indianapolis Colts Adam Vinatieri and the New York Giants Josh Brown.

Gunslinger of the week

There were 26 interceptions thrown in Week 11, and seven of them were thrown by the Manning brothers. Eli Manning had five in the Giants narrow loss against the 49ers  four of which were thrown with his team trailing  enough to win him our Gunslinger of the Week award.

Throwing a practically embarrassing number of interceptions now and then is something great quarterbacks do. QBs, dont be ashamed of looking bad when trying to win! A loss is a loss, whether you throw zero interceptions or six. My maxim is: If a quarterback loses a game without throwing a few interceptions, he probably didnt try hard enough.

In general, Eli Manning is a bit of an unknown. He puts up fairly big totals for a mediocre team, but often gets criticized for his high interception rate. Yet his win curve looks mostly like his big brothers, only flatter, and its plausible that his shame-free style was partially responsible for the Giants shocking wins in two Super Bowls. Elis gambling wouldnt necessarily make the Giants favorites against stronger competition, but it might have given them a better chance against a team like the 2007 Patriots than a better team with a quarterback who took fewer risks.

Just for fun, I looked at the Pro Football Reference list of quarterbacks with the most four-plus-interception games. The top four are George Blanda, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler and Terry Bradshaw (all of whom won championships, and three of whom are in the Hall of Fame). Of the top 50 such QBs, 15 have won championships (and account for 20 Super Bowls), including both brothers Manning.

Rookie QB watch

The biggest news in rookie QB-land was in Tennessee, where sixth-round-pick Zach Mettenberger had a fairly strong game against the Pittsburgh Steelers (263 yards and two touchdowns). Hes now guaranteed to reach the magical four-start line when rookie QBs are more likely to have successful careers. Im not quite ready to move him up in the rankings just yet, but every pass he completes is one more than Johnny Manziel has completed all year. As of now, Id order the rookies estimated career prospects like so:

The Jacksonville Jaguars Blake Bortles had a bye week. The Oakland Raiders Derek Carr, despite finally winning a game Thursday night (in dramatic fashion) has had a pretty weak couple of weeks, with just 172 and 174 yards in Weeks 11 and 12, despite a combined 69 pass attempts. The Minnesota Vikings Teddy Bridgewaters two game winning streak came to an end in Chicago. Mettenberger. The Patriots Jimmy Garropolo. Manziel once again got all dressed up with no ball to throw.

Not really in the game yet but worth keeping an eye on: Logan Thomas is now second on the depth chart in Arizona. So far this year he has a 108.9 NFL Passer Rating, but hes gotten it the hard way: He has only one completion in eight attempts (10 if you count sacks), but it went for 81 yards and a touchdown.

Reader response

In Week 9s column, I introduced my experimental win curves for quarterbacks, which depict how much each QB typically wins relative to various expectations, and I included a number of examples.

I covered most popular quarterbacks, with a couple of notable exceptions. One request I got an awful lot:

@skepticalsports As a Bears fan, I'd love to see the ""Win Curve"" for Jay Cutler that you wrote about in your latest @FiveThirtyEight column  John D. Kos (@johndkos) November 7, 2014

I would have included Cutler initially, but I had a problem with his curve: It was coming out as a perfectly straight line, virtually indistinguishable from the y=x guide (a highly unlikely outcome). I thought this might have been a data problem, but it turns out Cutlers results really were just too vanilla for the method I was using to pick up the variation. So I tried an alternate method that is more sensitive to small variation. The alternate method turned out to be less sensitive to large variation as well, so I was able to plot a couple more notable quarterbacks as well as Cutler:

Russell Wilson  like his comrade Andrew Luck  has a very impressive curve so far in his career, albeit over a sample still probably too small for this analysis. (He also gets very good support from a strong team around him.)

Cutlers curve is still remarkably unremarkable, but at least it shows up. He appears to do slightly above average regardless of the circumstances. As a special treat for Bears fans who had to wait two weeks  and because I wanted to see what was going into this virtually straight line  Ive broken down Cutlers curve by quarter, and compared each to the same breakdown for Peyton Manning (our standard-bearer for such things):

Being very far ahead or behind in the first quarter is rare, so you should take the tails of that quadrant with a grain of salt. In the second and fourth quarters, Cutler seems to outperform average in a pretty uniform way, and in the third-quarter he has a bit of a reverse-Matthew Stafford thing going on.

Most empirically significant game of this week

The Cardinals matchup against the defending champion Seahawks is a pretty big test for the team with the leagues best record.

But on top of that, the Cardinals have a lot of important parts coming and going, which is always empirically significant: Their top QB (Carson Palmer) is out. Last week, Cardinals backup Drew Stanton held off the Detroit Lions Stafford at the end of the game, but the Cardinals still struggled. Leading for most of the game, they rushed 26 times, but gained only 46 yards. And their top receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, is injured but may play anyway. As demonstrated in the article on Moss, the value of top-notch WRs can affect our broader understanding of the game.

And then there are the Seahawks  who were young powerhouses last year, but are possibly already in decline  and Russell Wilson, who last year averaged 33.7 yards rushing per game. Thats by far the most of any QB in a year his team won the Super Bowl  and hes averaging 57.1 per game this year. What running quarterbacks mean for the game is a fascinating open question. A lot of newer, fancier QB-rating systems are giving QBs a lot of credit for their scrambling (often much more than if you treated those plays the same as completed pass attempts). But while those individual plays can be valuable, there havent been a lot of dynamic offenses built around running QBs, and its still unclear whether this is just a bonus skill or whether it will be a necessity in the future NFL.

Its perhaps even more valuable to see Wilson in action with the Seahawks struggling a bit (it can also be harder to isolate an individual players contributions when a team is firing on all cylinders). Hell be tested against a Cardinals defense that grades out as one of the best in the NFL this year  a perfect opportunity to see what both are made of.

Weve been inundated with polls: South Carolina polls, Nevada polls, national polls, general election polls. In fact, there are so many polls that you can tell yourself pretty much any story you like about the Republican presidential primary. Is Ted Cruz surging? Theres a poll for that. Is Cruz stalling out? Theres a poll for that too. Have you heard about the poll showing a Ben Carson comeback? OK, I made that one up. But earlier this week, you could find a poll with John Kasich in second place in South Carolina, even though he was polling at about 2 percent there earlier this month.

If this were a general election, wed just say take the average and be done with it. Thats still pretty good advice. The average lets us say, with a high degree of confidence, that Donald Trump is ahead in South Carolina. (That parts easy: Trump has led in all but one poll there since July.) With a slightly lesser but still high degree of confidence we can say that Marco Rubio has gained ground: He was at 13.1 percent in our South Carolina polling average before Iowa and is at 16.8 percent now. We can also say that Trump has probably lost a couple of percentage points, but probably not more. We can say that Jeb Bushs numbers are flatter than the places listed here.

But unlike in the general election, where the polling average usually gives you a fairly precise estimate of where the race will end up, the South Carolina polls could still wind up being way off. We warned you about this before Iowa, where the polls mispredicted the order of finish, and likewise before New Hampshire, where they were closer to the mark (although hardly perfect). Were probably going to have to keep warning you until the Republican race settles down to only two or three major candidates  multiway races are historically associated with much larger polling errors.

So instead of pretending we know exactly how things will turn out, lets look at the most likely range of outcomes for each candidate as defined by our polls-plus forecast and consider how those outcomes might affect the race going forward.

Donald Trump

90th percentile forecast: 42 percent

10th percentile forecast: 22 percent

Trump is a heavy favorite in South Carolina. He has a 78 percent chance of winning the state according to polls-plus and an 83 percent chance by our simpler polls-only model  although hes not quite completely safe. In fact, its not that hard to imagine the scenario in which Trump loses: Suppose that this weeks NBC/Marist poll had the race pegged correctly, with Cruz within striking distance, and that Trump fares poorly among late-deciders, as was true in Iowa. That NBC/Marist poll sure looks a lot like the pre-Iowa polling average, doesnt it? Additionally, maybe Trumps comments about the pope will hurt him?

Fortunately for Trump, the NBC/Marist poll is an outlier relative to the prevailing trend. More likely, Trump will win South Carolina, but the share of the vote he secures while doing so is important. Why did Trump get 35 percent of the vote in New Hampshire but only 24 percent in Iowa? Was it because Iowa is a caucus and New Hampshire a primary? Is it that New Hampshire is in the Northeast and Iowa is in the Midwest? (The Northeast and the South seem to be stronger regions for Trump than the Midwest or the West.) Well get more data about that in South Carolina. Perhaps the single most important question in the Republican race is how high Trumps ceiling is and whether he can eventually get to 50+ percent of the GOP electorate. If Trump wins South Carolina with, say, 41 percent of the vote, hell be much closer to that majority than if he limps through to a victory with 26 percent instead.

Ted Cruz

90th percentile forecast: 28 percent

10th percentile forecast: 12 percent

It can be a dangerous game to predict in which direction the polls might be off. But for Cruz, Id probably take the over on 19 percent, his standing in our current polling average. The reason is simply that South Carolinas evangelical-heavy demographics are not that different from Iowas, where Cruz won with 28 percent of the vote. Even if you knock off a few points for Cruzs ground game being less helpful to him in a primary than a caucus, it shouldnt be a stretch for him to wind up in the low 20s.

And yet, maybe some things have changed since Iowa. Cruzs favorability ratings, which until recently were among the best in the GOP field, have begun to fray as hes come under attack more often both from other candidates and from Republican Party elites. Cruzs colleagues dont like the guy  he has no endorsements yet from his fellow senators  and maybe he isnt wearing well with Republican voters either.

I also believe that Cruz doesnt have much of a shot at the nomination unless he finishes toward the higher end of his range. Cruz is at a delegate-math disadvantage in the primaries: Most of the states where he should be strong divide their delegates fairly proportionately, whereas the coastal and northerly states that vote later are winner-take-all or winner-take-most. If Cruz cant get out to a pretty big delegate lead after Super Tuesday, its going to be hard for him to catch up later. And if he cant win South Carolina or at least come pretty close, its hard to see him doing all that well in other Southern states on Super Tuesday.

Marco Rubio

90th percentile forecast: 27 percent

10th percentile forecast: 12 percent

Rubio is nearly tied with Cruz for second place in the polls-plus forecast, but thats because polls-plus gives Rubio some credit for his growing lead in endorsements  including the backing of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. In the polls-only forecast, by contrast, Cruz is a couple of percentage points ahead of Rubio.

Im sweating the details on this one because the national media seems to have a hyperbolic reaction to all things Rubio, alternatively declaring him to be on the verge of a breakout or predicting his imminent demise, as they did after New Hampshire. Rubio, who is acceptable to many Republicans but impassions few of them, may be more susceptible to actual or perceived momentum than a love-him-or-hate-him candidate like Trump.

Rubios playing a long game, however. Even under the best of circumstances, hes likely to lose most of the Super Tuesday states to Trump or Cruz. Even under the worst of circumstances, Republicans may come back around to Rubio by process of elimination. That endorsers such as Haley threw their support to Rubio even after his New Hampshire debacle is partly a reflection of Rubios resilience  he was reasonably good in last weeks debate, and his polls have held up pretty well  but also an indictment of Bush, Kasich and the other alternatives.

So Ill be looking to two benchmarks for Rubio. One is whether he approaches 20 percent of the vote; as The New York Times Nate Cohn points out, thats a key threshold for Rubio because many Super Tuesday states use 20 percent as a minimum threshold for awarding delegates. The other, more obvious one is how Rubio fares relative to Bush. Lets talk about Jeb!

Jeb Bush

90th percentile forecast: 19 percent

10th percentile forecast: 6 percent

I thought Bush was effective in the last couple of debates. His ground game was surprisingly impressive when we visited Iowa. Bush and his super PAC are still dropping more money than any other candidate: In South Carolina, the Right to Rise PAC backing Bush had spent roughly $13 million on ads through Feb. 14 according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, almost as much as all other Republican candidates and super PACs combined (about $17 million).

So the fact that Bush performed so poorly in Iowa and New Hampshire (dont give me any spin about his having beaten expectations)  and that his numbers have been so flat in South Carolina despite the spending, the debates and the Bush family jamboree  would seem to suggest that Republican voters simply arent buying what hes selling.

Frankly, this has seemed apparent to us for a long time. Nonetheless, Ill keep an open mind about Bush until we get this last bit of evidence, which is how he fares among South Carolina voters. The thing about the primaries is that they can string candidates along. If Bush can spin some kind of narrative about South Carolina to his donors, welp, its only three more days until Nevada and then just seven more days until Super Tuesday and then just another week until Michigan and then just a week more until Florida votes on March 15. Even if Bush is a zombie candidate, his presence in the race makes it hard for the field to consolidate.

Theres also an outside chance that Bush could do legitimately well in South Carolina instead of just muddling through. Some state polls have had Bush in the mid-teens, and our polls-plus model gives him a 27 percent chance of finishing in the top three and even an outside chance of a second-place finish. Personally, I dont see a Bush second place happening. But one advantage of a statistical model is that it can force you to consider possibilities you might otherwise be too dismissive of.

GOP primary Percentages displayed are from FiveThirtyEights polls-plus forecast

John Kasich

90th percentile forecast: 16 percent

10th percentile forecast: 5 percent

Kasich has gotten a pretty sizable post-New Hampshire bounce. Hes gained about 6 percentage points in South Carolina polls since New Hampshire, according to our polling average, and also several points in national polls. The problem is that Kasich was starting out at about 2 percent in both cases, so even a fairly large bounce doesnt really put him on the radar. Kasich doesnt have a lot on the line in South Carolina  in fact, hell abandon the state as votes roll in Saturday to campaign in the Republican stronghold of Massachusetts  but his best scenario is that he beats Bush while Rubio also fares poorly.

Ben Carson

90th percentile forecast: 13 percent

10th percentile forecast: 3 percent

Speaking of zombie campaigns, Ben Carson is still running for president! And his presence matters a little more than you might think. A fraction of Carsons roughly 7 percent of the vote could be the difference between Cruz winning states on Super Tuesday and losing them to Trump, or between Rubio hitting delegate thresholds and failing to do so.

"24","fivethirtyeight","2016-02-18 23:31:46+00:00","China Is Splurging On Big-Name Soccer Talent","['Andrew Flowers']","In the past few weeks, the Chinese Football Association Super League  the countrys premier professional soccer league  has been on a shopping spree. By the close of the January transfer window, the Chinese Super League had outspent Englands Premier League in the transfer market; the CSL made five of the six largest transfer signings in the 2015-16 window.

The biggest splash came when the Jiangsu Suning shelled out $55 million to acquire Alex Teixeira, a star Brazilian midfielder playing in Ukraine, who was hotly pursued by Liverpool. Teixeiras signing gives the CSL the 70th most valuable player in the world.

By attracting big-name talent, CSL clubs are signaling the rise of Chinese soccer power  at least financially. (The value of the signings to club owners likely has as much to do with marketability of the players for product endorsement purposes as it does with improving the team.) This power has grown in lockstep with the leagues attendance and revenue. Since the league was founded in 2004, total CSL attendance has surged from 1.4 million to more than 5 million in 2015; per-game attendance has more than doubled as the league has grown from 12 to 16 teams.

As Chinese soccer has grown domestically, the league has begun to throw around its financial weight in the international transfer market, thus boosting the total market value of CSL players. The leagues total value, according to Transfermarkt estimates of its players transfer market values (as opposed to aggregate transfer buys) has risen to about $380 million. Teixeiras transfer fee alone accounts for 15 percent of that. Thats humongous. Gareth Bales record-breaking (unless you ask Ronaldo) transfer fee to Real Madrid in 2013 came in north of $100 million, yet represented a mere 3 percent of the more than $3.4 billion estimated market value of La Ligas players in 2013.

Although the CSL is making international news with a few big-ticket signings, as a whole, the league is still small. The leagues total estimated market value is still half as big as even Portugals national league, and it pales in comparison to Englands Premier League, which is valued at $4.7 billion. In fact, the total market value of all 16 CSL teams is still less than that of just Liverpool. Thus, a transfer fee comparable to the one between the CSL and Teixeira would be about $700 million (!).

(As CSL teams make it rain, its worth noting that this cash isnt being evenly distributed. Foreign players make far more than Chinese players. CSL teams must abide by a strict cap of no more than four overseas players, plus one from another country in the Asian Football Confederation. And according to 2012 data, these foreign players pulled in earnings more than five times larger than those of their Chinese teammates. The disparity has probably only grown as the CSL hunts for pricier international stars.)

In some ways, the CSL has taken Major League Soccers model and supercharged it. MLS has tried  with debatable success  to gin up fan interest by splurging on a few big-name, often well-aged, international players. David Beckham joining the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007 on a (comically inaccurate) $250 million deal comes to mind. By the 2008 season, the entire MLS had an estimated market value of about $157 million; with more than $10 million of that being Beckham. Today, that number has crept up to $314 million  exponential growth, but well behind the pace being set in China. So the CSL is following the MLS script, to a degree, only with players in their primes instead of broken-down warhorses like Frank Lampard.

Some macroeconomic context helps, too. Although there are signs that Chinas economy is slowing, and its stock market has been a disaster over the past year, the appetite of Chinese sports fans doesnt seem to be lagging. The slowdown within the Chinese economy seems to be focused on real estate, state-owned enterprises and the stock market. Although growing indebtedness is an issue, Chinese consumers are better positioned than other parts of the Chinese economy. So expect demand for  and spending from  Chinese Super League teams to keep growing. China has a very long way to go before its a top player in international club soccer, but if consumer interest grows at the pace its set, the CSL might just continue to draw stars anyway.

CORRECTION (Feb. 19, 2 p.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the basis for determining the monetary valuation of players in soccer teams and leagues. That valuation is measured by a Transfermarkt calculation of overall player market values, not just salaries. Transfermarkt makes the calculation based on the estimated value of the player in the transfer market. References in the article to how much teams and leagues have spent on salaries have been changed to the market values of their players.","[]"
