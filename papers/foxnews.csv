"31","foxnews","2014-05-05 00:00:00","Demystifying flying: What is an air pocket?","['Tom Bunn']","If youve been a passenger in an airplane, its likely that you have felt an air pocket, or what feels like a quick drop in the air.

""Air pocket"" is merely another term for ordinary turbulence. You might feel as if you're falling from the sky, but rest assured, if you flying commercially, you rarely gain or lose more than about twenty feet, especially if the plane is on autopilot.

The term ""air pocket"" comes from early aviation, a time when pilots flying open-cockpit biplanes took adventurous locals on a rides in their flying machines. These planes, with two wings one above the other, flew at relatively slow speeds. When the plane entered air that, instead of simply sitting there, was flowing slightly upward or slightly downward, the plane's path was altered slightly upward or slightly downward. Air pockets do not technically exist, yet it's an expression that has caught on and is still misused today.

So what happens when you experience a bumpy ride that rattles glasses and turns some knuckles white?

The first thing you need to understand is a basic rule of flying: the earth has different surface temperatures that impacts flight as the aircraft passes through. For example, the surface of a lake is cooler than the surrounding earth, or plowed fields have a different surface temperature than those that are unplowed. Warm air is lighter than cool air. Warmed air rises. Cooled air descends. When a plane encounters varying airflow, we can feel what we call an air pocket today.

The idea of an ""air pocket"" might seem reassuring from a pilot's point of view, for a pocket is something you slip your hand into. When you do, your hand can only go so far. But, over the years, the phrase has come to be thought of as an area where there is no air. With no air, what is going to hold the plane up?

The term, if misunderstood, can lead to fear that an ""air pocket"" - a place devoid of air - could be big enough to cause a plane to plunge to the earth or go out of control. But it doesn't exist.

It may be helpful to try to imagine a ""water pocket,"" an area in a lake where there is no water. You can't, right? Since you can see water, it is hard to conceive of such a thing as a water pocket.

One analogy that is helpful to my clients is picturing the sky as one large bowl of Jello. Imagine that large bowl of chilled Jello with a small, plastic airplane in the middle. Now, pick up the bowl and shake it. The airplane certainly moves and jiggles, but it is impossible for the small plastic toy to fall out of the bowl (the sky).

Flying through an ""air pocket"" isn't much different from driving your car over a pot hole or steering a boat over waves. It may be bumpy, but you're rarely in danger --that is unless you're not wearing a seat belt.

Captain Tom Bunn, retired airline pilot and licensed therapist, is the founder of SOAR, a program designed to help those with fear of flying and flight-related anxieties.","[]"

Del Potro, who has undergone three surgeries on his left wrist and one on his right wrist, had been out of action since the Miami Masters in March 2015.

Querrey dictated the pace on Saturday night and was able to pull off the win in a close match, breaking Del Potro on two of his three break opportunities.

"40","foxnews","2016-02-18 00:00:00","Is Chipotle really America's 'emotionally abusive boyfriend?'","['Grace E']","On Sunday, TV host and comedian John Oliver skewered Chipotle over its food safety problems.

The host of HBO's ""Last Week Tonight,"" called Chipotle ""America's preferred over-the-counter laxative.""

He ran down a list of Chipotle's problems over the past months, including E. Coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks. He also had a mock promo showing mice scurrying over food and cited a fake report about a live bird living in a Florida Chipotle as recently as January.

About America's continued love of the chain, Oliver quips:

""They know it's bad and they want it even more: Chipotle is now officially America's emotionally abusive boyfriend.""

""That's harsh,"" Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a Chicago-based food research firm said about Oliver's comment. ""They shouldnt be left off the hook, but they deserve the chance to really get back on track.""

Over the weeks, Chipotle has been the target of jokes and critics alike --and rightly so.

The Food and Drug Administration reports 55 people were infected with E. Coli alone across the U.S., which resulted in 21 reported hospitalizations. The chain is now the focus of a criminal investigation by the FDA and it has been slapped with a slew of lawsuits. The latest one --this week--is from a shareholder suing Chipotle, alleging the fast food chain made false and misleading statements about its business to investors.

Chipotle isnt the only food supplier to have a major outbreak of food-poisoning. In the 1993, Jack in the Box had an E.Coli crisis stemming from undercooked beef patties. More recently, Blue Bell ice cream experienced a listeria outbreak, which forced the tubs off of store shelves. Both companies were able to fix their problems and turn their image around.

But Chipotle's marketing has centered on the idea that it makes a high quality food. These outbreaks, and Chipotles problems in tracing the source, puts that question.

As way help its tarnished image, Chipotle earlier this month closed more than 2,000 locations to get employees up to speed on changes to its food safety measures. It also announced a $10 million investment in local farmers that supply ingredients to the food company. To help build some media buzz around these efforts, chains gave away free burritos.

The give-away was ""clearly part of a much larger plan to rebuild trust with the customers,"" Bruce Hennes, managing partner of Hennes Communications, a crisis communications firm based in Cleveland, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

Just how long it will take for the company turn around public opinion is still unclear, but some experts are predicting positive growth figures as early as the end of the year.

Is that's hard to believe? Tristano says not really, given the ""overwhelming"" loyalty they have with some customer groups, especially the 18-35 male demographic.

""Our research indicates that American consumers are very forgiving with restaurant brands they are loyal to and have developed both an affinity and frequency with,"" said Tristano.

So is Chipotle America's ""emotionally abusive boyfriend?"" Sounds like for some, it's more like a relationship on the mend.","[]"

Izaha Akins, of Marion, visited Mohawk High School in December and claimed to be a lawmaker who was going to replace another senator who was planning on resigning due to an illness. Akins told the school he was second in line for the appointment after the first choice declined, according to The Toledo Blade. He also gave a speech to students.

School officials realized they were duped weeks later after Sen. David Burke, of Marysville, showed up to speak weeks later, as scheduled. Burke told the Associated Press in an email Friday that when he learned about the hoax, he and the high school immediately began working with police.

Akins told The Toledo Blade he wanted to make a point about school security in small communities.

""These country schools think it can't happen to them,"" Akins told The Blade in a brief interview. He said he wanted to ""prove a point  that these kinds of things can happen. They could easily have Googled me, and they didn't.""

School officials said Burke was scheduled to speak to a class at Jan. 14 when Akins called to tell them he was his replacement. He arranged to visit Dec. 15, provided his real name, presented his drivers license at the school that afternoon, got a tour of the school from the principal, then gave his presentation and left, Mohawk Schools Superintendent Ken Ratliff said.

""The presentation was about being active in politics, political processes,"" Ratliff said. ""Everyone thought it was legit; bought into it, including the teacher.""

Authorities said Reineke Ford provided a car and driver for the day to the supposed legislator. The Blade said Reineke Motors general manager Tony Flood said it's not unusual for the dealership to help the nearby school district.

Wyandot County Sheriff Mike Hetzel said no one at the school was in any danger, and a sheriff's deputy was at the school during the time of the visit.

Ratliff said, though, that the district now takes extra steps to verify visitors' identities.

So when I heard that Sony Pictures was about to release a faith-based film called Risen, I was a bit skeptical. Typically faith-based movies are faith-bashing movies.

Click here to get Todds American Dispatch  a must-read for conservatives.

And when Risen earned three-and-a-half stars from the left wingers at the Seattle Times, I was incredulous.

But when I saw the films trailer, I was astonished  Hollywood got it right.

Risen is a powerful telling of the aftermath of the resurrection of Jesus told from the perspective of a non-believer  a Roman military officer.

Joseph Fiennes plays Clavius, assigned to investigate the disappearance of Jesus body. Its like an old school detective noir story  think C.S.I. Jerusalem.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds interview with Risen star Joseph Fiennes.

Its a movie that sees the resurrection through the eyes of a non-believer,"" Fiennes told me. Its a wonderful, fresh way in seeing the story of Christ unfold through the eyes of a skeptic.

Fiennes is well aware of Hollywoods past attempts to bring Bible stories to the big screen. Anybody choke on their popcorn during Noah and Exodus: God and Kings?

The ever-diplomatic Fiennes did not name names, but he did refer to revisionist films that polarized a lot of people. On the other hand there are the cinephiles who took issue with preachy and conservative and low production value Christian films that did not speak to them.

Thats why Affirm Films and Sony Pictures went the extra mile to make sure they got Risen right.

We strived very hard in getting the balance between cinema and Scripture, Fiennes said. Working with the church communities in the process of making the film has allowed us to stay as true as possible to Scripture.

At the same time, they were also tasked with producing a solid work of art.

Its a film and we want people to have a great cinematic experience, Fiennes told me.

In other words  its a night at the movies  not a Sunday morning church service.

We are not selling religion or pushing religion, he said. We are pushing for great cinema and great story telling and I believe we got the balance right.

And so do many evangelical Christian leaders  most notably revered media critic Ted Baehr, chairman of the Christian Film and Television Commission.

It is a very powerful dramatic movie, Baehr said in a video posted on his website. Its a powerful heart-rending story. I recommend it for every Christian to take their friends to see Risen.

The film was also endorsed by a group of prominent Christian leaders and ministers.

Its a movie that makes you think, said Chris Williamson, pastor of Strong Tower Bible Church. Its not your typical Christian-themed movie  even though its dominated with Christian themes. If you are an atheist, a new believer, an unbeliever  I think you can find yourself in this film.

Renowned Christian leader Rick White attended a screening of the film in Tennessee. He said the film demonstrates that its okay to ask the hard questions on your spiritual journey.

Mr. Fiennes and Affirm Films and Sony Pictures have demonstrated a deep respect for the Christian faith. And in doing, so they have produced a film that will encourage and challenge and entertain a very diverse audience.

So as a fellow believer, Id like to share these words with Sony Pictures --- thank you.

He is Risen. He is Risen Indeed!

We jump out of perfectly good airplanes  something that still sets off alarms in the most veteran skydivers  and we push ourselves to the edge of death and back with physical demands on our bodies that defy reason with activities like ultra-marathons in the desert, living in microgravity, and setting the world record for holding ones breath under water.

Yet as contradictory as it sounds, testing these limits is probably what makes us feel the most human or the most attuned to nature and our own potential  particularly when it comes to soaring above the skies, jumping eight feet in the air... and eating the most bizarre, even dangerous, dishes set in front of us on the dinner table.

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","[]"

Lets review Saturdays results.

In Nevadas Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didnt connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity.

Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign cant wait to bid adieu to a February in which the candidate hasnt run so much as shes lurched.

Pre-Nevada, Hillarys national lead over Sanders evaporated. Showing none of the certainty of a repeat presidential candidate, Clinton has fiddled with her core message (Im a progressive who likes to get things done) with the same frequency that she changed hairstyles back in the 1990s.

The bottom line: despite winning Nevada, Clintons long-term prospects remain shaky.

And that should elate conservatives.

Now, for the appalling: a Republican primary in South Carolina that had little do with conservative principles, ideas or values.

The complaint here isnt that Donald Trump won. Or, that his dominance again defies common sense: only a single-digit number of South Carolinians told exit pollsters that Trump shares their values; the twice-divorced candidate split the evangelical vote with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

The concern: the nature of how Trump goes about his business  the king of noisy bandwidth, his bombast and calculated fights for months now have dominated news cycles, streamed ceaselessly on social media, and stifled any chance at a calm, rational, issues-driven conversation on the Republican slide.

South Carolina was yet another casualty. The primary was an opportunity to discuss what exactly the conservative movement embodies these days. Now, the moments passed.

To the need to broadening the partys appeal to win national elections, there was a chance to showcase Gov. Nikki Haley (the nations only female Indian-American head of state) and Sen. Tim Scott (one of only two African-American senators).

Both supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dominated the exit-poll electability question. Both played cameos roles compared to the candidates infighting.

South Carolina leads the nation in direct foreign investment and has a veteran population 25 percent larger than the national average. Last year, the state dealt gracefully with three divisive issues: lowering the Confederate flag at the state Capitol; a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston that led to an outpouring of calm, not violence; the fatal police shooting of black man in North Charleston that likewise didnt turn into urban riots.

So where was the conversation regarding growing the economy, the perils of union over-reach (West Virginia, like South Carolina, becoming a right-to-work state this past week), a more coherent foreign policy and a more united society across racial and ideological lines?

The answer: they all were smothered by Trumps antics  and a malady best described as Candidate Derangement Syndrome.

During the course of the GOPs 10-day road trip down south, Trump threatened to sue Cruz over an ad claiming the GOP frontrunner once supported abortion rights. Trump went mano-a-mitre with Pope Francis over building a border wall. He blamed George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks, insinuating that the former president lied his way into the Iraq invasion. Trump even called for a boycott of Apple products so long as the computer refuses to hack into a dead terrorists iPhone.

The media ate it up.

Not surprisingly, the primary played into the stereotype of South Carolina as a political circus.

In fairness, Trumps not the only offender here. Cruz and Rubio spit-balled each other over character flaws, policy inconsistencies and sloppy photo-shopping. Jeb Bush went after Trump in defense of his big brother and in vain hopes of jump-starting a campaign that ended not long after the polls closed.

The question moving forward for conservatives: is this the way its going to be until someone earns 1,237 delegates and the partys nomination?

With three primaries down and another 17 Republican contests to be held over the course of the next two weeks, look for the following dominos to tumble.

Bush. Theres a saying in Silicon Valley: WFIO. It stands for Were F---ed, Its Over.

Credit Jeb Bush with recognizing in an instant that his campaign was over. His concession speech was dignified and without a trace of bitterness  rarities in this age of harsh politics. Other candidates whod spend nearly $81 million in ads ($15 million in South Carolina) with only four delegates to show night not have been so graceful.

Now, the political question: how quickly does Bush throw his organizational and financial weight behind Rubio? Its a good question, as relations between the Floridians are strained, but nowhere near Bushs animosity for Trump.

Rubio. As was the case after his third-place finish in Iowa, opportunity knocks. So how does Rubio capitalize on newfound moment? Look for an infusion of cash and a spate of endorsements. Rubios priorities in the weeks ahead: amassing delegates on March 1 (much easier now that Bush is out of the race), winning Florida on March 15.

Meanwhile, circle this date: Feb. 25. Its the next GOP candidates debate  University of Houston, CNN and Telemundo moderating. And its Rubios next chance to shine as the establishments alternative to Trump and Cruz.

Cruz. Six March 1 states line up as targets for Cruz  Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and his home state of Texas. For Cruz, the goal is to stay close to Trump by winning as many delegates as possible in these winner-takes-most states that allot the delegates proportionally.

The key figure for Cruz and Rubio, presuming Trump continues to run in the low- to mid-30s: 20 percent, which is the threshold required in most states in order to earn delegates.

Trump. Yes, he won. Decisively so.

But as the attention focuses on three candidates, does Trumps share of the pie expand? Trumps support so far: 24.3 percent in Iowa; 35.3 percent in New Hampshire; 33 percent in South Carolina.

For those who see Trump as a media-savvier version of Pat Buchanans insurrection back in 1992, this reminder: Buchanan peaked at 37.5 percent in New Hampshire; he then had trouble cracking 30 percent. The protest movement had a ceiling.

Unlike Buchanans run, Trump is actually winning states. Whether he can get to 40 percent and beyond: its the difference between a race that could be over by Easter Sunday or an unsettled national convention in July.

With the Republican race staying in the South through March 1, perhaps its best to remember a NASCAR adage about the pushing and shoving and fender-bending that occurs along the speedway: rubbings racing.

Thats true in this Republican field, even if the process rubs conservatives the wrong way.

But stretching? The Los Angeles Angels right-hander hated and avoided it. And Weaver is convinced the ensuring stiffness and loss of flexibility led to a steady decline that bottomed out in his painful and poor 2015 season.

''Last year it was just pitching with competitiveness. It was going out there kind of naked, to tell you the truth,'' Weaver said Sunday. ''But I was going to go out there and take the ball. I was able to keep us in the game sometimes. At other times it was pretty frustrating and embarrassing.''

The three-time All-Star saw his fastball velocity decline for a third straight year into the mid-80s mph, according to FanGraphs. He finished 7-12, the first losing record of his career and the first time he hadn't reached 10 wins. His 4.64 ERA was a career-worst, his 90 strikeouts a career-low and he threw only 159 innings.

''Well, '13 is when the decline started happening,'' the 33-year-old Weaver said. ''I started feeling stuff tightening up through that season and kind of fell off going into '14 and obviously last year. Ten or 11 years of bad maintenance as far as stretching goes has caught up to me.''

Weaver spent the offseason in what he called ''pain and agony'' as he learned how to stretch again in lengthy sessions. Now his hip no longer hurts when he sits up in bed. He's no longer feel dull pain when he walks. He says he's ''five times'' better than last year.

''The other day I woke up and I said, `Man, this is how your body is supposed to feel?''' Weaver said.

But can an offseason fixing his body make up for for years of neglect?

''I hope so,'' Weaver said. ''I've only got one more year to figure it out, right?''

Indeed, Weaver enters the final year of his contract. He'll make $20 million this season, ace money, even though he's no longer the No. 1. With the club's payroll nearing the luxury tax threshold and Weaver's production declining, he knows this could be his final season in Anaheim.

''I've given everything I have to this organization. But I'm not stupid,'' Weaver said. ''I know that business becomes part of the game at some point. Whether the Angels want to keep me around, I can't say I didn't have a blast here.

''But I've still got one year left and my focus is getting myself to where we can be, and that's the World Series.''

Manager Mike Scioscia needs an effective Weaver to help improve on an 85-win season that left the Angels out of the 2015 playoffs. He believes Weaver looks ''real good'' so far.

But Scioscia said there's a long way to go to see if Weaver can return to near the level that saw him record 223 strikeouts in 2010, post a 2.41 ERA a year later and a 20-5 record in 2012.

''There's no adrenaline. He's not out there trying to throw 92 mph,'' Scioscia said. ''But as far as his delivery and the ball coming out, (catching coach) Steve Soliz was raving about that he has that easy velocity again. We'll see where he is.''

Weaver thinks his ''lankiness'' is back. His range of motion has improved dramatically. He's pain-free, stretching for up to an hour every day and wants to pitch past 2016.

He'd like to stay with the Angels, too, but acknowledged he must get better or he may not have much of a future anywhere.

''It's no secret, obviously, it's the last year of my contract,'' Weaver said. ''Who knows what happens after this? I'd like to play for as long as I can. But if I go through another season like last year, not just the frustration of the numbers, but jus as my body felt, your heart and mind can only do so much.''","[]"

For the small study, researchers from the University College London analyzed the real-time brain activity of 13 volunteers as they completed visual tasks while sounds played in the background. As the tasks got harder, the brains response to sound was reduced.

The brain scans showed that people were not only ignoring or filtering out the sounds, they were not actually hearing them in the first place,  study co-author Maria Chait, PhD, explained in a press release. These findings suggest that our vision and our hearing share limited resources in the brain, which is essentially forced to choose between processing info from our eyes or our ears.

Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has made another gaffe, saying AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli has ''taken too much sun.''

Berlusconi, who described U.S. President Barack Obama as ''tanned'' in 2008 and 2009, was discussing his wish for an all-Italian Milan team. He then joked that Italy forward Balotelli, who is black, ''is also Italian even if he has taken too much sun.''

Despite his pleas for a high profile matchup, he's been passed over time and time again while just itching to work a more active schedule and face some elite fighters at 185 pounds to prove the hype surrounding this middleweight prospect is for real.

As disappointing as it's been to see other fighters land those marquee matchups, Brunson admits he's had to start getting used to it because there don't seem to be a lot of top 10 guys clamoring to fight him.

""It's one of those things I've become accustomed to. I don't think too many guys are raising their hands trying to fight me,"" Brunson told FOX Sports. ""I think for 2016, it's about staying active no matter what. In 2014 and 2015, I fought twice (each year) and I was healthy. That's not enough, that's not cutting it. I've been asking for short notice fights.

""Like for instance the fight with Uriah Hall and Robert Whittaker. I was asking for that fight but I didn't get it.""

Most recently, Brunson targeted fights with Michael Bisping and/or Lyoto Machida as potential opponents, but he didn't land either one. Despite his pleas for a ranked middleweight, Brunson finally got tired of waiting and just hoped to get any fight so he could return to action after several months off.

""At that point, I really didn't care,"" Brunson said. ""It was at the point of staying active and getting whoever was available. I was asking for a lot of guys like (Lyoto) Machida, (Michael) Bisping, but they had plans for those guys as far as fights. So nothing else was really available and Roan Carneiro was kind of sitting around.""

Carneiro returned to the UFC a year ago after spending several fights with the promotion as a welterweight prior to his release.

In his first fight back while now competing as a middleweight, Carneiro made short work of Mark Munoz in a very impressive outing. Brunson knows that Carneiro can definitely be a dangerous opponent if he allows him to use his best weapon in the Octagon.

Then again, Brunson is also aware that if he fights to the best of his ability, Carneiro won't make it until the final bell.

""Obviously, you've got to go out there and focus on each fight before moving onto the next one. Carneiro, it could be one of the easiest fights I've had or one of the hardest, it just depends on what he presents on the ground,"" Brunson said. ""He's probably one of the better guys in the UFC when it comes to jiu-jitsu. His jiu-jitsu game is definitely there. I'm looking for some premiere matchups after this one.""

With a co-main event in Pittsburgh this Sunday night in a fight that airs live on FS1 starting at 9pm ET, Brunson not only wants to win but he wants to send a message to the rest of the middleweight division.

The top 10 fighters can't avoid him forever and Brunson promises that any of them that finally accept his offer will find how he's finished his last two opponents with devastating TKO's.

""Honestly, I think I can finish anybody like that in the UFC,"" Brunson said. ""Now we've got all this enhanced testing, guys are getting popped for trying to be slick and do PED's, (performance enhancing drugs) yeah I'm confident I can put any guy away. It's just a matter of finding an opening and exploiting it.

""I feel I present a bad matchup for everyone in the division. I match up against everybody well. I just have to stay consistent and keep going out there winning fights.""","[]"

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector that transmits the Zika virus, and also dengue and chikunguna. The Food and Drug Administration is recommending U.S. blood banks refuse donations from people who have traveled to countries where the Zika virus is active in the prior four weeks, part of guidelines meant to protect the blood supply from the mosquito-borne virus. (AP Photo/Ricardo Mazalan, File)

Top House Republicans said Thursday that the fastest way for President to obtain money to combat the spread of the Zika virus is to tap leftover funding from the 2014 battle against Ebola.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers and other senior panel members told the White House budget chief Shaun Donovan that there's plenty of unspent anti-Ebola funding to cover the $1.8 billion Obama seeks to fight Zika. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said earlier this month that the administration wants to retain Ebola funds to ""finish the job in terms of Ebola.""

The letter from Appropriations Chairman Rogers identified $2.7 billion in ""unobligated"" Ebola funds at HHS, the State Department and in foreign aid accounts.

""If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible, it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola response, prevention, and preparedness,"" Rogers wrote. ""These funds can and should be prioritized to meet the most pressing needs of mounting a rapid and full response to Zika.""

Rogers added that he would consider replacing the Ebola money that would be tapped to fight Zika if circumstances warrant.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said earlier this month that any Zika money should be ""offset"" with cuts elsewhere. The Ebola money at issue was deemed emergency funding and was not provided on the basis that it be paid for by other budget cuts.

Voters' fears regarding Ebola were seen as hurting Obama's party in the 2014 midterm landslide.

The Zika virus is feared to cause severe birth defects in unborn children and is spreading through Brazil and other countries in the Americas. There has been no transmission of the virus by mosquitoes within the U.S., but travelers have returned with the infection.","[]"

The fifth generation of the Gordon family has resumed the legacy of the Conde de Mirasol (Count of Mirasol) brand in manufacturing extra virgin olive oil collected by hand and squeezed with the latest technology using the first crop from centuries-old olive trees from the ""Spanish Sicily"" region.

On Saturday, in the heart of Spain's southern Cordovan Subbetica region, the family oil presses on Cervantes St., in the center of the town of Rute and which will soon be turned into a museum, were turning out an extra-fine virgin ""hojiblanco"" olive oil.

But this is not just any liquid gold, according to Brigida Jimenez - a doctor of pharmacy and director of the Agrarian and Fishing Research and Training Institute, or IFAPA, in the nearby town of Cabra. Rather, it is an olive oil that has ""all the organoleptic and nutritional qualities"" of the meat of the olives, including Vitamins D and E.

The oil can only be had by collecting the olives when they first mature, when the oil content and quality is at its optimum.

But the careful processing continues with manual pruning and packing into small boxes ""so that the fruit isn't damaged or crushed"" - and the key is in the stirring and final grinding, with the oil paste being centrifuged separately for just a short time so that the oil retains all its aromas.

The Count of Mirasol himself, Alfonso Gordon, the fourth-generation owner of this olive oil industry jewel, said that it is ""extremely important"" to him that his son has joined the traditional industry since leaving his career five years ago to return to the country and develop an ambitious project with a coveted goal: ""to make ourselves into the world's best 'hojiblanco' (olive oil production operation).""

The Molino Nuevo olive oil press in Rute produced an abundance of oil back in 1805, and five years ago Alfonso Gordon Jr. shelved his former career to make the leap into the olive oil industry using the 15,000 olive trees - many of them hundreds of years old - on the family farm near Cordoba, in Spain's southern Andalusia region, the soil and climate of which have made it known as ""Spanish Sicily.""

Conde de Mirasol also works to market its oil abroad, and the product has been well-received in Japan, where it has competed in contests in the sector.

The United States, Germany and Israel are other countries where the oil will be promoted in international competitions.

The secret of success? ""The experience of generations and the best machinery and techniques,"" which combine to create ""the formula for producing the world's best olive oil,"" says Gordon. EFE","[]"

The discussion of a foreign national working with the U.S. government raises security implications  an executive order signed by President Obama said such unauthorized disclosures are presumed to cause damage to the national security.""

The U.S. government official said the Clinton email exchange, which referred to a New York Times report, was among 29 classified emails recently provided to congressional committees with specific clearances to review them. In that batch were 22 top secret exchanges deemed too damaging to national security to release.

Confirmation that one of these exchanges concerned a reported CIA asset means the emails went beyond issues like the drone strike campaign. Democrats repeatedly have said some messages referred to this, reinforcing Clinton's position that the documents are over-classified.

Based on the timing and other details, the email chain likely refers to either an October 2009 Times story that identified Afghan national Ahmed Wali Karzai, the half-brother of then-Afghan president Hamid Karzai, as a person who received regular payments from the Central Intelligence Agency -- or an August 2010 Times story that identified Karzai aide Mohammed Zia Salehi as being on the CIA payroll. Ahmed Wali Karzai was murdered during a 2011 shoot-out, a killing later claimed by the Taliban.

Fox News was told the email chain included then-Secretary of State Clinton and then-special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke and possibly others. The basic details of this email exchange were backed up to Fox News by a separate U.S. government source who was not authorized to speak on the record.

Its unclear who initiated the discussion  Clinton, Holbrooke or a subordinate  or whether the CIA's relationship with the Afghan national was confirmed, because the classified documents are not public.

Holbrooke died in December 2010, during his service as a special envoy.

A CIA spokesperson told Fox News they had no comment on the email chain.

A spokeswoman for the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General also had no comment.

The U.S. government official's account of the Clinton email chain dovetails with a Feb. 3 interview on Fox News America's Newsroom, where Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, a member of the House intelligence committee, said, ""I have never read anything more sensitive than what these emails contain. They do reveal classified methods. They do reveal classified sources and they do reveal human assets.""

Stewart added, ""I can't imagine how anyone could be familiar with these emails, whether they're sending them or receiving them, and not realize that these are highly classified.""

While the Clinton campaign claims the government classification review has gone too far, Executive Order 13526, in a section called ""classification standards, says, ""the unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.""

Fox News was first to report that the Clinton emails contained intelligence beyond top secret, and some of the information was deemed ""HCS-O""  a code that refers to human intelligence from ongoing operations.

National security and intelligence experts emphasized to Fox News that security clearance holders are trained to not confirm or deny details of a classified program in an unclassified setting, which would include a personal unsecured email network, even if the classified program appears in press reports.

The rules of handling classified information dictate if something is reported in open source [news reports] you dont confirm it because its still classified information, said Dan Maguire, who spent more than four decades handling highly classified programs and specialized in human intelligence operations.

As secretary of state, Clinton signed at least two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) on Jan. 22, 2009, and received a briefing from a security officer whose identity was redacted. As part of the NDA for sensitive compartmented information (SCI), Clinton acknowledged any breach could result in termination of my access to SCI and removal from a position of special confidence and trust requiring such access as well as the termination of my employment or any other relationships with any Department or Agency that provides me with access to SCI.""

It is remains unclear how classified materials jumped the gap from a classified system to her personal server.

On Feb. 12, Clintons national press secretary Brian Fallon emphasized that classified information would have been marked as such. I think when this review plays itself out, at the end theyll find that what we have said is true, he told CNN. Nothing was marked classified at the time it was sent.

Fallon also attacked the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, for what he described as fishing expedition-style investigations since Clinton decided to run for president. There is no basis. It is intended to create headwinds for her campaign, but it is not going to work, Fallon said. He leveled a similar allegation against Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough, III, after his office notified Congress the emails contained information beyond top secret.

Inquiries by Fox News to Clinton's attorney David Kendall about the status of or changes to her security clearance, and access to classified information, have not been returned.

So when I heard that Sony Pictures was about to release a faith-based film called Risen, I was a bit skeptical. Typically faith-based movies are faith-bashing movies.

Click here to get Todds American Dispatch  a must-read for conservatives.

And when Risen earned three-and-a-half stars from the left wingers at the Seattle Times, I was incredulous.

But when I saw the films trailer, I was astonished  Hollywood got it right.

Risen is a powerful telling of the aftermath of the resurrection of Jesus told from the perspective of a non-believer  a Roman military officer.

Joseph Fiennes plays Clavius, assigned to investigate the disappearance of Jesus body. Its like an old school detective noir story  think C.S.I. Jerusalem.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds interview with Risen star Joseph Fiennes.

Its a movie that sees the resurrection through the eyes of a non-believer,"" Fiennes told me. Its a wonderful, fresh way in seeing the story of Christ unfold through the eyes of a skeptic.

Fiennes is well aware of Hollywoods past attempts to bring Bible stories to the big screen. Anybody choke on their popcorn during Noah and Exodus: God and Kings?

The ever-diplomatic Fiennes did not name names, but he did refer to revisionist films that polarized a lot of people. On the other hand there are the cinephiles who took issue with preachy and conservative and low production value Christian films that did not speak to them.

Thats why Affirm Films and Sony Pictures went the extra mile to make sure they got Risen right.

We strived very hard in getting the balance between cinema and Scripture, Fiennes said. Working with the church communities in the process of making the film has allowed us to stay as true as possible to Scripture.

At the same time, they were also tasked with producing a solid work of art.

Its a film and we want people to have a great cinematic experience, Fiennes told me.

In other words  its a night at the movies  not a Sunday morning church service.

We are not selling religion or pushing religion, he said. We are pushing for great cinema and great story telling and I believe we got the balance right.

And so do many evangelical Christian leaders  most notably revered media critic Ted Baehr, chairman of the Christian Film and Television Commission.

It is a very powerful dramatic movie, Baehr said in a video posted on his website. Its a powerful heart-rending story. I recommend it for every Christian to take their friends to see Risen.

The film was also endorsed by a group of prominent Christian leaders and ministers.

Its a movie that makes you think, said Chris Williamson, pastor of Strong Tower Bible Church. Its not your typical Christian-themed movie  even though its dominated with Christian themes. If you are an atheist, a new believer, an unbeliever  I think you can find yourself in this film.

Renowned Christian leader Rick White attended a screening of the film in Tennessee. He said the film demonstrates that its okay to ask the hard questions on your spiritual journey.

Mr. Fiennes and Affirm Films and Sony Pictures have demonstrated a deep respect for the Christian faith. And in doing, so they have produced a film that will encourage and challenge and entertain a very diverse audience.

So as a fellow believer, Id like to share these words with Sony Pictures --- thank you.

He is Risen. He is Risen Indeed!

A 45-year-old man was arrested early Sunday in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt after the shootings began early Saturday evening, authorities said.

Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. outside the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where a woman was shot multiple times and seriously wounded.

A little more than four hours later and 15 miles away, a father and son were fatally shot while looking at cars at the dealership. Fifteen minutes after that, five people, including the teenager, were gunned down in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant along Interstate 94, Matyas said.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas said the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said early Sunday.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery.

Crystal City residents dont have any water they can drink. Black water came out of the pipes in homes in the tiny city where the sweeping bribery and conspiracy indictments brought down city leaders. Volunteers handed out donated bottles of water on Friday, as state environmental officials test the water for bacteria.

Joel Barajas  the only City Council member not facing criminal charges  told the San Antonio Express-News that he was grateful to residents elsewhere in the region who donated water. The city has blamed the water problem on dirt and mud build up in a water tank that was flushed, the newspaper reported.

""There are caring people in Southwest Texas,"" said Barajas, who has been thrust into being the point person for all of the city's departments.

Residents told Fox San Antonio Thursday they werent warned that the water tank was going to be flushed and were surprised of what was coming out of their faucets.

""It smelled as soon as I turned on the water we were getting ready for showers and I smelled it and then I started getting the text from my friends 'hey is this happening at your house look what's going on at mine,"" a woman identified only as Nora told Fox San Antonio.

""We didn't get a warning; we didn't get a warning that this was going to happen,"" she said.

And to add even more to the town's woes, the Texas Education Agency said Friday that the local school district could lose its accreditation after failing to meet state standards for the third straight year.

Crystal City leaders were charged with taking bribes from contractors and sending city workers to help an illegal gambling operator, according to a federal indictment released earlier this month. Another councilman is facing unrelated allegations that he helped smuggle Mexican immigrants into the U.S.

Mayor Ricardo Lopez resigned Friday afternoon, just days after he was arrested during a City Council meeting following a scuffle with an angry audience member  in full view of television cameras. That meeting was held to schedule a recall vote for Lopez and two City Council members.

I feel bad talking about the little town where I grew up, but this is ridiculous,"" Alicia Martinez told the Associated Press, 33. ""We need help to get it back to where it used to be.""

Both are victims of a left-wing smear machine","['Fred Fleitz']","This week, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) named my organization, the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a hate group because of our work highlighting the threat from radical Islam. CSP will join other conservative groups such the Family Research Council, Liberty Counsel and WorldNetDaily, all of which SPLC has smeared by listing them alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.

The SPLC is best known for its work decades ago fighting legal battles against segregation in the South. But it long ago morphed into a far left group with one purpose: manufacturing material to slander conservatives for use by the news media and on the Internet.

CSP President Frank Gaffney has been on another SPLC hate list for several years along with American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), Robert Spencer (the founder of director of Jihad Watch blog), Lt. Gen. William Jerry Boykin (executive vice president of the Family Research Council), WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah and other conservatives. Joining them on this list are an assortment of neo-Nazis, KKK members and white supremacists.

Dr. Ben Carson was placed on a SPLC extremist watch list in 2014 because of statements he made in defense of traditional marriage. But after a public outcry, the SPLC was forced to withdraw this designation and issue an apology to Carson in February 2015.

Among the many false claims in the SPLCs new list of hate groups is that Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy have been banned from participating in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and that Gaffneys banishment from CPAC probably earns him points with Trump.

Although CPAC and the Center have had some differences in the past, this is no longer the case. Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC last year and will have an expanded presence in 2016.

I will be speaking at CPAC 2016 conference next month on behalf of the Center on the Iranian and North Korean missile programs.

To show how sloppy the SPLCs research is, a 2015 SPLC report noted that Gaffney and the Center were present at CPACs 2015 conference and that the Center was a sponsor.

As ridiculous as the SPLC hate lists may sound, they often are taken seriously by the liberal media. These lists almost had deadly consequences in 2012 when Floyd Corkins, a volunteer at a gay-rights group, entered the office lobby of the Family Research Council with the intention of killing as many of the Councils employees as possible because of the organizations opposition to same-sex marriage.

Corkins shot and injured a building manager before he was disarmed. He decided to launch a killing spree against the Family Research Council and another conservative organization after he read about their opposition to gay marriage in the SPLCs hate lists.

While SPLC regularly lumps conservatives with neo-nazis and white supremacists for being anti-gay, anti-immigrant, Islamophobes, white nationalists or for miscellaneous hate (such disbelieving in global warming), it refuses to put liberal individuals and groups on their hate lists.

For example, the SPLC had nothing to say last summer when left wing groups like MoveOn.org, the Daily Kos, Credo and the National Iranian American Council attacked Jewish congressmen who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) by questioning their loyalty to this country.

Elliot Abrams decried this bigotry in an August 10, 2015 article in The Weekly Standard:

The basic idea is simple: to oppose the presidents Iran deal means you want war with Iran, youre an Israeli agent, you are in the pay of Jewish donors, and you are abandoning the best interests of the United States. So Dan Pfeiffer, senior political adviser to Obama until this winter, tweeted that Senator Charles Schumerwho announced his opposition to the Iran deal last weekshould not be Democratic leader in the Senate because he wants War with Iran.

SPLC also has been silent on a growing anti-Semitism on the left and how American colleges are ignoring violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States.

On the other hand, the SPLC has joined President Obama in jumping on the fraudulent Islamophobia bandwagon. Thats why CSP and Gaffney caught its attention.

I join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group.

The Islamophobia charges made against CSP and other critics of radical Islam have nothing to do with hate or bigotry  they are a ploy by Mr. Obama, American Muslim groups and liberal groups to sidestep how Islamist extremism represents, as American Islamic Forum for Democracy President Zuhdi Jasser has put it, a problem within the house of Islam.

This problem is the global jihad movement which is an ideology at war not just with modern society but also with the majority of the worlds Muslims.

This is the real hate: Islamic supremacists cloaking their intolerance and hatred towards anyone who rejects their extremism  Muslims and non-Muslims  as protected religious practice. This hate includes brutalizing and killing groups that the SPLC claims to protect: women, LGBT individuals and racial and ethnic minorities.

The SPLC designated Frank Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy as haters because of our work to publicize the threat posed by to the supremacist Islamic shariah doctrine, a threat that President Obama and liberal groups refuse to confront or even name. They are in denial about this threat and instead condemn as bigots anyone who tries to address it.

This was crystal clear when President Obama on February 3 visited a mosque in Baltimore with known terrorist ties but refuses to meet with Muslims like Dr. Jasser who is leading an Islam reform movement that rejects Islamist radicalism and ISIS.

American leftwing groups like SPLC have also stubbornly ignored flagrantly hateful statements by some American Muslim groups.

There was a glaring example of this after the San Bernardino shooting when Hussam Ayloush, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told CNNs New Day, some of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism. ... We are partly responsible.

In May 2004, Ayloush said the U.S. war on terror was a war on Muslims, adding his belief that the 9/11 attacks were committed because of the U.S.s unconditional support of Israel. The U.S. is Israels partner in crime against the Palestinians, Ayloush explained.

How can a supposed civil rights organization like the SPLC give Ayloush and CAIR a pass on such hateful statements and actions?

How can it not speak out against growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States?

One reason is that the SPLC is not a civil rights organization  it is a far left advocacy group that tries to discredit its political enemies on the right with incoherent hate lists that wrongly associate them with notorious bigots to advance a liberal agenda. This is consistent with #12 of Saul Alinskys ""Rules for Radicals"": Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.

SPLC also demonized conservatives with bogus hate charges because it has found this kind of fearmongering to be very lucrative. According to the SPLCs 2014 tax return, this non-profit organization had $54 million in revenue and $315 million in assets.

Back in 2000, an investigative report into the SPLCs activities was published by Harpers Magazine titled The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance. It described the SPLC and its activities as essentially a fraud that shuts down debate, stifles free speech, and most of all, raises a pile of money, very little of which is used on behalf of poor people.

Perhaps the main reason the SPLC has been able to raise such huge sums because its president, Morris Dees, is so skilled at using scare mongering mailings for fund raising that in 1998 he was inducted into the Direct Mailing Association Hall of Fame.

Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.

The author of this article asked, What I'm very curious to learn is how keeping hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in assets, several offshore bank accounts and part ownership in foreign financial firms in any substantive way addresses poverty in America.

I believe the SPLCs new focus on Islamophobia is because the organization has identified attacking critics of radical Islam as the ultimate money pot. For example, Saleh Abdulla Kamel, a Saudi banker believed to have been a financer of Usama bin Laden, gave $10 million to Yale University in 2015 to build an Islamic law center.

Given the SPLCs lack of scruples, greed and offshore operations, I believe it is very likely that this group is receiving funding from Gulf state billionaires like Kamel to discredit anyone who criticizes radical Islam and the global jihad movement.

The news media must stop being manipulated by the SPLCs calumny of its political enemies.

Reporters should realize that an organization which attacks all critics of radical Islam as Islamophobes, refuses to mention the extremism and intolerance of radical Islamist groups, and is silent on the growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish university students cannot be considered a neutral and authoritative source.

The media also needs recognize that the SPLCs hate lists which lump Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney, Cliff Kinkaid and organizations like the Family Resource Council, WorldNet Daily and the Center for Security Policy with neo-Nazis and white supremacists are utter nonsense.

The press should instead be investigating the SPLCs enormous wealth, anonymous funders and how it is poisoning the public debate in this country to advance a liberal agenda and to enrich itself.

The report, based on a national survey done by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that 18 percent of American adults said they visited the ER at least once in 2014, and about 6.5 percent said they visited the ER two or more times.

Women were more likely than men to make an ER visit; about 20 percent of women said they went to the ER, compared with 16 percent of men.

Young people were also slightly more likely to end up in the ER. In 2014, 20 percent of people ages 18 to 29 said they visited the ER at least once, compared to 17 percent of people ages 30 to 44, and 17.5 percent of people ages 45 to 64.

Of adults who went to the ER, most (77 percent) said they went because of the seriousness of their medical problems. However, 12 percent said they went because their doctor's office wasn't open, and 7 percent went because they didn't have access to other health care providers, the report said.

In the past, researchers have found differences in ER use depending on the type of insurance that people have; those with private insurance are less likely to visit the ER than are people with Medicaid or people who are uninsured. Because nearly 8 million people gained health insurance between 2013 and 2014 as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the researchers also looked to see whether there were changes in ER visits during this period.

They found that, overall, ER use among adults did not change between 2013 and 2014. But the percentage of adults who visited the ER two or more times dropped slightly, from 8 percent to 6 percent. [7 Facts You Should Know About Health Care Reform]

However, there were still differences in ER use depending on insurance type. In 2014, about 14 percent of adults with private insurance visited the ER, compared to 35 percent of adults on Medicaid and 16.5 percent of adults without insurance.

""The findings indicate that, so far, there have been no changes over time [in ER visits], and disparities between groups persist,"" the researchers said. More research on ER visits could help identify ways to reduce inappropriate ER use, they said.

The high use of the ER among adults who are on Medicaid may be because this population is generally in poorer health than are people with private insurance or those who are uninsured, the researchers said. Adults on Medicaid were the most likely to say that their ER visit was due to the seriousness of their medical problems, compared to people with private insurance or people without insurance, the report said.

The report is published Feb. 18 as a CDC National Health Statistics Report.

Over the past 18 years, the U.K.'s Environment Agency has used a technology called lidar to collect data for more than 72 percent of England's surface. This remote sensing technique bounces laser light beams off the ground to make 3D terrain maps that can peer below vegetation and reveal the contours of every ditch and boulder below.

The U.K.'s lidar maps were used primarily for environmental purposes, such as for planning flood defenses or tracking eroding coastlines. But last summer, the agency dumped all 11TB of its data sets onto the Survey Open Data website. [Roman Fort: See Images of the Long-Lost Discoveries]

The maps grabbed the attention of archaeologists and history buffs among them, David Ratledge, a 70-year-old retired road engineer who has spent nearly five decades searching for ancient Roman roads, The Times of London reported.

After the Romans invaded Britain in the first century A.D., they built an impressive network of roads to secure their occupation. You can walk in the footsteps of Roman soldiers on a few surviving sections of these ancient highways today, but many routes have been stripped of their stones or they have been obscured by development and farmland.

These ""lost"" roads left some gaps in the history of Roman Britain. One mystery for Ratledge was, how did the Romans get from Ribchester to Lancaster? With access to the new maps, Ratledge thinks he has solved the puzzle. He traced an 11-mile road from Ribchester to the main north-south road at Catterall that then led to Lancaster.

""The road takes a very logical and economical route to join the main north-south road at Catterall and hence on to Lancaster,"" Ratledge wrote on the website of the Roman Roads Research Association. ""Years of looking for a road via Priest Hill, White Chapel, Beacon Fell, Oakenclough and Street proved to be time spent in the wrong place!""

Ratledge said a prominent stretch of a Roman rampart is even visible in Google Street View.

""How nobody me included spotted it is a mystery,"" he wrote.

Archaeologists Hugh Toller and Bryn Gethin have also used the lidar data to find four other roads, including a missing part of a Roman road called the Maiden Way, the U.K. Environment Agency said in a statement.

First developed in the 1960s, lidar has a variety of uses. In one of its best-known early applications, it helped NASA's astronauts study the surface of the moon during the Apollo missions. Today, it's been used to survey land for oil and gas companies, or to assess the damage of a disaster like the 2010 Haiti earthquake or Hurricane Sandy. It's even been used in an artistic capacity, to make haunting portraits of people in Ethiopia.

The technique has also become a useful tool for archaeologists who want to look for buried structures without breaking ground. In recent years, archaeologists have used lidar to discover the foundations of a lost city in the Honduran rainforest, mapped the sprawling ancient city of Angkor in Cambodia and revealed lost historic sites across New England.

In England, archaeologists aren't the only ones interested in the Environment Agency's terrain maps. The agency said utility companies might use the data to plan the construction of new infrastructure, and winemakers might even find the lidar maps useful when scouting potential plots for vineyards. ""Minecraft"" players have also requested the data sets to help them build virtual worlds.

When it runs out of plausible excuses for its appeasement-plus policy on Iran, the Obama administration advances one argument as final line of defense: showing goodwill toward the Islamic Republic would help moderates secure a greater share of power in Tehran with the hope of an eventual change of behavior by the ruling mullahs.

Wishful thinking or not, a test of that theory is coming on Friday as the Islamic Republic holds elections for the Islamic Majlis, the 290-seat ersatz parliament, and the Assembly of Experts, a body of 88 mullahs supposed to keep an eye on the Supreme Guide.

The Hubble space telescope has captured an incredible image of elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, which is located in the Coma Cluster. Scientists, however, note that the giant galaxy harbors a dark secret.

The European Space Agency explains that the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole that has 21 billion times the mass of the Sun and an event horizon  the surface at which even light cannot escape its gravitational grasp  of approximately 81 billion miles. That makes the event horizon about 15 times the diameter of Neptunes orbit from the Sun.

However, the black holes time of swallowing stars and devouring dust is past. Astronomers believe that the gigantic black hole has stopped feeding, and is currently resting after feasting on NGC 4889s cosmic cuisine, explained the ESA, in a statement on its website. The environment within the galaxy is now so peaceful that stars are forming from its remaining gas and orbiting undisturbed around the black hole.

Scientists explain that, when it was active, NGC 4889s supermassive black hole was fuelled by a process known as hot accretion. When galactic material  such as gas, dust and other debris  slowly fell inwards towards the black hole, it accumulated and formed an accretion disc, they said. Orbiting the black hole, this spinning disc of material was accelerated by the black holes immense gravitational pull and heated to millions of degrees. This heated material also expelled gigantic and very energetic jets.

During its active period, astronomers would have classified NGC 4889 as a quasar, according to the agency, with the disk around the supermassive black hole emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way.

The ESA notes that, although it is impossible to directly observe a black hole  as light cannot escape its gravitational pull  its mass can be indirectly determined. Using instruments on the Keck II Observatory and Gemini North Telescope, astronomers measured the velocity of the stars moving around NGC 4889s centre, it explained. These velocities  which depend on the mass of the object they orbit  revealed the immense mass of the supermassive black hole.

The Hubble space telescope, which was launched by NASA in 1990, celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.

In 2015 astronomers used three telescopes, including the Hubble to spot a baby blue galaxy that is farther away in space than any other galaxy ever seen. The galaxy, named EGS-zs8-1, is 13.1 billion light-years away.

In October the telescope also captured a stunning image of a faraway galaxy known as a barred spiral.

Continue Reading Below

The Commerce Department said on Monday the unchanged reading in consumer spending followed an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in November. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent gain in November.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edging up 0.1 percent in December after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in November.

Consumer spending increased 3.4 percent in 2015 after advancing 4.2 percent in 2014.

That data was included in last Friday's fourth-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending slowed to a 2.2 percent annual rate from the third quarter's brisk 3 percent pace.

Moderate consumer spending, weak export growth and ongoing efforts by businesses to reduce unsold merchandise piled up in warehouses helped restrict economic growth to a 0.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter. More cutbacks in investment by energy firms struggling with lower oil prices also hurt GDP growth.

In December, income rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in November. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in November. Income in 2015 increased

4.5 percent, the largest increase since 2012, after rising 4.4 percent in 2014.

With income outpacing spending, savings surged to $753.3 billion in December, the highest level since December 2012, from $717.8 billion in November.

Higher savings and rising house prices should help to soften the blow from a recent stock market sell-off and drive spending in early 2016.

With consumption soft, inflation retreated in December.

A price index for consumer spending slipped 0.1 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, however, rose 0.6 percent after increasing 0.4 percent in November.

That was the largest increase since December 2014.

Year-over-year inflation rates are rising as the weak readings during the year drop out of the calculation. Excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged after rising 0.2 percent in November. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in November.

Core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and remains well below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.

Based on a single toe bone first found in the 1970s, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the University of Colorado Boulder determined that the bird, named Gastornis, lived in the Arctic Circle on Ellesmere Island.

""People thought there was a larger bird up there but the fossils had never been described,"" CU-Boulders Jaelyn Eberle, a co-author of a study on the bird that appeared in Scientific Reports, told FoxNews.com of the bone which was in the collection of the Canadian Museum of Nature.



""There are lots of wonderful discoveries we can make in the field,"" she said. ""But I would say there are a lot of great discoveries that can be made in collections that have been hanging around for a while but, for whatever reason, hadn't been described. We knew there were birds but nothing had been described until this paper.""

Related: Fossil of massive crocodile found on edge of Sahara desert

Eberle and the lead author on the study, Thomas Stidham, then compared the bone to those of similar bird fossils found in other parts of the world. They concluded it may be of the same genus as giant birds found in mid-latitude locations.

""Gastornis has been known from mid-latitudes for a long time, from Wyoming, Colorado, Europe. What we were able to do was compare that fossil from the Arctic to all of these mid-latitude specimens,"" she said. ""I think what is interesting is that the toe is virtually identifical to specimens from Wyoming. The difference is they are 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) apart. That is kind of strange.""



Coming upon this bird would have been a terrifying sight and researchers initially believed it was a fearsome carnivore. It would have stood 6-feet-tall and been about the size of an adult male with a head about the size of a horse's head.



Related: Fossils of rats as big as dogs found in Southeast Asia

But more recently, other researchers had found that it been a vegan, using its huge beak to tear at foliage, nuts, seeds and hard fruit. And unlike the harsh conditions of Ellesmere Island today where temperatures can drop to minus 40 degrees in winter, the birds environment about 53 million years ago would have been similar to cypress swamps in the southeast, Eberle said.

""It was still formidable but it was the plants that had to be fearful,"" Eberle said.



Fossil evidence indicates the island, which is adjacent to Greenland, hosted turtles, alligators, primates, tapirs and even large hippo-like and rhino-like mammals.

Related: Fossil of ancient fish with massive jaws discovered in Colorado

And unlike modern day ducks and geese that migrate through the Arctic, Eberle said Gastornis was most likely a year-around resident. It would have had enough to plant material eat, she said, and probably wouldn't have had the energy to migrate elsewhere.

""We would hyphosize that a large bird, just like large mammals up there, could overwinter in the Arctic,"" she said. ""Because this is a land dwelling bird, I think they were permanent residents. Part of it is because - this is the same argument we use for the mammmals up there - it's energetically expensive for an animal that walks on land to travel from Ellesmere Island down the tree line each year.""","[]"

A rare weather event caused the spontaneous snowballs at the Nature Conservancy's Silver Creek Preserve and surrounding fields near the tiny town of Picabo.

Preserve manager Sunny Healey spotted the cylindrical shapes up to 18 inches high on Jan. 30 following an overnight windstorm. They created long lines in the snow as they moved.

""You could see the tracks that they made, and I thought that was really curious,"" Healey said. ""I had to stop a couple times. Then, along Highway 20, there were thousands of them.""

So-called snow rollers are so rare and fleeting that the precise weather conditions needed to form them are not defined, said Jay Breidenbach, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Snow rollers up to 18 inches are especially rare.

""Those are some pretty big rollers,"" Breidenbach said. ""I've seen some small rollers, but never that big.""

In general, it takes an unusual combination of a couple of inches of snow with the right water density and temperatures near freezing, followed by strong winds, he said.

""It can't be real dry snow or it would blow into drifts,"" Breidenbach said.

Rollers require some type of firmer base, such as a frozen layer of earlier snow, for the new powder to start rolling on. Plus, the wind must be strong and steady but not with powerful gusts that could damage the formations.

""It would probably blow them apart because they are fragile,"" Breidenbach said.

It snowed on Jan. 29, with the snow becoming wetter toward evening, Healey said. She lives at the preserve and said winds woke her up.

In her five years working at the preserve, she had never seen such an event, but a local rancher in his 70s told her he's spotted them twice in previous decades.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that among the 140,000 new cases of colorectal cancers diagnosed annually, about 3 to 5 percent are caused by Lynch syndrome.

Isabella, who was diagnosed when she was 7, died Saturday, Feb. 6, at age 10, after suffering from a brain tumor linked with the syndrome. Cody, Isabellas 17-year-old brother, died in 2010, and her sister Averi died three years later at age 17. They were both diagnosed with Lynch syndrome too.

Erin Mading, Isabellas mother, told the newspaper that Isabella just flourished during the last year of her life, and she described her as the social butterfly of our street.

NaplesNews.com reported that the Madings relocated from Bonita Springs, Fla. to Pittsburgh so Isabella could undergo an experimental infusion therapy that was part of Bristol-Meyers Squibbs compassionate drug program.

As a result, the expanding ocean that was identified through images from NASAs New Horizons mission may have pushed out the moons surface  causing it to stretch and fracture on a massive scale, NASA said.

The side of Charon viewed by the passing New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015 is characterized by a system of pull apart tectonic faults, which are expressed as ridges, scarps and valleysthe latter sometimes reaching more than 4 miles deep. Charons tectonic landscape shows the landscape expanded in the past and the frozen ocean is the most likely cause.

Scientists have long known that Charons outer layer was primarily water ice. But when the moon was young, this layer was warmed by the decay of radioactive elements, as well as Charons own internal heat of formation  warm enough to cause the ice to melt and form a subsurface ocean.

As Charon cooled over time, this ocean would have frozen and expanded.

But along with choosing a provider and creating your birth plan, taking a tour of the hospital is one of the most important things you can do to ensure you and your baby will be healthy and safe.

Knowing the right questions to ask and what to look for can ensure that the hospital you choose is the best fit for you and your baby. Here are 10 to start with.

1. What level NICU do you have?

Each hospitals neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has designated levels of care, which are set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, its important that you deliver at a level III (subspecialty) NICU.

If you already know that your baby will require special services or will need surgery a few days after being born, for example, its a given that youll be at a hospital that has the appropriate medical team and services in place.

Even if your pregnancy is healthy however, you should make sure that if the hospital you plan to deliver in is a level I or level II NICU, they can still transfer your baby to a higher level NICU if necessary.

2. What amenities are available?

Its important to know what the hospital provides to help you manage labor. For example, youll want to know if they provide squatting bars and birthing balls or if youll need to bring your own.

You might also want to ask if you can bring in your own music or aromatherapy. Some hospitals also offer bathtubs for pain relief while others may only allow you to stand in the shower.

If youre planning to have a water birth, ask if birthing tubs are available, if you can arrange for one to be brought in or if you will need to give birth in a birthing center instead.

3. What type of fetal monitoring is available?

Once youre admitted into the hospital, your baby will be monitored for about 20 to 30 minutes. As long as youre OK, your baby doesnt show signs of distress, and you havent received any medication, you can walk around and have intermittent fetal monitoring until you deliver, said Michele Mayer, a certified nurse midwife at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. Your hospital may also offer portable fetal monitors, so be sure to ask.

4. Do you have doulas?

Studies show women who have doulas during pregnancy, labor and delivery are less likely to have interventions and cesarean sections. Plus, moms are more satisfied with their birthing experiences. Some hospitals offer doulas on staff while at others, you will need to hire an independent doula.

Although some hospitals will provide doulas if you decide to have one after youre admitted into the hospital, its a good idea to choose a doula beforehand so you can make sure you feel supported by her.

Its a relationship thats established during pregnancy, its not a last-minute decision, said Dr. Sherry Ross, an OB-GYN and womens health expert at Providence Saint Johns Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.

5. Can I eat?

If youre admitted into the hospital during early labor, your provider may allow you to eat something small. In fact, research presented at the American Society for Anesthesiologists last fall suggests that eating a light meal during labor is a good idea.

Once youre in active labor however, chances are you may not feel much like eating and you may even be nauseated.

Once youve received medication or an epidural you wont be allowed to eat, since theres a small chance you could aspirate food or liquid into your lungs if you have a cesarean section and need to be intubated, Ross said.

6. What are my pain relief options?

Its important to ask the hospital what your pain relief options are, including an epidural, analgesic medications, nitrous oxide, hydrotherapy or acupuncture, if there are any restrictions and if they will always be accessible.

7. Who can attend the birth?

If you wish to have more than one person in the delivery room, be sure to ask the hospital how many people are allowed to attend. Depending on the size of the room and the unique circumstances of your delivery, it may end up being a collaborative decision made between you, your partner and the doctors and nurses, Ross said.

8. Can we videotape the birth?

For legal reasons, its unlikely that the hospital will allow you to videotape. But once the baby is born, video, photos and FaceTime are probably OK.

9. Whats your security procedure?

After your baby is born, a security bracelet will be placed on your newborns ankle to protect him, but ask about other security measures the hospital takes as well.

10. Do you offer lactation consultants?

Breast-feeding may be natural, but it isnt always easy. In fact, more than 10 percent of women worry about learning how to breast-feed, according to a survey by Lansinoh.

One of the keys to success is to have support from the very beginning. So its a good idea to ask if youll have access to a lactation consultant on staff or if you should get a referral from an independent lactation consultant to come in.

Although your labor and delivery may not go exactly as you planned, knowledge is always power. Do your homework, keep an open mind and be flexible all things that will also serve you well when you become a mom!

Whatever the case, a sickly sea lion caused quite a stir at a San Diego restaurant this week. It was found by staff sleeping in a booth early Thursday overlooking the ocean. It was soon was roused from its slumber and began poking around the restaurant.

I got to tell you when you see a little pup like this, it touches your heart. Its such a cute little thing, the Marine Rooms executive chef Bernard Guillas told FoxNews.com. It looked good to me. It was alert. Then they gave me the news, very much underweight. Ouch. I guess they need to be nice and chubby.

We found This little guy in the The Marine Room restaurant this morninghe was a little bit early for his high tide breakfast reservationas it is this weekend on Sunday and Monday Posted by Bernard Guillas on Thursday, February 4, 2016

Guillas, who joked on his Facebook page that the sea lion had turned up early for a reservation, said it was the first time anything like this had happened. A few times we have had big boys like the big sea lion standing in front of the door, he said. But they never made it inside.

The restaurant staff called the Sea World San Diego rescue team, which took the 8-month-old pup to its rescue center. Weighing only 20 pounds and about the size of a small dog, it is considered a micro pup because it is about half the weight it should be for its age.

Despite its sickly state, Sea World officials told FoxNews.com that they were cautiously optimistic that they could nurse it back to health and eventually return it to the wild. It is currently in Sea Worlds rehabilitation center, where veterinarians and animal care specialist are stabilizing the pup and hydrating it.

Sea World officials believe the sea lion found into its way into the restaurant a warm, dry place to rest.

The pup is only the latest young sea lion to turn up in a strange place along the California coast. With high tides as well as warming waters from El Nino limiting the sea lions food supply, they have been increasingly washing up on shore since 2013 - turning up on beaches and found wandering on California city streets.

In San Diego alone, Sea World has rescued 40 sea lions already this year and 990 in all of 2015  a record number of rescues in a year.","[]"

Well, its true if you care only about style, or if you run a car rental agency. At least thats how its been for the past 50 years, but not anymore.

The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro may still look like the Transformer that vanquished the Ford Mustang on the sales charts after the nameplate returned from hibernation in 2010, but its an all-new and far superior machine.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Chevrolet)

The Camaro it replaces was based on a big, heavy, full-size sedan (then known as the Pontiac G8, now the Chevy SS) and often felt more like Optimus Prime than Bumblebee. Its increasingly potent V8 engines did a good job of hiding this, but it was compromised  and the V6 was overmatched and out of its league.

Still, that didnt stop people from buying. It was the best-selling Camaro by far, but the only excitement it delivered was visual. The new sixth-generation Camaro has plenty of that, but now it shares a platform with Cadillacs acclaimed ATS compact coupe. Its stiffer, smaller in every dimension and a couple of hundred pounds lighter  and those are all wonderful things.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Chevrolet)

Its so trim that Chevy saw fit to make the base engine a 275 hp 4-cylinder turbo, a Camaro first. But while theres a tempting 455 hp V8 at the top of the lineup, its the V6 thats suddenly the most compelling option.

The V8-powered Camaro SS starts at an ambitious $37,295, a $2,795 jump from last year and $4,000 more than a Mustang GT. The V6 model has a base price of $28,190 and comes with a 335 hp 3.6-liter engine thats more than up to the task, thanks to the Camaros trip through the Weight Watchers drive-through.

An 8-speed automatic transmission will likely be chosen by nine out of 10 buyers, but the standard six-speed manual is perfection with a clutch. Each shift is as crisp and direct as loading a Remington 700, and the pedals are positioned close together for easy throttle blips under braking, which required the feet of Shaquille ONeal to do in the last Camaro. Even Mazda Miata owners might be impressed.

Its a true drivers car now, with synapse-quick responses and a neutral stance through curves that can easily be turned into a drift with an authoritative application of power. It also sounds the part, with a revvy, raspy voice that you can enhance with an available $895 dual mode sport exhaust that includes a hushed Stealth setting that will keep the neighbors happy.

It does the cruising thing better than ever, too. Those Cadillac bones bring a level of refinement that contradicts the Camaros juvenile image, even rolling on the big 20-inch wheels and low profile tires that came with my test cars $1,950 RS package.

Related Image Expand / Contract 2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS interior shown (Chevrolet)

The cabin has a modern, well-dressed style thats an evolution of the fifth-generation Camaros, but this time with not one miss on the fit and finish front. Entertainment is handled by an Apple CarPlay-equipped touchscreen system, while an epic row of buttons below it takes care of the climate controls.

The one thing Chevys designers didnt improve, however, is the Camaros outward visibility. Those short, photogenic windows are confining when you get in, like putting on a medieval helmet for the first time. You get used to it, but the optional blind spot monitor and collision warning system are worthwhile options. Thats the price you pay for driving around inside a Hollywood action hero, I guess.

Based purely on performance, this Camaro easily outclasses both the V6 and Turbo 4-cylinder Ford Mustangs, and thats coming from a lifelong Mustang guy. And while Im not sure how many people would actually cross-shop it against the likes of the BMW 2-Series, if you can handle being an extrovert, you should.

Dont get me wrong, Im very much looking forward to trying out the V8, and I will soon. But for anyone who doesnt do the drag racing or track day thing, at $4,552.50 each, the money for those two extra cylinders would probably be better used burning a hole in your pocket than rubber.

Besides, the V6 does that just fine.

Experts from Binghamton University studied hundreds of ancient items found on the shores of Easter Island, which is also known as Rapa Nui. Previously, the artifacts were thought to be spear points, but analysis reveals that they were likely general purpose tools.

Carved from obsidian, or volcanic glass, thousands of the triangular objects, known as mata'a, litter the surface of the island.

We found that when you look at the shape of these things, they just don't look like weapons at all,"" explained Carl Lipo, professor of anthropology at Binghamton University and study lead, in a press release. ""When you can compare them to European weapons or weapons found anywhere around the world when there are actually objects used for warfare, they're very systematic in their shape. They have to do their job really well. Not doing well is risking death.""

Related Image Expand / Contract (Images of various mata'a (Carl Lipo, Binghamton University).)

Lipo and his team analyzed ""the shape variability"" of a photo set of over 400 mata'a.

""You can always use something as a spear. Anything that you have can be a weapon, said Lipo. But under the conditions of warfare, weapons are going to have performance characteristics. And they're going to be very carefully fashioned for that purpose because it matters...You would cut somebody [with a mata'a], but they certainly wouldn't be lethal in any way.""

Some scientists have estimated, that, at its height, Easter Islands population may have been as high as 20,000, but fell over centuries after the islands trees and palms were cut down to build canoes and transport its famous giant statues. One theory suggests that the deforestation led to soil erosion, impacting the islands ability to support wildlife and farming, and the collapse of its civilization.

When the Dutch arrived at the island in 1722, its population was 3,000 or less. Only 111 inhabitants were living on Easter Island by 1877.

Other experts, however, have questioned whether Easter Island ever supported a large population, citing instead the arrival of Europeans, who brought diseases and took islanders away as slaves.

""What people traditionally think about the island is being this island of catastrophe and collapse just isn't true in a pre-historic sense, said Lipo. Populations were successful and lived sustainably on the island up until European contact.

Just look at the data: this year, 27 million Latino and 3.9 million Asian-American voters will be eligible to cast a vote. Combined with African Americans, minorities arent so minor anymore. They are poised to make up 31 percent of voters on Election Day, a decisive role that we will first glimpse in Nevada.

[The 2016 election] will likely be the countrys first glimpse in this cycle into a crystal ball that will show Americans what the not-too-distant future will look like  and how theyll vote. Non-white voters are crucial to choosing not just this President but every future President at increasing rates. - B. Monterosso & S. Bhojwani

In the next two weeks, first and second-generation American voters, including hundreds of thousands of Latinos and Asian-Americans, will have an opportunity to play a key, some would say decisive, role in Nevadas Presidential caucuses for both parties. They will demonstrate their collective power to turn out and unhesitatingly hold candidates responsible for their words and actions on the campaign trail  while also using their voting bloc to help candidates who advocate for all communities win.

The Silver State is remarkable because it will be the first truly representative glimpse into how Americans will react to the 2016 candidates, with the newest demographic reality in place. The states African-American, Asian-American and Latino populations are on the rise, and currently number 9.1 percent, 8.3 percent, and 27.8 percent, respectively.

In addition, nearly 20 percent of Nevadas residents are foreign-born. It will likely be the countrys first glimpse in this cycle into a crystal ball that will show Americans what the not-too-distant future will look like  and how theyll vote. Non-white voters are crucial to choosing not just this President but every future President at increasing rates.

United in our concerns, the new American majority will continue to demand that our countrys leaders reflect the nations shifting culture and genuinely connect with communities of color on our issues. For Latinos and Asians, job creation with living wages ranks as a top issue. Both communities also care about immigration, healthcare, education, workers rights, and climate change. Together, these communities, the fastest growing immigrant groups in the country, help to form the new American majority. The might of our electoral power will match any increasing extremism with the power of our ballots.

Yet, many presidential candidates seem not to have gotten the memo. Several, including some front-runners, continue to support anti-immigrant legislation and employ messaging that diminishes, demonizes and degrades immigrants and all new American communities. This is not just bad for the country but bad for the future of their own political parties. Furthermore,candidates using this rhetoric should tune in to the fact that it will not suppress the minority vote.

In fact, especially among Latinos, anti-immigrant rhetoric may lead to higher turnout. For example, in Arizona, Latino voters are believed to be responsible for the recall of State Senator Russell Pearce in 2012, in response to his anti-immigrant stance and support of SB 1070, commonly known as the Show me Your Papers law.

In the 2016 election cycle, despite some superficial talk of voter diversity, were missing the real point and the powerful potency of the new American majority  how voters are united around core issues and a desire for recognition and validation.

New American voters including Latinos, Asian Americans, and other immigrant groups will be critical to ensuring that our government works to meet the needs of all of its citizens not just the few in power. In short, rhetoric and legislation thats intended to dampen participation and keep diverse, minority communities in the shadows will actually backfire.

Candidates who underestimate our communities determination to be included and heard do so at their own peril.

China started work on FASTthe Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescopeback in 2011, Xinhua reports. It's scheduled to be completed this September. But first 9,110 residents living within three miles of the project need to be relocated in order toin the words of one Chinese official""create a sound electromagnetic wave environment."" According to the Guardian, such relocations are a ""Communist Party specialty,"" with millions having been moved in recent decades to make room for infrastructure projects.

Relocated residents will receive a little more than $1,800 each for their trouble. Once complete, FAST will be the largest radio telescope in the world200 meters greater in diameter than the current biggest in Puerto Rico.

One scientist on the project explained its size in terms of wine, for some reason, stating that if FAST were filled with wine, all 7 billion people on Earth could each fill five bottles from it.

The Chinese government hopes to use the telescope to look for signs of extraterrestrial life and study the origins of the universe. Its size will make a difficult job slightly easier.

""A radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe,"" the Guardian quotes a FAST scientist as saying.

""It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm. Time reports FAST will cost $180 million. (Maybe we can't find aliens because they don't evolve quickly enough.)

And they weren't a pleasant 30 hours, either. ""I've never seen an airsick bag used before and many were,"" one unfortunate passenger says. Flight 944 left Punta Cana on Monday afternoon but had to divert to New Hampshire after heavy runway traffic and low fuel prevented it from landing at JFK International, per NBC New York.

Things didn't get any better in New Hampshire, where the plane had to stay overnight because of rules on how many hours a crew can fly.

What's more, passengers had to wait two hours for customs officials to arrive from Maine before they could get off the plane, Gothamist reports. And even then they were only allowed off 20 people at a time.

The plane and its intrepid passengers once again made for JFK on Tuesday only to encounter 60mph winds. It was so bad that many passengers were either puking or getting oxygen.

One passenger tells NBC she ""thought the plane was going to break in half."" The plane was diverted again, this time to Boston, where passengers weren't initially allowed off.

""People were banging on the door,"" one passenger tells the Tribune. ""The captain was advocating to let us go."" They eventually got their wish, with many passengers giving up on the flight altogether and booking train tickets.

The Obama administration told a magistrate judge Friday it would be willing to allow Apple to retain possession of and later destroy specialized software it was ordered to create to help federal authorities hack into the encrypted iPhone belong to Syed Rizwan Farook.

""Apple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders,"" the Justice Department told Judge Sheri Pym. ""No one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.""

On Tuesday, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the FBI hack into the phone used by Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December.

Although the judge instructed Apple to create the software for the FBI, she said it could be loaded onto the phone at an Apple facility. The Justice Department made explicit Friday that Apple could retain custody of the software at all times.

That's a good ""compromise position"" because ""they're giving all the power to Apple,"" Jason Healey, a former director on cyber policy at the White House, told the Associated Press.

""They're telling Apple, 'You hold the software, we're not asking you to put a backdoor in the encryption, we just want to be able to brute force this thing,'"" Healey said. ""If the precedent is this, that they deliver the phone to Apple and Apple does it, I think that's a pretty good precedent that can't be done en masse on the next thousand iPhones.""

Authorities want Apple to bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to guess the passcode. Apple has helped the government before in this and previous cases, but this time Apple CEO Tim Cook said no and Apple is appealing the order.

The Justice Department filed a motion earlier Friday to compel Apple to comply with the court order.

""Apple has attempted to design and market its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data which has been found by this Court to be warranted for an important investigation. Despite its efforts, Apple nonetheless retains the technical ability to comply with the order, and so should be required to obey it,"" the motion states.

While the judge on the case says the government is only asking for help unlocking one, single iPhone, Apple says the case is much bigger than that and sets a dangerous precedent. Cook says the company doesn't have a system to bypass the self-destruct one.

""Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks  from restaurants and banks to stores and homes,"" Cook said.

The company has an additional three days to file its opposition to Tuesday's court order which is now due on Feb. 26, a law enforcement official tells Fox News.

The Dachshunds, named Jose and Foxy, each has its own problem. Foxy seems to detest Seinfeld, and Jose wont stop barking.

Millan, who describes Cesar 911 as a show in which he deals with extreme behavior that have owners rethinking keeping their pets, comes to the rescue by paying a visit to the home of Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld.

The biggest challenge in the Seinfeld-Dachshund case?

Jerry being Jerry is very fun to be around, the whole entire time youre laughing, Millan said in an interview with Fox News Latino. That was my challenge  to not laugh because I wanted to be serious.

It was hard, but it was fun.

Other extreme behavior cases that Millan will be dealing in the new season involve dogs who fatally attack other animals. Millan said that is becoming more common as people bring non-traditional animals such as pigs and goats into their home as pets.

The cases this season are way more extreme than ever, Millan said, adding that he enjoys working with pets that seem incorrigible to others. One dog killed two pigs. Another dog killed four goats.

I dont like to say Lets give up on a dog, Millan said. I think Lets give up on being lazy, lets give up on thinking negative.

Millan came from Mexico as a young man with dreams of bringing his dog training gifts to his adopted homeland. He eventually built an empire around his love of dogs. It includes not just TV shows that became hits, but also books, pet products, magazines and a website.

The famous dog expert is not the only Millan debuting a new season.

His son, Andre, who many saw as a young boy on the Dog Whisperer, going along with his father to address dogs worrisome behavior, is launching the first primetime talk show for pet owners.

Pet Talk, where Andre, who is 21, will be a field reporter, will air on Friday, Feb. 19.

Like Cesar 911, Pet Talk will air on Nat Geo WILD at 10 p.m. Eastern Time, following Cesar Millans show, which airs at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

As the child of a Filipina mother and Jewish father, Cohen, now the executive chef and owner of New York City's Asian-inspired Pig & Khao, had different culinary inspirations than most of her contemporaries.

""At a young age I was eating a lot of adventurous kinds of foods that most normal people were not eating. So that kind of got me into Southeast Asian food, growing up eating it, she said. That influenced my palate as a kid.""

But when Cohen decided to become a chef professionally, she started off on a more traditional route. She went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and then worked in fine dining restaurants, with a focus on Italian cuisine.

She worked at the acclaimed Eleven Madison Park under Chef Daniel Humm and then later with Anne Burrell at Centro Vinoteca--both in New York City.

A stint on the show Top Chef brought her recognition and confidence as a chef (she placed 6th on Season 5 of the show). But she said that it took a year living in Southeast Asia to make her realize her true calling which wasnt the classic standards. ""I just got really bored with it,"" Cohen explains. ""I used to love cooking Italian food but I never got that same connection that I do to the food of Southeast Asia.""

She first needed to perfect her skills, so she moved to Asia for a year. She had guest stints cooking at some of the regions top rated restaurants, such as Hong Kongs BoLan. She spent a lot of time in Thailand and had an apartment in Bangkok, allowing her to absorb the local flavors and cooking techniques. And she had her Filipino family and friends show her their special dishes.

These experiences prepared her for her return to New York City to open the Pig and Khao (""khao"" means rice in Thai) to rave reviews. New York Times food critic Pete Wells gave her place a two-star review and Mario Batali recently named her a one of three raising star chefs to watch.

The restaurant aims not to be overly traditional and instead is the kind of casual place Cohen would want to eat at. ""The vibe of the Lower East Side suited me,"" she shares about the restaurant's hip Manhattan neighborhood. ""It allowed me to do the type of restaurant I wanted to do - for it to be not stuffy and to be a lot of fun.""

With a colorful decor and a menu full of shareable items, the restaurant delivers with a surprising variety that's now become Cohen's signature style.","[]"

The confrontation has pitted privacy advocates, who do not want to give any ground to government efforts to undermine encryption, and law enforcement officials who say people's lives may be at stake unless the shooter's iPhone is unlocked.

""Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ... Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order,"" prosecutors wrote in the Friday order.

""Apple's current refusal to comply with the court's order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy,"" prosecutors added.

"125","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Drinking more coffee may undo liver damage from booze","[]","Drinking more coffee might help reduce the kind of liver damage that's associated with overindulging in food and alcohol, a review of existing studies suggests.

Researchers analyzed data from nine previously published studies with a total of more than 430,000 participants and found that drinking two additional cups of coffee a day was linked to a 44 percent lower risk of developing liver cirrhosis.

""Cirrhosis is potentially fatal and there is no cure as such,"" said lead study author Dr. Oliver Kennedy of Southampton University in the U.K.

""Therefore, it is significant that the risk of developing cirrhosis may be reduced by consumption of coffee, a cheap, ubiquitous and well-tolerated beverage,"" Kennedy added by email.

Cirrhosis kills more than one million people every year worldwide. It can be caused by hepatitis infections, excessive alcohol consumption, immune disorders, and fatty liver disease, which is tied to obesity and diabetes.

Kennedy and colleagues did a pooled analysis of average coffee consumption across earlier studies to see how much adding two additional cups each day might influence the odds of liver disease.

Combined, the studies included 1,990 patients with cirrhosis.

In eight of the nine studies analyzed, increasing coffee consumption by two cups a day was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cirrhosis.

In all but one study, the risk of cirrhosis continued to decline as daily cups of coffee climbed.

Compared to no coffee consumption, researchers estimated one cup a day was tied to a 22 percent lower risk of cirrhosis. With two cups, the risk dropped by 43 percent, while it declined 57 percent for three cups and 65 percent with four cups.

But the results still leave some unresolved questions.

One study, for example, found a stronger link between coffee consumption and reduced cirrhosis risk with filtered coffee than with boiled coffee.

And, while the studies accounted for alcohol consumption, not all them accounted for other cirrhosis risk factors like obesity and diabetes, the authors note in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, online January 25.

Patients also shouldn't take the findings to mean loading up on frothy caramel lattes packed with sugar and topped with whipped cream is a good way to prevent liver disease, Kennedy cautioned. It's also not clear exactly how coffee might lead to a healthier liver, or whether the type of beans or brewing method matter.

""Coffee is a complex mixture containing hundreds of chemical compounds, and it is unknown which of these is responsible for protecting the liver,"" Kennedy said.

It's also important to note that coffee isn't powerful enough to counteract lifestyle choices that can severely damage the liver, said Samantha Heller, a senior clinical nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York who wasn't involved in the study.

""Unfortunately, although coffee contains compounds that have antioxidant effects and anti-inflammatory properties, drinking a few cups of coffee a day cannot undo the systematic damage that is the result of being overweight or obese, sedentary, excessive alcohol consumption or drastically mitigate an unhealthy diet,"" Heller said by email.","[]"

As a result, missing the postseason for the second time in three years is looking more likely than making up the necessary ground for a Western Conference wild card.

The Canucks have won only twice in their last 10 games overall and have lost six straight at home heading into Sunday night's matchup with the Colorado Avalanche, who are fighting to hold their playoff position.

Vancouver (22-24-12) has allowed 34 goals during a 2-7-1 stretch while slipping to 11th in the West, nine points back of Nashville for the final playoff spot. Each contest during its four-game losing streak has been decided by a 5-2 score, with Ryan Miller and Jacob Markstrom each starting twice.

Markstrom lost Friday at Calgary and has a .851 save percentage in his last two after winning his previous four starts with a 1.71 goals-against average. He made 29 saves during the last start in that span to beat Colorado 3-1 on Feb. 9.

Coach Willie Desjardins had yet to announce if he'll go with Markstrom or Miller, who is 1-5-2 with a 2.49 GAA since Jan. 19.

""You can't let the negativity take over. You've got to stick together as a team,"" Markstrom said. ""We're in the same boat. Nobody wants to be in this boat, but the reality is we're all in it. We've got to find a way to get out of it.

""We've got to show up in practice and just work hard. That's what it takes. Wins are not going to come easy in this league.""

That's been especially true at home recently. The Canucks are 0-5-1 at Rogers Arena during their slump and haven't dropped seven in a row there since an 0-6-3 skid in 2008-09.

Vancouver has scored fewer than three goals in each game during its current losing streak and hasn't won a home game since beating Florida on Jan. 11. This is the first of a five-game homestand.

""It's going to be huge for us to turn this around,"" said rookie Jake Virtanen, who scored against the Flames. ""We're obviously going to have to step up as a team and the younger guys are going to have to step up and the older guys are going to have to keep on playing hard.""

The Sedins have done their part. Daniel has a goal and four assist during a four-game point streak and Henrik posted the same totals during his own four-game run that ended Friday.

Bo Horvat had a goal and an assist in the first meeting with the Avalanche (31-26-4), who have won the last two matchups in Vancouver after dropping the previous nine.

Colorado holds the West's first wild-card spot and has won four of five after beating Edmonton 3-2 on Saturday. Tyson Barrie scored the go-ahead goal 1:23 into the second period and added an insurance goal in the third to back Calvin Pickard's 25-save performance.

The Avalanche have won six of eight on the road since Jan. 18.

""We like our game,"" coach Patrick Roy said. ""Hopefully we can carry it into (Sunday). On the road we seem to play with a lot of confidence.""

Semyon Varlamov will get the start in net. He stopped 32 shots in Wednesday's win over Montreal but has a 3.74 GAA over his last three against the Canucks, including the defeat earlier this month.","[]"

"135","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Medieval shipwreck hauled from the deep","[]","A nearly intact medieval shipwreck has been hauled from the frigid waters of a Dutch river.

The boat was likely deliberately sunk by maritime engineers more than 600 years ago in an effort to alter the flow of the Ijssel River, an offshoot of the mighty Rhine River that flows through six European countries. The trading ship sailed at a time when the Hanseatic League, a group of guilds that fostered trade across Europe, dominated the seas.

""The fact that we were able to raise the Ijssel cog [a type of wooden vessel] in its entirety and in one attempt is a fantastic achievement by the entire team,"" lead maritime archaeologist Wouter Waldus said in a statement. ""The shipwreck can become a symbol of our rich maritime history, and I fully expect many people, both young and old, to be amazed by and start enjoying this ship from the Hanseatic period's fascinating story."" [See Images of the Medieval Trading Ship and Reconstruction]

Surprise discovery

The boat was first discovered in 2012 at the river bottom during efforts to widen the flow of the Ijssel River. The massive ship was lying perpendicular to the river flow, along with a medieval barge and a punt, a specialized ship designed for navigating river deltas.

Over the course of the next three years, maritime archaeologists put in place a painstaking, meticulous plan to recover the ancient seafaring vessel. First, the team built a platform and crane on the river, then built a protective frame around the ship to lift it out of the water. After suctioning gunk from the area inside the frame, the archeological team created 3D images of the boat underwater. Only then were the team members ready to carefully lift the boat out of the water, using a basketlike structure made of straps, crossbeams and jacks. Each strap had its own motorized control to allow perfectly precise maneuvering in response to the forces experienced in the ship.

""This was an incredibly involved operation and was almost as impressive as the cog itself. The raising of the 65 feet ship was complex, in the middle of the river, near the navigation channel. Also, as a result of the fact, three different specializations had to work together here: an archaeological research team, divers and storage specialists,"" said Ben Broens, an official with the Rijkswaterstaat, a water management bureau in the Dutch government, which helped oversee the salvage operation.

Medieval cog

It turned out the 55-ton (50 tonnes) ship was a medieval cog, a type of wooden vessel with a steep, straight ship prow and deck beams that stick out from the boat's skin. Cogs were typically used in the late medieval period on international trade voyages. Many of the structural support elements, such as nails, were made of metal, meaning it was sturdier, and therefore easier to take out of the water without falling apart.

The team believes the ancient seafaring vessel was likely sunk deliberately. It was placed perpendicular in the stream of the river. By looking at medieval maps and historical documents and recreating the historical path of the river, the team found the ship was sunk at a time when silt was building up, creating huge sandbanks along the Ijssel River. Those sandbanks would have prevented ships from docking properly, so the ship, along with the barge and punt, were likely sent to the bottom of the river in a bid to narrow the river flow or divert it in a way that would improve sea traffic.

Though the ship was stripped of much of its original finery, the team did find an intact brick oven, as well as gorgeous glazed tiles, in the galley area of the ship.

Now that the ship is safely out of the water, the team will transport it inside its custom-made frame to a preservation facility in Leylstad, the Netherlands. There, it will undergo a painstaking process of drying out, which could take another three years. If all goes well, the Ijssel Cog will be placed on display in a museum. But if the ship can't be dried out safely, it will be studied thoroughly before being destroyed.

Winds from Cyclone Winston, which tore through the Pacific Island chain over the weekend, reached 177 miles per hour, making it the strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere since record-keeping began, according to the Weather Underground website.

Although the weather calmed Sunday, a curfew was extended through early Monday and police were empowered to make arrests without a warrant to ensure order.

In a televised address to the nation Sunday, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said many people had been left without power, fresh water or communications.

""The damage has been widespread, homes have been destroyed, many low-lying areas have flooded, and many people have been left stunned and confused about what to do,"" he said.

He said that the police and military had been brought in to help with rescue operations and the general cleanup, and that government agencies were working overtime to clear roads and restore power.

""This is a time of sorrow, but it will also be a time of action,"" Bainimarama said. ""We will stand united in the face of this disaster.""

Officials were trying to establish communications and road access to the hardest-hit areas, and said they would not know the full extent of the damage and injuries until then.

George Dregaso of Fiji's National Disaster Management Office said that two people on Ovalau Island died when the house they were sheltering in collapsed on them, and that another man was killed on Koro Island, although it wasn't clear how.

Authorities also said three people on the main island of Viti Levu were killed in the storm, but didn't have more details.

Tourism Minister Faiyaz Siddiq Koya said that all tourists in Fiji were safe and that there was no significant damage to the majority of hotels on the main island. Fiji is a popular tourist destination, known for its beach resorts and scuba diving.

Cyclone Winston hit Fiji on Saturday and moved westward overnight along the northern coast of Viti Levu. Fiji's capital, Suva, located in the southern part of the main island, was not directly in the cyclone's path and avoided the worst of its destructive power.

""Truth be told, we've gotten off pretty lightly here in the capital,"" said Alice Clements, a spokeswoman for UNICEF. ""It was still a pretty awful night. You could hear crashing trees and power lines, and popping rivets as roofs got lifted and ripped out.""

She said there was foliage everywhere that looked like it had been put through a blender.

About 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 people were without regular power, although about one-third of them were able to get some electricity from generators, said Dregaso, the disaster office official. Landlines throughout Fiji were down, but most mobile networks were working.

Dregaso said there were 483 people who had evacuated from their homes and were staying in 32 emergency shelters. He said he expected the number of evacuees to rise.

Authorities were urging people to remain indoors as they cleared fallen trees and power lines. They said that all schools would be closed for a week to allow time for the cleanup, and that three universities would be closed until further notice.

The government declared a 30-day state of natural disaster, giving extra powers to police to arrest people without a warrant.

The government said the curfew would end at 5:30 a.m. Monday.

""The curfew has been imposed to protect lives and protect property,"" Prime Minister Bainimarama said in his address.

Clements, the UNICEF spokeswoman, said there was particular concern for people on the northern part of the main island and on smaller islands. She said that many would have lost their homes and livelihoods, and that some tourist resorts on the outer islands may have been damaged.

The airport reopened Sunday to allow emergency flights, Dregaso said, after many flights had been canceled the day before.","[]"

To be sure, Trump has attacked the president so relentlessly on so many issues, from health care to terrorism, that its easy to understand why Obama wanted to get a few licks in. But theres a back story that goes beyond sparring on the trail.

Five years ago, Trump garnered enormous attention for appearing the embrace the birther movement, questioning whether Obama was actually born in Hawaii. Then, as now, much of the media and political establishment came down on Trump for pushing a conspiracy theory, although the billionaire kept saying he was just raising the question. He got under Obamas skin, and finally prodded the president into releasing his long-form birth certificate.

I was at the White House Correspondents Dinner when Obama took delight in mocking Trump, who was glowering in the audience as a guest of the Washington Post.

No one is happierno one is prouderto put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald, Obama said in 2011. And thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter: Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?

So its personal.

Thus it was that Obama told reporters on Tuesday: I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President. And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being President is a serious job. Its not hosting a talk show or a reality show. Its not promotion. Its not marketing. Its hard.

Obama did try to pivot to the other Republicans, saying Trumps rivals agree with him on many issues but just dont put things as colorfully. There was also a not-so-veiled shot at Marco Rubio on immigration. But Trump was the only one he mentioned by name.

Surely Obama recognizes that his opposition only helps Trump with Republicans by elevating him. My guess is that he weighed that factor against the downside of remaining silent.

Its highly unusual for a president to attack the other partys front-runner this early in the cycle. In August 1988, referring to rumors that Michael Dukakis had been treated for depression, President Ronald Reagan jokingly said Im not going to pick on an invalid. But Dukakis had already won the Democratic nomination.

In fact, Trump is now at war with the last two presidentsObama and George W. Bushwhich burnishes his brand of taking on the establishment in both parties.

Bush is a riskier target for a Republican, but so far it doesnt seem to have hurt Trump.

Meanwhile, Obama chose to weigh in on the Democratic contest as well:

I know Hillary better than I know Bernie because she served in my administration and she was an outstanding secretary of State. And I suspect that on certain issues she agrees with me more than Bernie does. On the other hand, there may be a couple issues where Bernie agrees with me more, I don't know.

That was virtually an endorsement, or as close as a president proclaiming to stay neutral can come. And Hillary Clinton, after some earlier distancing, is hugging Obama pretty closely as she finds herself in an unexpectedly tight contest with Bernie Sanders after getting clobbered in New Hampshire. She not only invokes their working relationship but has chided Sanders for his criticism of Obama and for encouraging a primary challenge in 2012.

Clearly, Obama wants his former rival to be the one to potentially take on his former tormentor, Donald Trump.

"148","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Matt Brown: There's a fundamental flaw in Ronda Rousey's psychology","[]","Ronda Rousey has been in the headlines all week after stating in an interview that she contemplated killing herself in the moments just after losing to Holly Holm at UFC 193 last November.

There have been a number of opinions expressed on the matter, but top 10-ranked welterweight Matt Brown said on the latest ""Great MMA Debate"" podcast that for all the flack that Rousey's getting for making what seems to be a shocking revelation isn't actually all that uncommon for fighters.

""She's just one of a million to feel that way. Every athlete that loses feels that exact same thing. She's not special in that regard,"" Brown said on the show.

""A day or two later, I can see her saying I felt suicidal or whatever. That's not an uncommon feeling. I've felt that same way before. I lost three in a row and had newborn babies and didn't know when I was going to get another paycheck, thought I was going to be cut from the UFC. I felt the exact same feelings before.""

The difference where Brown falls off the wagon to support Rousey is the fact that she said these statements nearly four months after losing to Holm.

Brown believes that Rousey still hasn't actually accepted the defeat because nowhere during her interview did her sadness turn to anger or determination with a focus on going back and beating Holm in the rematch.

Obviously, Rousey said that she was going to fight Holm a second time, but he didn't hear her pay any credit to the current champion for the win nor did she sound all that excited about doing it over again.

""It's a fundamental flaw in her psychology,"" Brown explained. ""It's Day One s--t. I don't claim to be the best fighter, but I guarantee I have put in as much time if not the most time of any fighter you've ever met, I guarantee I put in as much if not more time on the mental side of this game, the psychology, the mental training. I'm constantly reading about it. I've probably talked to 20 different sports psychologists in my life.

""You had four months to deal with this. By now the lesson should be learned and you should be moving forward and I didn't hear that.""

Brown also speaks to the example Rousey sets for the sport while appearing on nationally syndicated talk shows like ""The Ellen Show"" where millions of people are watching from around the world who may not be hardcore mixed martial arts fans.

Brown clearly understands the emotions Rousey felt after her loss, but he also says there's a way to express that while still being an example to kids as well as paying homage to your opponent for a job well done.

""Maybe she needed to do that. I could definitely be wrong in this. Maybe she just needed to go out and let it out a little bit,"" Brown said. ""For me, I'd rather her as a representative for our sport, as a role model for young children, as someone that's representing our sport in front of millions of housewives who probably don't know anything about our sport, to go out there and talk nobly and honorably like a warrior. Give Holly her credit, accept what happened and talk about how she's going to move forward and do better. That's not what I got.""

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","[]"

How is it possible to have presidential contests in Nevada and South Carolina that are both appealing and appalling to conservatives?

Lets review Saturdays results.

In Nevadas Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didnt connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity.

Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there.","[]"

The website, which features other digitally altered images of the Florida senator, offers visitors the chance to take a stand against Rubio, with a link to Ted Cruzs get-out-the-vote site.

Officers found the cocaine, which had been hidden in a box, while assisting the three people trapped inside the vehicle.

Officers determined that the man was a provincial official and handed him, his wife and his son over to federal prosecutors.

Lets review Saturdays results.

In Nevadas Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didnt connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity.

Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign cant wait to bid adieu to a February in which the candidate hasnt run so much as shes lurched.

Pre-Nevada, Hillarys national lead over Sanders evaporated. Showing none of the certainty of a repeat presidential candidate, Clinton has fiddled with her core message (Im a progressive who likes to get things done) with the same frequency that she changed hairstyles back in the 1990s.

The bottom line: despite winning Nevada, Clintons long-term prospects remain shaky.

And that should elate conservatives.

Now, for the appalling: a Republican primary in South Carolina that had little do with conservative principles, ideas or values.

The complaint here isnt that Donald Trump won. Or, that his dominance again defies common sense: only a single-digit number of South Carolinians told exit pollsters that Trump shares their values; the twice-divorced candidate split the evangelical vote with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

The concern: the nature of how Trump goes about his business  the king of noisy bandwidth, his bombast and calculated fights for months now have dominated news cycles, streamed ceaselessly on social media, and stifled any chance at a calm, rational, issues-driven conversation on the Republican slide.

South Carolina was yet another casualty. The primary was an opportunity to discuss what exactly the conservative movement embodies these days. Now, the moments passed.

To the need to broadening the partys appeal to win national elections, there was a chance to showcase Gov. Nikki Haley (the nations only female Indian-American head of state) and Sen. Tim Scott (one of only two African-American senators).

Both supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dominated the exit-poll electability question. Both played cameos roles compared to the candidates infighting.

South Carolina leads the nation in direct foreign investment and has a veteran population 25 percent larger than the national average. Last year, the state dealt gracefully with three divisive issues: lowering the Confederate flag at the state Capitol; a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston that led to an outpouring of calm, not violence; the fatal police shooting of black man in North Charleston that likewise didnt turn into urban riots.

So where was the conversation regarding growing the economy, the perils of union over-reach (West Virginia, like South Carolina, becoming a right-to-work state this past week), a more coherent foreign policy and a more united society across racial and ideological lines?

The answer: they all were smothered by Trumps antics  and a malady best described as Candidate Derangement Syndrome.

During the course of the GOPs 10-day road trip down south, Trump threatened to sue Cruz over an ad claiming the GOP frontrunner once supported abortion rights. Trump went mano-a-mitre with Pope Francis over building a border wall. He blamed George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks, insinuating that the former president lied his way into the Iraq invasion. Trump even called for a boycott of Apple products so long as the computer refuses to hack into a dead terrorists iPhone.

The media ate it up.

Not surprisingly, the primary played into the stereotype of South Carolina as a political circus.

In fairness, Trumps not the only offender here. Cruz and Rubio spit-balled each other over character flaws, policy inconsistencies and sloppy photo-shopping. Jeb Bush went after Trump in defense of his big brother and in vain hopes of jump-starting a campaign that ended not long after the polls closed.

The question moving forward for conservatives: is this the way its going to be until someone earns 1,237 delegates and the partys nomination?

With three primaries down and another 17 Republican contests to be held over the course of the next two weeks, look for the following dominos to tumble.

Bush. Theres a saying in Silicon Valley: WFIO. It stands for Were F---ed, Its Over.

Credit Jeb Bush with recognizing in an instant that his campaign was over. His concession speech was dignified and without a trace of bitterness  rarities in this age of harsh politics. Other candidates whod spend nearly $81 million in ads ($15 million in South Carolina) with only four delegates to show night not have been so graceful.

Now, the political question: how quickly does Bush throw his organizational and financial weight behind Rubio? Its a good question, as relations between the Floridians are strained, but nowhere near Bushs animosity for Trump.

Rubio. As was the case after his third-place finish in Iowa, opportunity knocks. So how does Rubio capitalize on newfound moment? Look for an infusion of cash and a spate of endorsements. Rubios priorities in the weeks ahead: amassing delegates on March 1 (much easier now that Bush is out of the race), winning Florida on March 15.

Meanwhile, circle this date: Feb. 25. Its the next GOP candidates debate  University of Houston, CNN and Telemundo moderating. And its Rubios next chance to shine as the establishments alternative to Trump and Cruz.

Cruz. Six March 1 states line up as targets for Cruz  Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and his home state of Texas. For Cruz, the goal is to stay close to Trump by winning as many delegates as possible in these winner-takes-most states that allot the delegates proportionally.

The key figure for Cruz and Rubio, presuming Trump continues to run in the low- to mid-30s: 20 percent, which is the threshold required in most states in order to earn delegates.

Trump. Yes, he won. Decisively so.

But as the attention focuses on three candidates, does Trumps share of the pie expand? Trumps support so far: 24.3 percent in Iowa; 35.3 percent in New Hampshire; 33 percent in South Carolina.

For those who see Trump as a media-savvier version of Pat Buchanans insurrection back in 1992, this reminder: Buchanan peaked at 37.5 percent in New Hampshire; he then had trouble cracking 30 percent. The protest movement had a ceiling.

Unlike Buchanans run, Trump is actually winning states. Whether he can get to 40 percent and beyond: its the difference between a race that could be over by Easter Sunday or an unsettled national convention in July.

With the Republican race staying in the South through March 1, perhaps its best to remember a NASCAR adage about the pushing and shoving and fender-bending that occurs along the speedway: rubbings racing.

Thats true in this Republican field, even if the process rubs conservatives the wrong way.

To tame your appetite for nonstop streaming and Netflix binges, a number of companies are imposing or testing broadband data capsalso called ""usage-based pricing""that limit the amount of streaming you can do without having to pay extra. Comcast is the largest company applying these caps, and it recently expanded its tests to 10 states, and several large cities, including Atlanta, Miami, and Nashville. On its website, the company says that if you use more than the 300GB allotted each month and want to continue streaming, you'll have to buy additional 50GB blocks at $10 each. The company also has an ""unlimited"" data option in some markets that costs an extra $30 to $35 each month.

There's one major exception to those caps: Comcast isn't counting programming from its own Stream TV when calculating how much data you use. We think you'll hear more about this practice, called zero rating, over the next few months. It's fairly common among cell phone carriers: T-Mobile's Binge On and Verizon's Go90 mobile video services are both exempt from those carriers data caps.

At first, zero rating might seem like a good deal for consumersafter all, you get to watch movies without having to pay for the extra data you use. However, groups including Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, arent so sure, as it provides an incentive for you to choose a broadband provider's own service rather than a competitor's, which seems unfair. Zero rating isn't banned by the FCC's Open Internet rules, but it seems to dance close to the line. While the practice isn't explicitly prohibited, the FCC has said it will evaluate such business practices on a case-by-case basis.

Other companies testing or broadly imposing data caps include AT&T, CenturyLink, Cox, and Suddenlink; surcharges kick in after you've used 150GB per month (for those with slower DSL connections) to 250GB or 300GB (faster connections).

Will You Hit Your Cap?

Comcast argues that fewer than 10 percent of its customers will ever reach a broadband cap under normal usage. The company also has a three-month courtesy plan, so that you only get charged extra for any overages when you exceed your cap for the fourth month.

But here's why Comcast data caps could be a concern for many families. Netflix says that streaming a high-def movie can eat up close to 5GB per hour, so you'd have to burn through 50 hours of movies25 two-hour moviesor 50 one-hour TV shows, to hit a 250GB monthly cap. Admittedly, few of us watch that much streamingby ourselves. But those numbers start to look far more modest when you consider a household with a few children and multiple devicessmart TVs, streaming players, game consoles, Blu-ray players, tablets, smartphonesall connected to the Internet via the home's Wi-Fi network. In households where several members like to watch several episodes, or even whole seasons, of a show in binges, data usage grow quickly.

And in the near future, it's likely we'll all be using more, not less data, as more of our entertainment migrates to the Web, and the Internet of Things adds connectivity to all sorts of deviceseverything from thermostats to smart refrigerators.

We expect to see streaming services add more higher-bandwidth 4K videoswith four times as many pixels as HD streamsto their mix, some with high dynamic range and wider color gamuts. Even with more efficient video encoding, these enhancements to video picture quality will eat up more data than regular HD streams. And analysts at market-research firms expect more ISPs to try usage-based pricing to compensate for the loss of subscribers to traditional TV services who switch to Internet-based alternatives.

Not surprisingly, data caps have become a hot-button issue with consumers who now have to live with them. A Freedom of Information Act request, filed by the CutCableToday website, revealed that the FCC received 13,000 formal complaints from Comcast customers protesting the practice. Time Warner Cable experimented with usage-based pricing as an option, but abandoned the practice after it was poorly received.

Charter, currently looking for regulatory approval to merge with Time Warner Cable, has pledged to refrain from usage-based fees, at least for the next three years. Neither Verizon nor Bright House, which is also being acquired by Charter, has data caps, and both have said they won't impose them in the near future.

Consumer Reports and Consumers Union have pointed out how broadband data caps could discourage the use of the Internet for a variety of worthwhile activities, including education and small-business innovation.

If you have a broadband plan that is subject to a data cap, let us know in the comments below; tell us whether you regularly exceed your monthly data allotment.

The upheaved rock and soil was discovered after a deep boom thundered through the forest near Birch Creek on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, north of Menominee. The sound shook nearby homes with the strength of a magnitude-1 earthquake on Oct. 4, 2010, at about 8:30 a.m. Central time, residents said at the time. The next day, locals discovered a long crack atop a narrow ridge.

The crack was 360 feet long and about 5 feet deep; and the ridge was nearly 7 feet high and about 30 feet wide at its largest point. Tilted trees leaned away from the crack at about 14 degrees on either side  proof the ridge was new. Torn roots stretched for their former companions, now stranded on the other side of the crack. [See Photos of the Weird Crack and Uprooted Trees]

""It was interesting to see that the crack seemed to ignore the roots,"" said senior study author Wayne Pennington, dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan Technology University in Houghton. ""The forces were stronger than the roots.""

Based on a seismic study, the most likely explanation for the ridge is a pop-up in the upper layers of limestone beneath the clay soil, Pennington and his co-authors, all MTU students, concluded in a study published in the journal Seismological Research Letters.

If I had a hammer

Even though the researchers can't say for sure what caused the pop-up, they now have a better picture of what happened underground.

The teams surveyed the underground rock by creating sound waves with a sledgehammer. The researchers slammed a sledgehammer into a metal ball sitting on the ground, and tracked how the waves passed through the soil and rock layers below. The analysis revealed a sharp buckle in the limestone below the crack.

That picture suggested the bedrock limestone violently heaved upward when the pop-up appeared, displacing the overlying clay layer. The clay soil is about 5 feet deep along the ridge. The crack resulted from the stretching of the surface clay as it bent upward, much as a crack forms in the top of a loaf of bread as the dough rises.

The survey confirms there is no earthquake fault underlying the ridge. Besides, it would take a tremendous earthquake to move the rock and soil several vertical feet, Pennington said.

Pop goes the bedrock

Pop-ups are common in quarries in eastern North America, where rock removal releases pent-up strain in the underlying rocks. Pop-ups also appear after glaciers retreat; however, the last glaciers retreated from Menominee 11,000 years ago, and there is no quarrying in the area.

Rocks in the area are squeezed by plate tectonics, the researchers said. The Midwest is under pressure from squeezing coming from the West Coast and the East Coast.

Yet the region is not experiencing increased stress that would result in future larger earthquakes, Pennington added. The pop-up appeared in the uppermost bedrock, whereas large earthquakes strike miles deep. There have been two moderate earthquakes in Michigan since 2010, which were in different areas and unrelated to the crack, the scientists said.

One final clue was the loss, to lightning, of a giant white pine tree in the week before the crack appeared. ""The timing is remarkable, and it leads us to be suspicious, but the tree weighed less than a fully loaded dump truck,"" Pennington told Live Science.

""The earth is still full of surprises,"" Pennington said. ""It's just a little surprise, but it's still interesting and we're always learning more.""

""Working with Bunuel was wonderful. It was the pinnacle of my career in the cinema,"" the 84-year-old actress, who spoke with the media about ""Esta soy yo"" (This Is Me) at the Palacio de Mineria International Book Fair, told EFE on Friday.

Pinal, a native of the northwestern state of Sonora, said the peak of her career was when ""Viridiana"" was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival.

In her personal life she said one of her greatest experiences was the birth of her daughter Sylvia Pasquel in 1949, while in politics she mentioned being sworn in as a federal senator in 1997.

The 384-page autobiography examines all aspects of her life, although she devotes most of her attention to her acting career and explains why she never succumbed to the siren's call of Hollywood.

Pinal said the decision was an easy one.

""I already had a name in Mexico. I was acting, doing theater and movies. It was a good opportunity, but the truth is I didn't want to go; I was really enjoying myself and I'm still enjoying myself.

He also called out Google's initial silence on the matter, and said the case was being closely watched by Chinese authorities.

Forbes says that the FBI could resort to using the fingerprint from the phone owner's cadaver, or use a fingerprint copying hack that's been posted online and seems to work. But if the phone has been locked for more that 48 hours, the FBI will still need to know that passcode, which Apple says could take over 4 years to guess if it's complex enough. And those are the likely reasons the FBI have now come to Apple demanding they hack the phone. Stay tuned.

Follow-up to a story from Wednesday: that Hollywood hospital that had been reduced to keeping records like it was 1952 has paid a ransom to the hackers that locked up its servers.

He also said early reports the ransom was 9,000 bitcoins, or $3.4 million dollars, was false.

Stefanek said that paying the ransom was the ""quickest and most efficient way"" to get operations back online, which we think sets a bad precedent, but we also understand the urgency involved. Hackers have held other entities for ransom, including some small police departments, who typically paid less than one thousand dollars to get their data back.

Authorities in the South American country were quick to make the link last fall. The health minister last week said he was ""absolutely sure"" that the mosquito-borne virus is a cause.

But others aren't so certain. While the evidence has been mounting, so far it is circumstantial.

""The simple presence of the virus doesn't mean it caused the birth defect. It means there's a probability,"" said Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan epidemiologist.

The investigation is still in its early stages. It began after Brazilian doctors noticed an increase last fall in babies with a birth defect called microcephaly, which has a number of causes. The cases closely followed the country's first outbreak of the tropical virus Zika, which was thought to cause no more than a mild illness that clears up in a week.

Microcephaly hadn't been seen in past Zika outbreaks. Babies with the condition have a smaller than normal head and often have a smaller brain that hasn't developed properly. Lab tests have detected the virus in the brain tissue of a few babies with microcephaly.

Proving the cause is a bit like prosecuting a murder investigation, with Zika as the apparent killer but a lot of unanswered questions, said Dr. Ernesto Marques, a University of Pittsburgh microbiologist who is collaborating with Brazilian researchers.

""What you have so far, the victim is there, and you find a person right there that has a smoking gun in his hand,"" Marques said. ""But you still need to close the deal.""

The investigation poses special challenges. There's currently no good animal substitute for humans to study the virus. And it's not considered ethical to infect people, especially pregnant women, in an experiment to see what happens  not when there seems to be a real chance that a volunteer could be seriously harmed.

So researchers are turning to other kinds of studies to try to establish whether Zika or some other factor is causing the birth defect or, also, a paralyzing condition called Guillain-Barre. Five Latin America countries with Zika outbreaks are reporting an uptick in that condition in adults.

One method is quick-and-dirty research called a case-control study, which looks back in time after an illness or condition has occurred. For the birth defect research, that means recruiting a group of women with babies born with microcephaly and trying to sort out what may have happened during their pregnancy to spark the condition. For comparison, they will query women whose infants don't have the birth defect.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is involved in one such a study set to start next week in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. It will focus on 100 babies with microcephaly and at least 200 more without.

Investigators will take blood samples from the mothers to check for signs of an earlier Zika infection. They also will ask not only about Zika infections but other possible factors, like other germs or poisons in the environment. Some experts suggest that perhaps Zika needs an accomplice  like malnutrition or an infection with another tropical illness like dengue  to cause serious problems.

The CDC was in the coastal city of Salvador last month to help health officials with another look-back study, this one targeting Guillain-Barre. They tested 40 people who had the condition, and 80 people who didn't, said Dr. James Sejvar, who led the CDC team.

But such studies are hardly perfect. People often have trouble remembering every detail from six months ago  for example, when they might have been bitten by mosquitoes, the primary source of Zika infections.

Researchers say it's important to also do studies that follow people forward in time.

A large example: Colombia will be following 2,000 Zika-infected pregnant women to see what happens with them and their pregnancies, according to Dr. Marcos Espinal of the Pan American Health Organization.

In the Recife metropolitan area, Brazilian scientists will examine 200 babies with microcephaly and about 400 without, at two points in time, spaced 28 days apart.

""That will be the first one to tell us if there's strong evidence"" of Zika as a causal link, Espinal told reporters Thursday.

Espinal said results could come as early as April. But Marques  who is one of the study's researchers  said significant results could take until late summer.

In Brazil, Zika's possible link to microcephaly emerged in September, when a spike in babies born with the condition got the attention of Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, a pediatric neurologist at a hospital in northeast Recife that works with disabled children.

Initially, Van der Linden and other doctors looked for the usual causes of microcephaly, such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, HIV, and cytomegalovirus. None were found.

But most of the mothers had something in common: blotches and skin rashes early in their pregnancies that seemed consistent with Zika. That was the genesis of the link.

It's all been difficult to sort out, though, because Brazil wasn't keeping good track of microcephaly cases before Zika arrived. They're still determining how many of the reported cases are really microcephaly and involve a Zika infection.

One of the puzzling questions facing researchers: Why have so many severe health problems been reported in Brazil, but comparatively few in other Latin America or Caribbean countries with Zika? Will we soon see similar spikes elsewhere, or is the Brazilian setting somehow unique?

Health officials are closely watching Colombia, which had a Zika outbreak after Brazil and so far has not seen a spike in microcephaly cases. If there is, it would be apparent by June and would help finger Zika as the culprit, Espinal said.

It will take a combination of studies and laboratory evidence to finally determine if Zika is the villain it appears to be, experts say.

""This is going to be solved,"" said Dr. Farrah Mateen, a Harvard researcher. ""It's just a matter of doing the research in the right way.""

All the goals came in the second half, with Mati Fernandez, Cristian Tello and Nikola Kalinic scoring for Fiorentina to help it move four points clear of Inter Milan, which beat Sampdoria 3-1 on Saturday.

Roma can close the gap to two points later as the battle for the final Champions League spot heats up.

Lazio also plays later, at relegation-threatened Frosinone.

Sassuolo moved provisionally above Lazio with a controversial 3-2 victory over Empoli, which saw both teams reduced to 10 men in the first half.

Elsewhere, Genoa fought back to win 2-1 at Udinese, which had a last-minute penalty saved. Maxi Lopez also had a spot-kick saved as Torino was held 0-0 against Carpi.

It was an even match in Bergamo before Fiorentina finally broke the deadlock midway through the second half when Fernandez headed Tello's cross into the top left corner.

Tello got on the scoresheet himself nine minutes from time with his first goal for Fiorentina. The on-loan Barcelona forward sprung the offside trap from near the halfway line and although his inital effort was saved by Marco Sportiello, he tucked away the rebound.

Atalanta got back in the match three minutes later when Andrea Conti bundled the ball in from a corner but Fiorentina restored its two-goal advantage following good play between substitutes Borja Valero and Kalinic, who started and finished the move.

Mauricio Pinilla netted a consolation for Fiorentina in stoppage time, moments before Conti was sent off for a second yellow card for dissent.

Genoa moved provisionally six points clear of the relegation zone, and a point above Udinese, after goalkeeper Mattia Perin went from villain to hero.

Ali Adnan became the first Iraqi player to score a goal in Serie A with a free kick that Perin got his hands to but only succeeded in pushing it into his own net.

Alessio Cerci leveled with a second-half penalty after Duvan Zapata's handball and Diego Laxalt fired Genoa in front when he was the first to react when Orestis Karnezis could only parry Sebastien De Maio's 25-yard strike.

Udinese appeared to be on course to equalize in the final minute but Perin atoned for his earlier error by saving Antonio Di Natale's penalty.","[]"

2 p.m.

Pole-sitter Chase Elliott is out of the Daytona 500.

Just 19 laps into ''The Great American Race,'' the Sprint Cup rookie lost control of his No. 24 Chevrolet coming out of Turn 4 and slid into the grass infield. The front end of his car lifted off the ground, and the rough ride caused enough damage that his car had to be towed to the garage.

Elliott was transported to the infield care center, evaluated and released.

Carl Edwards and Regan Smith also were involved in the wreck, the first of the day.

Gerard Butler screamed the command to more than 100,000 fans, a tweaked version of the actor's famous ''This is Sparta'' line from the 2006 hit movie ''300.''

He gave the command for drivers to start their engines, and the Daytona 500 got under way a few minutes later.

Rookie Chase Elliott led the 40-car field to the green flag. Joey Logano is the defending champion.

NASCAR executive Mike Helton brought some humor to the pre-race driver meeting, a traditionally staid ceremonial recognition of dignitaries that concludes with drivers receiving one final briefing before the race.

Helton one-by-one introduced all the Hall of Fame drivers in attendance, with 2015 inductee Bill Elliott last. Elliott is a two-time Daytona 500 winner and former NASCAR champion, and his 20-year-old son will make his Daytona 500 debut Sunday.

Chase Elliott replaced Jeff Gordon in the iconic No. 24 Chevrolet and put it on the pole for the 500, so Helton simply introduced his Hall of Fame father as ''Chase's dad.''

He also noted that Hall of Famer Glenn Wood is attending his 70th consecutive Daytona 500, but wryly noted that it's only the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.''

''They did race down there on the beach, though,'' Helton smiled.

Ken Griffey Jr. says steroid-tainted slugger Barry Bonds deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.

Griffey is serving as honorary starter for the Daytona 500, where he will waive the green flag to start the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.'' Before he took his spot in the starter's stand Sunday, he met with the media and one of the first questions was about Bonds belonging in Cooperstown.

''Yeah,'' Griffey said after a long pause. ''I think that overall, when you look what people have done, yeah. It's not my vote, so I can't vote for him. But if you look at what he's done, those numbers speak for themselves.''

The polarizing home run king, Bonds is returning to the major leagues as hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Bonds is 0 for 4 in annual Hall of Fame balloting. He received 44 percent of the vote in January, a career high but far short of the 75 percent needed for induction.

Like Bonds, former home run king and admitted steroid user Mark McGwire also is back in baseball. He is the bench coach for the San Diego Padres.

Griffey declined to speculate whether being back in the game would help either one when it comes time to vote every year.

''I have no idea,'' Griffey said. ''My thing is I don't vote, so my opinion doesn't matter. It's up to the guys who do it for a living to decide what they want to do. I was honored by them voting for me. But it's up to these guys to determine if they get in or not. It's not up to me.''

As for the 500, Junior is going with Junior. Griffey and Dale Earnhardt Jr. have signed and exchanged items for charity over the years. Griffey even has a signed hood from one of Earnhardt's cars on display in his Orlando home.

''I've always been an Earnhardt family fan,'' Griffey said. ''I wore black batting gloves on Sunday when I played for the Reds.''

It's Daytona Day!

The 58th running of the Daytona 500 is Sunday, and although rookie Chase Elliott is on the pole, Hendrick Motorsports teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. is considered the man to beat in ''The Great American Race.''

Earnhardt and his car nicknamed ''Amelia'' have been nearly unstoppable at recent restrictor-plate races. Junior has four wins in six races with Amelia over the last 13 months.

Earnhardt says his team has been talked up quite a bit this week but he hopes people don't underestimate the competition. He says a lot of cars and drivers are capable of winning.

Driver Denny Hamlin believes only a handful of teams are capable of winning Sunday. Hamlin and his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth, Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards are among Earnhardt's toughest competition. Team Penske drivers Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano also are expected to contend.

However, all types of destinations in this part of Mexico are seeing bolstered tourist numbers. Direct flights from major U.S. cities have increased here. Passenger counts, both international and domestic, have risen as well.

Bookended by seaside rocks that protrude into warm Pacific Ocean waters, the relatively small Playa de los Muertos, or Beach of the Dead, features gentle waves, pelicans diving for fish and sunbathers lying on the sand. Vendors sell beer and grilled fish-on-a-stick, and two locals climb a palm tree to fetch coconuts.

But just beyond the laidback beach is a peninsula that hosts a new and posh 62-property development, highlighting that Sayulita, once a tranquil fishing village, continues to grow into one of Mexico's top tourism and retirement destinations.

The town was even featured in an offshoot of ABC's popular reality series ""The Bachelor: Paradise,"" though one local who watched the filming thought it was a telenovela.

""Every time I've said it can't get bigger, it does,"" said Jody Meacham of New Jersey after finishing a surfing session on Sayulita's main beach. Meacham has been visiting Sayulita for 25 years, back when there were ""more burros than cars."" ''I still love it. I come back every year,"" he said.

Located about 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta on Mexico's Pacific coast, Sayulita presents an alternative to the towering all-inclusive resorts that line the beaches south of it. However, all types of destinations in this part of Mexico are seeing bolstered tourist numbers. Direct flights from major U.S. cities have increased here. Passenger counts, both international and domestic, have risen as well.

In December, the federal Mexican tourism department named Sayulita a ""Pueblo Magico"" or ""Magic Town,"" positioning the town as the crown jewel of the Nayarit Riviera, the coastline of its home state. The naming also comes with the promise of federal money for upgrades, which residents say are needed. The town has grown to about 5,000 residents, plus the scores of visitors that cycle through.

Sewage and electricity services have had a hard time keeping up with the growth; ""aguas negras,"" or literally ""black waters,"" have spilled into the ocean.

""Any additional tourism development would worsen this disastrous health situation,"" said Indalecio Sanchez Rodriguez, an activist for the group Green Coast Alliance, which has criticized the area's growth.

The current main project is burying power lines under the town streets.

""It's bursting at the seams, the infrastructure,"" said Richard Brassard, an architect, who first visited Sayulita around 1970 after a friend read about it in a surfing book.

Sayulita's attractions are plentiful: surfing, charter fishing, seasonal whale-watching, lush-green jungle hikes and horseback riding, baby sea turtle releases, among others.

On the south end, its main beach still hosts small local fishing boats. Farther north, surfers ride waves as the town disappears into the jungle. Playa de los Muertos and Playa Carricitos provide quieter and more isolated alternatives within a few of miles. If it's not raining, take a walk to those beaches on the dirt roads lined by the dense forest.

Sayulita boasts chic restaurants to attract foodies and excellent street chow (Tacos El Ivan is top-notch and so is a cake stand named La Gorda, near the town square). Nightlife can be a dance party on the beach or the happy sounds of children playing at the central plaza.

Accommodations range from camping spots (El Camaron, located by the beach, is cheap, but reviews are mixed) to isolated luxury retreats (Teitiare, $400 a night).

We stayed at Playa Escondida, where accommodations range from bungalows ($200 a night during the high season) to penthouses perched on the hillside over a beach ($495 a night during high season). It was built on land Brassard used to own, and being an architect, he has designed the hotel's rooms and furniture. The hotel was used in a season of the ""Bachelor Paradise.""

The hotel was booked through the low season for the first time last year, Bassard said.

Back in Playa de los Muertos, the sun sets and the town cemetery behind the beach is lit up by candles placed on tombs as my girlfriend and I walk back to town.

Streets hum with activity. Motorbikes and cars buzz about while the sounds of live music, families, hawking vendors and even rowdy drunks fill the humid air. Many of the tourists transport themselves on golf carts.

""Now it's like Puerto Vallarta was back in the '60s. It's developed to that point,"" Bassard said.

The front-running Trump won 33 percent of the vote in the Republican South Carolina primary, roughly 11 percent ahead of challengers Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Ted Cruz, of Texas.

The win is Trumps second in the first three, early-state contests and now focuses the debate on whether any the five remaining candidates can stop him, in part by taking the support for Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign after a disappointing fourth-place finish on Saturday in South Carolina.

I guess you can always be stopped, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I have very good competition. ... They are very talented people.

In his South Carolina victory speech, Trump said, Lets put this thing away.

To be sure, Trump appears to be in a good position. Every Republican presidential candidate who has won New Hampshire and South Carolina has taken the party nomination. And he appears to have strong support in the Deep South as the primary season swings into the region next month.

Trump notably held a rally this summer in Mobile, Ala., that attracted an estimated 30,000 people.

Rubio and Cruz remain confident they can eventually get more votes as the GOP field continues to narrow, then overtake Trump.

The eventual winner will face either Democrat Bernie Sanders or front-runner Hillary Clinton, who on Saturday night won her partys Nevada caucus over Sanders 53-to-47 percent.

She defeated Sanders in Iowa, but lost to him in New Hampshire.

Rubio told Fox News Sunday that he has a real sense of optimism after South Carolina. However, Rubio said he is not trying to get other candidates, specifically Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished fifth in South Carolina, to drop out, which could give Rubio even more of the establishment vote now that Bush is out.

The sooner we coalesce, the better we can do as a party, he said. Its going to happen one way or another.

Cruz told ABCs This Week that Trump is a formidable candidate but polls show a majority of voters dont think he can beat Clinton.

You cannot come from him at the left, Cruz said of his primary strategy. You have to have a true conservative to win.

Clintons Nevada win came just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.","[]"

Gratuitous. Nasty. Petty. Spiteful. Insulting. Just plain rude. When the rhetoric of a major partys leading presidential candidate falls to this level, we should be scornful.

So, how is it OK when it isnt just a presidential candidate, but a president, who does it?

Donald Trumps policy of demeaning and snarking his political opponents has been a favorite habit of President Obama for the last eight years. Obama is perhaps the first president who believes that leading the country and playing to the beliefs of the extremists in his own party amount to the same thing, and like Trump fans, Obama fans are motivated in large degree by sheer hatred.

They love to hear their idol channel their rage by bashing people they dont like.

Obamas latest, silent insult  leaving a spokesman to explain he had better things to do on a Saturday than attend the funeral of a 30-year justice of the Supreme Court  isnt surprising when you consider the mean-spirited things he says virtually every time he steps in front of a microphone.

SpaceIL is one of the leading contenders among the 16 teams vying for the Lunar XPRIZE. The competition offers a $20 million prize to the first privately-funded team to land a rover on the moon by the end of 2017.

After landing on the moon, the craft must move 1,640 feet across the lunar surface and send high-definition pictures (including a selfie) and video back to Earth. The second team to successfully complete the mission will be awarded $5 million. Teams, however, must prove that 90 percent of their mission costs were funded by private sources.

Last year SpaceIL announced that it had signed a launch contract with SpaceX, securing a ticket to the moon on a Falcon 9 rocket. The Israeli team's launch is scheduled for the second half of 2017.

Related: Digital Mars map shows contours, legend

Rival team Moon Express announced a contract with Rocket Lab last year to launch three robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon starting in 2017.

In order to reduce the cost of the mission, SpaceIL will share its SpaceX ride with a number of satellites. SpaceX will start by releasing the satellites that will orbit the Earth first, we stay on the rocket last  they then ignite their engine and give us an extra boost, SpaceIL co-founder Yonatan Winetraub told FoxNews.com.

After separating from the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceIL will undertake the final stage of its journey to the moon, a trip that will take significantly longer than NASAs Apollo missions of the '60s and '70s.

Winetraub, a doctoral student in biophysics at Stanford, explained that on a direct trajectory, such as those used by the Apollo missions, it usually takes three days to get to the moon. However, SpaceILs craft is expected to take a couple of months to reach its destination after separating from the rocket. Because the Falcon 9s trajectory is not purely determined by the SpaceIL moon mission, SpaceIL will need to do more maneuvering in space to get the spacecraft to the moon, he said. We will carefully time SpaceILs engines burns to space to specific locations and for specific durations.

Related: Fears grow that Philae comet lander may never wake up

Then, of course, the spacecraft has to complete a tricky moon landing.

Landing is the most difficult part of the mission for multiple reasons, said Winetraub, noting that SpaceIL will control its own landing, removing the risk of delayed messages from mission control. It takes radio signals traveling at the speed of light 2 to 3 seconds in total to send and receive messages  the spacecraft is traveling at 2 kilometers a second at that point.

Instead, SpaceIL will use a sophisticated accelerometer and gyrometer called an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to help control its descent, a sensor that measures distance to the moon, and a Star Tracker device that uses stars for navigation. Its an advanced version of using the North Star for navigation, said Winetraub.

So, how will SpaceIL avoid the fate of the Philae lander, which made history when it landed on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014, but then bounced twice, leaving scientists uncertain about its exact location. After touching down in the correct location, the probes first bounce lasted 2 hours and took the craft up to a distance of more than half a mile. The second bounce was a small jump of just over an inch per second for 7 minutes, according to scientists.

Related: Scientists find evidence of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein

[Philae] was a completely different problem  the moons gravity is significantly stronger ... the Moons geometry is very well understood  we have got a good idea of where we will land, said Winetraub. Were doing our best  it is rocket science!

After landing on the moon, SpaceIL must then complete its video and picture tasks, as well as undertaking its short journey over the lunar surface.

Were going to do it in a single hop  were going to reignite the engines, do a little launch and land again, 500 meters [1,600 feet] to the side, said Winetraub.

SpaceIL will also conduct scientific experiments in conjunction with Israels prestigious Weizmann Institute to measure the lunar magnetic field. Its additional data on top of what the Apollo missions did, said the SpaceIL co-founder.

Related: Meteorite probably didn't kill man in India, NASA says

The spacecraft will use solar panels and a battery for power while on the moon. We plan [to operate it] for a few days, but it might be longer, said Winetraub. Were trying to land on the lunar sunrise  we need the place to be lit so that we have energy to power our solar panels; we need to be able to see the land and its cooler [during the sunrise], as opposed to when the sun is fully up.

The scientist, who researched Martian colonies at NASAs International Space University, hopes that the eventual success of SpaceIL will inspire young people. We want to put the spotlight back on science because its very important for the economy of Israel and the U.S. that kids will want to become engineers and scientists and one day, they could make breakthroughs of their own, he told FoxNews.com. We use the spaceship as a source for them to identify and choose science as careers.

SpaceIL partners include Israel Aerospace Industries, telecommunications company Bezeq, Tel Aviv University and the Technion  Israel Institute of Technology. Israel is a small country that has extreme innovation, said Winetraub.

Cultural historian Genevieve Cabrera told The Associated Press in an email that she found the discolored metal tag sticking out of the soil of a farm field on Saipan in early 2014. It was embossed with Davis' name, serial number, hometown and other information.

Cabrera recently gave the tag to members of Kuentai, a Japan-based organization that has found the remains of five 27th Division soldiers on Saipan. The group notified the AP this month about the dog tag's discovery in the hope that his relatives could be found. The AP tracked down members of the soldier's family with the help of Anthony Barger, the archivist for the Putnam County Public Library.

Kuentai representatives said they'll arrange to meet the Davis family in the U.S. to hand over the tag.

While it is relatively common to find canteens, weapons and even unexploded shells from the 100,000 Americans and Japanese who fought for 25 days on the 46-square-mile island, dog tags remain a rare find, Cabrera said. The tags, attached to a chain worn around the neck, were the only item of military-issued gear a soldier wore daily that included potentially life-saving information such as blood type and when a tetanus shot was administered.

A year before Davis died in the battle for Okinawa in April 1945, he earned one of the nation's highest military honors after surviving the bloody fighting on Saipan.

According to wartime records kept at the New York State Military Museum, home to many of the 27th Division's documents, Davis earned the Silver Star on Saipan in June 1944 for risking his own life to rescue a wounded comrade ""at a time when the American front was undergoing brutal Japanese artillery and mortar fire.""

Davis went into the Army in September 1941, three months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor drew the U.S. into WWII. He served in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division, a New York National Guard unit mobilized into active service in 1940.

Davis was with the 27th when it took part in the Okinawa invasion, which began on April 1, 1945. Three weeks later, he was shot by a Japanese sniper while again helping a wounded soldier, according to what Hollingsworth says military officials told the family. Davis died April 30, two months shy of his 28th birthday. Four years later, his body was brought back for reburial in his hometown.

Davis was born and raised on his family's farm in Roachdale in Putnam County, Indiana, 30 miles west of Indianapolis. His mother died when he was a young boy, and his father remarried. Davis had six siblings: an older brother, Harold, three half brothers and two half sisters, including Hollingsworth. The brothers have died. His other half-sister, Hazel Priest, 81, lives in Victoria, Texas, and several nieces and nephews live in Texas, Ohio and Indiana.

Hollingsworth said Tom Davis, of Victoria, a 57-year-old machinist who was named after his uncle, will likely get the dog tag.

"204","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Children breast-feeding after first birthday should take vitamin D","[]","Children who breast-feed, especially those living far from the equator, may get too little vitamin D, according to a new study in Canada.

The longer children breast-fed, even if they also ate solid food or were older than one year, the greater their odds of having low levels of vitamin D, researchers found.

Breast milk does not provide enough vitamin D, particularly for people in northern parts of the world, so the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that breast-fed children take supplements containing 400 International Units of vitamin D every day for the first year of life.

""We're not saying that breast-feeding is not a really great source of nutrition, but up here in the northern parts of the world not much vitamin D passes through breast milk,"" said study coauthor Dr. Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician and researcher at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.

The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breast-feeding through the first six months of life and continuing it in addition to solid foods for the first and second years as mutually desired by mother and child.

Maguire and his coauthors studied how long children were breast-fed and their blood vitamin D levels using data from about 2,500 healthy children aged 1 to 5 years in Toronto. Mothers reported how long their child had been breast-fed and doctors collected blood samples from the children.

Mothers also reported whether their child was taking vitamin D supplements.

Half of the kids had been breast-fed for 10 months or more, and 53 percent received vitamin D supplements.

As breast-feeding duration increased, blood vitamin D levels decreased for children who did not take supplements. For every one month additional breast-feeding time, the odds of abnormally low vitamin D levels increased by 6 percent, the researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health, online February 18.

The pattern was so consistent that researchers predicted 16 percent of 2-year-olds breast-feeding but not receiving extra vitamin D would be seriously deficient, and by age 3, that would rise to 29 percent.

For children who did take supplements, breast-feeding duration was not tied to vitamin D levels.

These results support the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation of vitamin D supplements during breast-feeding, regardless of duration, Maguire said.

Just because a child has reached a year of age doesn't mean vitamin D supplementation can be stopped, he said.

The supplements are available in most drugstores, but parents may forget to buy them, he said.

""Probably most North American pregnant women get vitamin D supplements during pregnancy, even if this is not a very substantial amount,"" Martin Hewison of The University of Birmingham in the U.K. told Reuters Health by email.

""Vitamin D-deficiency is so very common during pregnancy and lactation but is still generally ignored unless the child develops rickets,"" said Hewison, who was not part of the new study.","[]"

All photos courtesy of Giselle Behrens.

Lets face it, nothing says sexy like a one-of-a-kind standout pair of sky high heels.

For the past five years, Andrea Gomez, a shoe designer from Venezuela, has been channeling her deepest desires alongside countryman and well-established couturier Angel Sanchez.

When you work with a designer, you have to first really understand their inspiration and the collection, and then translate that for the shoes, Gomez, 29, told Fox News Latino.

With him I know that the shoes need to be beautiful alone, but not upstage the clothes, she said of Angel, who has dressed celebrities like Salma Hayek, Sandra Bullock, Beyonce and Eva Longoria.

Gomez launched her career in 2011 with a store in Caracas, where she resides, after getting a degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology and a one-year stint with DKNY in New York City.

She connected with Sanchez three years ago, a relationship that  she says  has helped put her name on the fashion map.

Im working now on designing a new more high-end collection, she said. My designs have evolved from when I first launched, and the work Ive done for Angel has pushed my creative side.

New York Fashion Week came to an end Thursday with Fall/Winter collections featuring a ton of leather, a lot of lace, a bit of fur and surprisingly mountains of velvet. Silhouettes were mostly relaxed and many designers opted to show their collections in smaller and more intimate spaces.

Gomez said that her collection, which she sells online and through her two Caracas stores, tends to be more practical and traditional than what she creates for Fashion Week.

She described her aesthetic as feminine, but edgy with chunky heels.

In general I think of my line as young and colorful, very summery year-round, as Venezuela offers mostly warm weather, Gomez said.

Called the Ocean Explorer, it simulates a scientific exploration as visitors ride through multiple aquariums where digital technology is used to inspire them to protect the oceans.

Related Image Expand / Contract The ride is meant to be a scientific exploration as visitors ride through multiple aquariums. (Sea World)

The three-minute experience will be like on a miniature submarine, which includes an onboard digital navigation dashboard, as well as a few other surprises along the journey, such as close-up views of huge octopuses and spider crabs, along with hundreds of colorful jellyfish.

Im extremely excited about Ocean Explorer and I know our guests, of all ages, are going to love this fun, interactive and educational new area of the park, said John Reilly, SeaWorld San Diego president. The opportunity to see and learn about some of the oceans most fascinating creatures, coupled with a mix of distinctive rides and activities, will give our visitors a meaningful experience only SeaWorld can create, he said.

Sea World says it's on track for a late spring opening next year and comes a few months after Parks & Entertainment Chief Executive Joel Manby said the company was putting on hold a $100-million plan to double the volume of the San Diego park's killer whale tanks and would divert a significant portion of that budget to a marketable attraction.

SeaWorld has been struggling with flagging sales since the 2013 release of the documentary ""Blackfish,"" that accused the park of poor treatment of its orca whale population. SeaWorld representatives have said that the film is inaccurate and the park has launched a $10-million advertising campaign defending its treatment of whales and promoting SeaWorld's work to benefit animals. The company also pledged an additional $10 million last year to fund conservation of orcas in the wild.

This latest attraction is part of its re-imaging as a sea life conservation park.

Ocean Explorer's three-minute-long submarine excursion will be one of five planned rides, including a ""wave swinger"" that is modeled after a similar attraction at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. In the Ocean Explorer version, individuals will be suspended in chairs from the tentacles of a giant rotating jellyfish as they fly through thousands of real bubbles.

Our guests response to new attractions has always been tremendously positive, said Reilly. The scope of Ocean Explorer demonstrates our ongoing commitment to creating new and fresh attractions, exhibits and events that provide the exciting, educational and entertaining experiences SeaWorld is known for.","[]"

Click here to subscribe to FOX411s YouTube channel

A few dozen people who comprised Lee's intimate circle gathered Saturday at a church in the small Alabama town of Monroeville, which the author used as a model for the imaginary town of Maycomb, the setting of her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Lee died Friday at age 89.

Lee's longtime friend, history professor Wayne Flynt, eulogized her in a ceremony at First United Methodist Church. Afterward, her casket was taken by silver hearse to an adjacent cemetery where her parents, A.C. Lee and Frances Finch Lee, and sister, Alice Lee, are buried. A spray of red and white roses covered the family headstone at the cemetery

Flynt said he delivered a eulogy that Lee specifically requested years ago. Entitled ""Atticus Inside Ourselves,"" it was a tribute Flynt gave in 2006 when she won the Birmingham Pledge Foundation Award for racial justice. Flynt said Lee liked the speech so much that she wanted him to give it as her eulogy.

""I want you to say exactly that,"" Flynt quoted Lee as saying at the time. ""Not one thing more, and not one thing less.""

""If I deviated one degree, I would hear this great booming voice from heaven, and it wouldn't be God,"" Flynt said in an earlier interview.

Details of the service were fiercely guarded. The author, who for decades had declined media interviews, had wanted a quick and quiet funeral without pomp or fanfare, family members said.

""We obeyed her wishes,"" said Jackie Stovall, Lee's second cousin.

The town was appropriately somber a day after their native daughter's death. Black bows adorned the doors of the old courthouse in Monroeville where Lee as a child, like her literary creation Scout Finch, would peer down from the balcony as her lawyer father tried his cases in the courtroom.

Mockingbirds chirped and frolicked among blooming camellia bushes outside the courthouse on a warm Alabama morning that teased the early arrival of spring.

Jared Anton, of Hollywood, Florida, sat outside the old courthouse during part of a planned vacation through the South that coincided with Lee's death.

Anton said reading the book  in which attorney Atticus Finch defends a wrongly accused African-American man  was one of the reasons he decided to become a lawyer.

""It had an impact on me when I was younger. I wanted to do the right thing, to stand up to people, to defend the innocent, if you will,"" Anton said. ""It is the greatest American novel. Name one that really has had more of an impact on Americans than that book.""

The Southern town was home to childhood friends Truman Capote and Lee, giving rise to its self-given nickname of the literary capital of the South. Ann Mote, owner of the Ol' Curiosities & Book Shoppe in Monroeville, said she thinks the town will always be linked to Lee.

""She's a part of it and always will be,"" Mote said.

Tributes to Lee's novel dot the town. The courthouse is a museum that pays homage to her creation. There's the Mockingbird Inn on the edge of town and a statute of children reading ""Mockingbird"" in the courthouse square. Tickets go on sale in a week for the city's annual ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" play, Mote said. A black mourning bow donned the top of the sign at the bookstore, where a stack of hardcopy ""Mockingbird"" books sat the counter along with a DVD of the movie.

The town this summer had a celebration for the release of ""Go Set a Watchman""  Lee's initial draft of the story that would become ""Mockingbird""  even though many residents had ambivalent feelings about its release.

""She was an Alabama treasure. She was an international treasure. We were all blessed by her life and her work as we are diminished by her passing,"" said Cathy Randall, a friend of Lee's for the past 30 years.

Flynt and Randall said they had recently visited Lee at the Monroeville assisted living facility where she had lived for several years because of declining health. Flynt said Lee was ""savagely witty.""

""She was still the most brilliant person in any room,"" Randall said.","[]"

They are owned and operated by Mexican drug cartels, and theres nothing we can currently do to stop them.

The proliferation of small, cheap UAVs (aka drones) has raised a litany of security concerns, from interference with commercial aviation to possible delivery systems for weapons. Along the U.S. southern border, the Mexican cartels are operating drones as intelligence gathering tools. Cartels traditionally have employed falcones (Spanish for falcons)people who perch on points along the border to monitor border patrol movements, collecting information that smugglers could exploit to outmaneuver Americas border security efforts.

Mexican cartels and criminals are operating with impunity, and it is having a definite impact on the volume of drug smuggling and illegal immigration. What steps are we going to take to address this fast-growing, fast-flying problem? - Nelson Balido

Today, those falcones are in the process of being replaced with a fleet of drones that fly along the U.S.-Mexico border, giving comprehensive real-time intelligence to smugglers on the location and movement of border patrol and other law enforcement officers and vulnerabilities in our border security infrastructure. This presents a long list of fatal challenges for all of Americas border security efforts. Foremost among them:

* With constant, real-time video of the U.S.-Mexico border, drug smugglers, human traffickers and others can simply identify the areas where law enforcement agents are not operating and cue an illegal crossing at those points. That easily defeats all of our randomized patrols and quick-response capabilities.

* Knowing where our patrol efforts are temporarily weakest, cartels and others can send a UAV with a payload of narcotics into the United States. They dont even need to worry about the mechanics of dropping cargo and bringing the drone back. The drug payload is worth tens or even hundreds of times more than the UAV, making the drone more or less disposable. This scenario has been occurring since 2010, and in April last year, a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near Calexico, California.

* With aerial video, criminals on the Mexican side could record identifying features of the law enforcement officers themselves and target them (or their loved ones) for violence. We cannot allow gangs of violent criminals to accumulate a photo roster of our dedicated agents who are already risking their lives to protect the border.

These serious implications for cartel-run UAVs are concerning enough, but more troubling still is that the United States has no capacity to stop them.

What options do we have? A sharpshooter with a long-range rifle could attempt to shoot down the drones, but given the size of the target and the speed at which it can travel and change direction, there is a good chance there will be missed shots, and who could say where that errant bullet might land or what it might strike?

The Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine has told the Border Patrol they cannot take steps of their own because airspace is their exclusive domain. For years, the Border Patrol has tried to obtain small UAVs for themselves that they could launch from the back of pickup trucks to do their own reconnaissance. Yet, currently, Air and Marine can only bring helicopters to bear. The result is that they would be using extremely high-powered machine guns on airships costing more than $1,500 an hour plus crew to try and take down a very nimble and low-flying UAV worth a fraction of that cost, to say nothing of the missed shots that would hail bullets on the ground below. This is the equivalent of bringing a Hellfire missile when all you need is a fly-swatter.

Some might think we can track the drones and trace them back to their operator. However, cartels have been sending much larger, manned ultra-light planes across the border for years, and we have a hard time even tracking those. If we cant always track a plane, we have no hope of keeping tabs on a legion fast, low-flying drones.

Perhaps more adventurously, we could consider some sort of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device that fries the UAVs circuits, but that would likely take out some of Americas border security technology in the process, and it would bring unforeseeable but certain unintended consequences.

And even if we did have some innovative response to this massive problem, U.S. Border Patrol agents cannot launch and use what they dont have. Given woefully insufficient attention and budget from Washington, theres no reason to believe new technology to address this situation is coming soon.

The result is the United States has no means by which to counter the criminal use of UAV activities along the border. Meanwhile, the cartels and other criminal organizations do have a way to counter American UAVs. It has been reported that some of the UAVs American law enforcement are using for operations lack critical security modules that can prevent GPS spoofing; that is, a simple cyberattack that sends the UAV incorrect GPS coordinates, causing it to fly away from its intended route.

This is bad all the way around. Mexican cartels and criminals are operating with impunity, and it is having a definite impact on the volume of drug smuggling and illegal immigration. What steps are we going to take to address this fast-growing, fast-flying problem? I have no idea.

And frankly, neither does anyone else.

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","[]"

Jeb Bush, though, abruptly suspended his campaign after a distant finish, leaving unclear to whom his supporters will gravitate.

But Trump, at his victory rally, seemed to dismiss the notion that other candidates would benefit from Bush's exit.

""[The pundits] don't understand that as people drop out, I'm going to get a lot of those votes,"" Trump said.

He said the primary race lately has been ""mean"" and ""vicious"" but: ""When you win, it's beautiful.""

He closed by saying, ""Lets put this thing away, and lets make America great again.""

Trump's victory is not by the big double-digit margin that pre-election polls had suggested. Still, this makes back-to-back victories for Trump, who more than doubled the vote of his closest competitor in New Hampshire last week.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio remain locked in a battle for second place.

With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Rubio is narrowly leading Cruz with just over 22 percent. Trump leads with 33 percent.

Both candidates were staying confident.

""After tonight, this has become a three-person race, and we will win the nomination, Rubio told supporters.

Rubio placed third in Iowa, but stumbled in New Hampshire following a rough debate performance. He vowed to bounce back, and entered the South Carolina contest enjoying support from the state's popular governor, Nikki Haley, and other state leaders.

Senior Cruz aides maintained the Texas senator remains well-positioned going into looming Southern state primaries, since he won Iowa and placed third in New Hampshire.

Lagging far behind Saturday were the three other candidates  Ohio Gov. John Kasich, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Bush, all of whom appear to be stuck in single digits.

While Bush suspended his campaign, Carson vowed to stay in, as did Kasich.

The GOP race heads next to Nevada and after that to Super Tuesday, representing a delegate gold mine. Even South Carolina, with 50 delegates, is the most valuable GOP primary to date. As the winner, Trump would get the lion's share.

South Carolina, historically, also is a prized contest for Republican candidates as it has a knack for picking the eventual nominee  the primary winner has gone on to claim the nomination in every race since 1980, except for 2012 when Newt Gingrich won.

The state has a reputation as well for bringing out bare-knuckle campaign tactics, and this year was no exception. Charges of dirty politics flew on all sides in the lead-up to Saturdays primary, with robo-calls and misleading websites surfacing about the candidates.

The race tightened in the final days, but not enough to shake Trump's long-time advantage there.

Trump had enjoyed a 13-point lead in the latest average of pre-election polls by Real Clear Politics. Fox News exit polls indicate significant numbers of late-deciding voters ended up supporting Cruz and Rubio, causing both candidates to perform more strongly than pre-election polling suggested.

Trump, according to exit polls, was still the overwhelming favorite among voters who said theyre angry with the federal government. Cruz, though, had the edge among voters who said their top issue is terrorism.

But of the three other candidates, only Kasich has made it onto the leaderboard in the three opening contests. With Bush out, he's the last governor standing in the race.

Bush, the former Florida governor, entered the 2016 presidential race as an early favorite, but fell in the polls steadily, despite having had a couple strong debate performances in recent weeks.

The presidency is bigger than any one person. It is certainly bigger than any candidate, he said in suspending his campaign.

SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY RESULTS

Kasich, who placed second in New Hampshire, had low expectations in South Carolina. He is looking toward more moderate states that vote later in March.

Trump's victory, meanwhile, could foreshadow a solid performance in the collection of Southern states that vote on March 1. Victories in those Super Tuesday contests could put the billionaire in a commanding position in the delegate count, which determines the nomination.

Trump won in South Carolina after the Democrats held caucuses earlier in the day in Nevada, where Hillary Clinton was projected the winner.

Obama, in California this week for a fundraising swing, signed proclamations establishing three regions as national monuments  Mojave Trails, Castle Mountains (both in the Mojave Desert) and Sand to Snow in the Sonoran Desert.

The White House says the designations will nearly double the amount of public land that Obama has designated as national monument status since taking office.

""In addition to permanently protecting incredible natural resources, wildlife habitat and unique historic and cultural sites, and providing recreational opportunities for a burgeoning region, the monuments will support climate resiliency in the region ...,"" the White House said in a statement.

The designations will also connect those regions to other protected government land, including Joshua Tree National Park, the Mojave National Preserve and 15 other federal wilderness areas.

Mojave Trails National Monument, at 1.6 million acres, is by far the largest of the three new ones.

Sprawling across the vast Mojave Desert, it contains ancient lava flows, spectacular sand dunes, ancient Native American trading routes and World War II-era training camps. It also contains the largest remaining undeveloped stretch of America's Mother Road, historic Route 66.

Castle Mountains National Monument, also in the Mojave Desert, links two mountain ranges as it covers nearly 21,000 acres that hold numerous important Native American archaeological sites. The area is also home to golden eagles, bighorn sheep, mountain lions and other wildlife.

Sand to Snow National Monument rises from the floor of the Sonoran Desert to the 11,503-foot peak of Mount San Gorgonio, Southern California's tallest alpine peak.

Its diverse landscape includes the headwaters of the state's Santa Ana and Whitewater rivers and is home to 240 species of birds and 12 endangered or threatened species of wildlife. It also contains an estimated 1,700 Native American petroglyphs and 30 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.

The ad, which aired during the Grammys this week, features a montage of beloved cat videos, from a feline riding a Roomba, to a kitty fake-playing a keyboard. But along with this cuteness comes an unexpected public health message: Smoking near your pet is hazardous to its health.

""Cats are twice as likely to get cancer if their owner smokes,"" proclaims a voice in the video, which was produced by a nonprofit organization called the Truth Initiative. ""Smoking = no cats = no cat videos,"" the video warns. The ad encourages viewers to ""Be the generation that ends smoking.""

The ad generated a buzz on Twitter, with the hashtag ""#catmageddon."" Tobacco control and public health experts said they were pleased with the video.

""It's very clever,"" said Andrea Spatarella, a nurse practitioner at Northwell Health's Center for Tobacco Control in Great Neck, New York. Smokers with pets are often surprised to learn that a tobacco habit can affect animals too, she said.

The new video ""may bring awareness to somebody that they're not only damaging their own heath, but [also] damaging the health of a pet they love dearly,"" Spatarella said. [Kick the Habit: 10 Scientific Quit-Smoking Tips]

God bless dad for his faith, said the Rev. Paul Scalia, one of Justice Scalia's nine children, who led the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The deeper he went in his faith, the better public servant he was. God bless dad for his love of his family.

The roughly two-hour-long service was attended by such leaders in government and law as Vice President Joe Biden, former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 95-year-old retired Justice John Paul Stevens and the remaining eight high court justices.

Among them were Justice Clarence Thomas who read from the New Testament.

There was no eulogy in a service free of bipartisan politics.

However, the Rev. Scalia, a Catholic priest serving the diocese of Arlington, Va., shared some personal moments from his fathers life.

Scalia said his father once unknowingly stood in his line to confess sins, a Roman Catholic sacrament.

 Like heck Im confessing to you,  Scalia recalled his father later saying. The feeling was mutual.

Scalia, 79, died unexpectedly last weekend at a remote Texas ranch. He had spent nearly three decades on the high court.

The service, which began on an overcast day, concluded with the funeral procession headed to a private burial amid sunlight breaking through a grey sky.

Scalias flag-draped casket was brought to the church Saturday morning, in a short trip from the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Scalia's other sons and his sons-in-law served as pallbearers, carrying the casket into and out of the basilica, the countrys largest Roman Catholic church.

In additon to Scalia's wife of 55 years and their nine children and dozens of grandchildren, other dignitaries at the service included members of Congress and several federal judges who are considered possible replacements for Scalia. Among them were Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett and Chief Judge Merrick Garland, all of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Obama did not attend, despite criticism from some Republicans.

However, the president and first lady Michelle Obama were among the more than 6,000 people who paid tribute to Scalia at the Supreme Court building on Friday. His casket rested on a funeral bier that first held President Abraham Lincoln's casket after his assassination.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama's decision about the Mass was a ""respectful arrangement"" that took into account his large security detail.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, who also participated in the service, acknowledged the Scalia familys desire for a simple, parish-family mass, as much as possible.

Scalias unexpected death has touched off a sharp debate in Washington and across the country about whether Obama should nominate a replacement in his final roughly 10 months of office and whether he would attempt to make recess appointment -- appoint somebody to the high court while Congress is in recess over the extended Presidents Day weekend or during future recesses.

Republicans and others say the next president, who takes office in January 2017, should submit the nomination to the Congress.

GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz interrupted his campaign ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary to attend the Mass.

The Texas senator has been among those urging the Senate not to consider replacing Scalia until after the November election.

The GOP-led Senate is not expected to approve any appointment by Obama, who said after Scalias death he would make a consideration in time due.

Obama said Tuesday that he would not make a recess appointment full stop. But he said he would nominate somebody who would be indisputably qualified and whom any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

Never before had a funeral for a Supreme Court justice been held at the basilica. Three popes have visited the basilica: Pope John Paul II in 1979, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 and Pope Francis last year.

"226","foxnews","","Is Joe Gibbs Racing the biggest threat to Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s third Daytona 500 win?","['Daytona Beach', 'Fox Sports']","Since first unloading at Daytona International Speedway last weekend, the Joe Gibbs Racing cars have been stout and, in some cases, even dominant.

Denny Hamlin won the Sprint Unlimited.

Matt Kenseth qualified on the outside of the front row.

Kyle Busch won his Can-Am Duel.

Carl Edwards finished fourth in his Duel to cement a 10th-place starting spot.



While there are certainly some strong non-JGR cars in the field -- two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. being chief among them -- all signs point toward the Gibbs boys being a force in Sunday's 58th running of The Great American Race.

This much is certain: You'll be hard-pressed to find a more confident bunch, which is seeking to deliver Toyota's first win in the 500 and the first for JGR in this race since 1993.

""We've had fast race cars all week,"" said Edwards, a second-year JGR driver. ""Joe Gibbs Racing has worked really hard over the winter and it really shows. I had a lot of fun racing in the Sprint Unlimited. It was really neat to see Denny Hamlin out in front and stay out there. ... We have fast race cars, we qualified well, our cars drive well and they have a ton of speed. We are just going to have a good time and enjoy it.""

Of the four JGR drivers, only Kenseth -- a two-time Daytona 500 winner -- has captured the sport's biggest race. But of the four JGR drivers, the 2003 Sprint Cup champion also has the steepest hill to climb. He'll be forced to drop to the rear of the field in a backup car after his primary was badly damaged in a wreck on the final lap of his Can-Am Duel.

Earnhardt Jr., arguably the favorite on the shortlist of Daytona favorites, isn't willing to bet against Kenseth or any of the JGR drivers, for that matter.

""Denny's car is fast, he's smart,"" Earnhardt Jr. told FOXSports.com after Saturday's XFINITY Series race at Daytona. ""The 18 (Busch), obviously he won the Duel. He's a hell of a race car driver. Matt's won a couple Daytona 500s. I don't care if he's in a backup; that's still a good race car. And the 19 (Edwards). ...

""There's 25 cars that can win this race, maybe more. I mean, you got to do the right things and be smart, but they're going to be up there. It ain't going to be easy.""

Hamlin, who finished second to Earnhardt Jr. in the 2014 Daytona 500 and has enjoyed a superb overall Speedweeks, feels good about where his No. 11 Toyota stacks up to the competition.

""We have certainly shown that we have the speed in the car that we need to win at Daytona,"" Hamlin said. ""It's just a matter of putting it all together in the big race on Sunday. We have put ourselves in position to win the Daytona 500 the last few years, but it hasn't all come together yet. There are so many other variables involved that need to go your way to win the 500, and hopefully they will come together for our FedEx team this weekend.""

Busch, who led 35 of the 60 laps in his Duel, missed last year's Daytona 500 while cooped up in a Daytona Beach hospital with a broken foot and leg suffered in the previous day's XFINITY Series race.

Does the reigning Sprint Cup champion feel like the fabled 2.5-mile superspeedway perhaps owes him one after last year's Speedweeks disaster?

""No, I don't think so,"" Busch told FOXSports.com. ""There's been a lot of guys that maybe have thought that, maybe have discarded that theory over the years. I've kind of discarded it. I don't think you're ever owed anything.

""I think certain things just come back through cycle. ... I think if I could end up in Victory Lane on Sunday, then I certainly think it would kind of come full circle, essentially. I'd love to have that happen, but I'm not expecting anything from the racetrack or the racing gods to make that happen.""","[]"

"230","foxnews","2016-02-18 00:00:00","To win in 2016 GOP must close technology gap with Democrats","['Van Hipp']","It was July 2012. I was a member of Mitt Romneys National Finance Committee and, with the polls beginning to tighten, was feeling encouraged about his prospects to win the White House. That was until I spoke to Charles Harvey, one of the technology whizzes that the National Republican Congressional Committee brought in during the early 1990s to revamp their computer system, which helped give the GOP a technological edge in its 1994 takeover of the Congress.

He looked me in the eye and said, Romney is doomed.

He went on to tell me how the technology the campaign was using for its Get Out The Vote (GOTV) efforts was far inferior to that of the Obama campaign.

He then told me that there were other off-the-shelf solutions better than what the GOP had, but that most of those were from smaller companies that didnt have the contacts or the political consultants to get to the decision-makers.

He then specifically told me what was missing from the GOPs technology effort and how those gaps could be overcome in 30-45 days if the right people actually understood technology and moved quickly enough.

I reached out to friends close to GOP leadership to express my concern and received the expected Weve got everything covered and dont need any help response.

Well, on Election Day, November 6, 2012, the Romney campaigns GOTV app, known as ORCA, was a total flop.

ORCA crashed repeatedly. Grassroots volunteers at the local level were frustrated and many eventually quit even trying to use the system.

After the election returns came in and word began to leak out that the GOPs GOTV technology platform didnt even work, I remembered my conversation with Charles Harvey four months earlier.

He was right.

In this day and age of ever-increasing technology, the Romney campaign had two strikes against it from the start as a result of using a technology platform that was significantly inferior to the Democrats.

In essence, from a technology standpoint, the GOP was driving a Rambler, and the Democrats were driving a Rolls-Royce on Election Day.

Real technology experts were further horrified when it was revealed that the GOP never had a dry run test of ORCA to see how the app would even work over the Internet. The first time they tried it out was on Election Day itself.

There is still a real technology gap between the GOP and the Democratic Party.

The GOP can nominate the best candidate and have the best message, but it will lose again in 2016 if it doesnt close the technology gap that exists at the national level.

Over 90 million eligible voters did not vote in 2012. The votes are there for conservatives if they can close the technology gap and properly target their voters.

Interestingly, Mitt Romney actually won independent voters in 2012, while John McCain lost the independent vote in 2008, and yet they both got about the same number of popular votes. That further confirms that the GOP did a lousy job of turning out its base in 2012.

Reagan campaign veteran and Republican media strategist Marc Rotterman says, The two best run campaigns Ive seen in my lifetime were Reagan 1980 and Obama 2008. Reagan had the message and Obamas use of technology and data was second to none. To date, Im not sure the GOP has caught up. Rottermanss concerns are what worry knowledgeable observers on the right about 2016.

In talking with advisers to a number of GOP presidential campaigns, none have confidence in the Republican National Committees GOTV and analytics technology. One top aide even quipped, Their data analytics technology is only about fundraising.

Harper Reed was the Obama-Biden Chief Technology Officer who built a technology platform to make the process of voter contact more efficient and in real time.

On the right, no one understands this better than Voter Gravity CEO, Ned Ryun. Ryun says, The goal is to have on a mass scale high value, live contacts with targeted voters that are tracked in real time. Thats what technology is about: making that process more efficient.

Recently, Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasichs campaigns have talked openly about their analytics technology. Kasich is even using a data mining technology that targets possible supporters by looking not only at online data, but also off-line data like high school yearbooks and church lists.

Republicans need to be smart, not only in getting the best technology, but also in ensuring that the platforms that theyre relying on arent owned by companies that are already in the tank for the Democrats. And donors to presidential campaigns, the RNC, and SuperPACS need to insist that their dollars are spent narrowing the technology gap with Democrats.

The growing importance of having the right technology to win presidential elections is not confined to America. The Finnish outfit ZEFs electoral engine and voting aid technology has been highly successful and was used in last years British parliamentary elections.

The 2016 election will be the most important one in our lifetime. Whomever we elect as commander in chief will face the most complex foreign policy and national security situation an American president has ever faced.

Its a narrow pathway for the GOP and there is no room for error. Having the most advanced technology, big data, analytics, and GOTV, and tying it together in one platform will ensure that the 2016 Republican presidential nominee at least has a level playing field.

Ken Griffey Jr. says steroid-tainted slugger Barry Bonds deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.

Griffey is serving as honorary starter for the Daytona 500, where he will waive the green flag to start the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.'' Before he took his spot in the starter's stand Sunday, he met with the media and one of the first questions was about Bonds belonging in Cooperstown.

''Yeah,'' Griffey said after a long pause. ''I think that overall, when you look what people have done, yeah. It's not my vote, so I can't vote for him. But if you look at what he's done, those numbers speak for themselves.''

The polarizing home run king, Bonds is returning to the major leagues as hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Bonds is 0 for 4 in annual Hall of Fame balloting. He received 44 percent of the vote in January, a career high but far short of the 75 percent needed for induction.

Like Bonds, former home run king and admitted steroid user Mark McGwire also is back in baseball. He is the bench coach for the San Diego Padres.

Griffey declined to speculate whether being back in the game would help either one when it comes time to vote every year.

''I have no idea,'' Griffey said. ''My thing is I don't vote, so my opinion doesn't matter. It's up to the guys who do it for a living to decide what they want to do. I was honored by them voting for me. But it's up to these guys to determine if they get in or not. It's not up to me.''

As for the 500, Junior is going with Junior. Griffey and Dale Earnhardt Jr. have signed and exchanged items for charity over the years. Griffey even has a signed hood from one of Earnhardt's cars on display in his Orlando home.

''I've always been an Earnhardt family fan,'' Griffey said. ''I wore black batting gloves on Sunday when I played for the Reds.''

The front-running Trump won 33 percent of the vote in the Republican South Carolina primary, roughly 11 percent ahead of challengers Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Ted Cruz, of Texas.

The win is Trumps second in the first three, early-state contests and now focuses the debate on whether any the five remaining candidates can stop him, in part by taking the support for Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign after a disappointing fourth-place finish on Saturday in South Carolina.

I guess you can always be stopped, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I have very good competition. ... They are very talented people.

In his South Carolina victory speech, Trump said, Lets put this thing away.

To be sure, Trump appears to be in a good position. Every Republican presidential candidate who has won New Hampshire and South Carolina has taken the party nomination. And he appears to have strong support in the Deep South as the primary season swings into the region next month.

Trump notably held a rally this summer in Mobile, Ala., that attracted an estimated 30,000 people.

Rubio and Cruz remain confident they can eventually get more votes as the GOP field continues to narrow, then overtake Trump.

The eventual winner will face either Democrat Bernie Sanders or front-runner Hillary Clinton, who on Saturday night won her partys Nevada caucus over Sanders 53-to-47 percent.

She defeated Sanders in Iowa, but lost to him in New Hampshire.

Rubio told Fox News Sunday that he has a real sense of optimism after South Carolina. However, Rubio said he is not trying to get other candidates, specifically Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished fifth in South Carolina, to drop out, which could give Rubio even more of the establishment vote now that Bush is out.

The sooner we coalesce, the better we can do as a party, he said. Its going to happen one way or another.

Cruz told ABCs This Week that Trump is a formidable candidate but polls show a majority of voters dont think he can beat Clinton.

You cannot come from him at the left, Cruz said of his primary strategy. You have to have a true conservative to win.

Clintons Nevada win came just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.","[]"

Experts from Binghamton University studied hundreds of ancient items found on the shores of Easter Island, which is also known as Rapa Nui. Previously, the artifacts were thought to be spear points, but analysis reveals that they were likely general purpose tools.

Carved from obsidian, or volcanic glass, thousands of the triangular objects, known as mata'a, litter the surface of the island.

We found that when you look at the shape of these things, they just don't look like weapons at all,"" explained Carl Lipo, professor of anthropology at Binghamton University and study lead, in a press release. ""When you can compare them to European weapons or weapons found anywhere around the world when there are actually objects used for warfare, they're very systematic in their shape. They have to do their job really well. Not doing well is risking death.""

Lipo and his team analyzed ""the shape variability"" of a photo set of over 400 mata'a.

""You can always use something as a spear. Anything that you have can be a weapon, said Lipo. But under the conditions of warfare, weapons are going to have performance characteristics. And they're going to be very carefully fashioned for that purpose because it matters...You would cut somebody [with a mata'a], but they certainly wouldn't be lethal in any way.""

Some scientists have estimated, that, at its height, Easter Islands population may have been as high as 20,000, but fell over centuries after the islands trees and palms were cut down to build canoes and transport its famous giant statues. One theory suggests that the deforestation led to soil erosion, impacting the islands ability to support wildlife and farming, and the collapse of its civilization.

When the Dutch arrived at the island in 1722, its population was 3,000 or less. Only 111 inhabitants were living on Easter Island by 1877.

Other experts, however, have questioned whether Easter Island ever supported a large population, citing instead the arrival of Europeans, who brought diseases and took islanders away as slaves.

""What people traditionally think about the island is being this island of catastrophe and collapse just isn't true in a pre-historic sense, said Lipo. Populations were successful and lived sustainably on the island up until European contact.

We got this question from a viewer:

Dear Dr. Manny,

My 6-month-old daughter who is usually a great sleeper has been waking up several times a night crying and is just generally cranky all of a sudden. I think she is teething. What can I do to help soother her discomfort?

Thanks,

Tara

Do you have health questions? If you have health questions just email Dr. Manny: drmanny@foxnews.com

Well, Tara, you may be right. Most babies start teething between four and seven months. Signs can include:

- Excessive drooling

- Chewing on solid objects

- Irritability or crankiness

- Tender, swollen gums

- Night waking

- Ear pulling

Its important you keep a close eye on your baby because some of the signs of teething can actually be symptoms of illness.

But, if she is about to cut her first tooth, there are things you can do to help ease the pain:

- Offer teething toys or a clean, wet washcloth to provide counterpressure on the gums.

- Rub babys gums using a clean finger or moistened gauze.

- Try giving her cold water in a bottle or cold food in a mesh feeder is shes six months or older.

- Dry off excess drool that can cause skin irritation.

- If all else fails, you can try giving her acetaminophen, but only after youve talked to her doctor.

Avoid using any numbing agents which have been shown to put children under the age of 2 at risk for reduced oxygen in the blood and always talk to your childs doctor before trying any home remedies.","[]"

The two men who fired the shots were not immediately arrested, as dozens of police officers searched and as others went from store to store at the Columbiana Mall letting scared shoppers know it was safe to leave, Columbia Police Chief Skip Holbrook said.

The incident began as a fight between two people about 7 p.m. in front of the Kay's Jewelers near the food court, Holbrook said.

The men ""pulled guns and fired in the air,"" Holbrook said.

Investigators initially thought a third man was involved in the fight, but surveillance camera footage shows he was trying to break it up, the chief said.

The two men ran out of the mall and have not been found.

Several teams of heavily armed officers could be seen searching around the mall and the dozens of stores and restaurants nearby. Two hours after the shooting, police officers were still going into businesses and telling scared shoppers behind locked doors it was safe to leave.

""When we clear the mall and the other areas, we think it will shed light on what occurred,"" Holbrook said.

Shoppers described massive panic after the shots rang out.

""They were all running and leaving stuff behind, like there were snakes behind them,"" said Stacey Haltiwanger, owner of the Sassy and Classy boutique in the mall.

Pamela Paras was at the mall with her two daughters, ages 7 and 12, in the Dazzle Up clothing store about seven doors down from the shooting. She said it first sounded like someone dropped a heavy tray in the food court. Then people began running outside and an employee rushed to drop the security gate and turn off the lights.

Shoppers and their children hid under clothing racks in the dark for more than 30 minutes before officers came in and hustled them all out.

""There were several small children crying. As an adult, you really couldn't lose it. But we were all thinking about making sure we were in front of the children if a gunman came in,"" Paras said.

Several dozen people walked around outside the mall after the shooting because they left purses and keys inside and police weren't letting anyone back in. Authorities set up a place in a Toys R Us parking lot next door for people who got separated to reunite.

Dozens of police cars with lights flashing could be seen on the road around the mall, and traffic in the area was backed up for more than a mile. The mall has about 80 stores and is about 12 miles outside the capital's downtown, where three of the six remaining Republican presidential candidates were holding primary watch parties Saturday night.

Nearly four months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings, Connecticut has passed some of the toughest gun control measures in the nation. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)2013 Getty Images

The U.S. ambassador to Argentina, Noah Mamet, said the date of President Barack Obama's trip to the South American country, which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the coup d'etat that established the last Argentine dictatorship, is in no way related to that day in history.

""March 24 is a very significant day for all Argentines. Nonetheless, we must explain that the president's decision to travel on that date is because his visit to Argentina must coincide with his trip to Cuba, which is scheduled for March 21 and 22,"" Mamet said in a statement cited in the daily Clarin.

The diplomat did say, however, that the United States government ""shares with Argentina the defense of human rights as a universal principle.""

The fact is that the state visit by the U.S. president to the country governed by Mauricio Macri, announced Thursday for March 23-24, has caused bad feelings among a number of humanitarian associations because it comes on the date of the coup d'etat that put the last Argentine dictatorship (1976-1983) in power.

For example, the cofounder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo-Founding Line, Nora Cortinas, said Friday in a statement on La Red radio, that there is ""nothing funny"" about the president of the United States showing up on a day of such terrible memories.

""They (the U.S.) were the instigators of the dictatorships in the Southern Cone of Latin America. Besides, that is a country that constantly meddles in other countries, causing horror,"" Cortinas said, adding that she asks herself if ""this wasn't premeditated"" and whether ""they particularly chose this day,"" which would be ""very sadistic.""

On Friday it became known that the Argentine president will receive representatives of human rights organizations next Tuesday at the Casa Rosada as part of the commemorative ceremonies on the anniversary of the coup.

Meanwhile Mamet said that in the year he has been U.S. ambassador to Argentina, he has seen ""the enormous affection and respect"" that Argentines feel for Obama.

""I'm convinced that this visit will serve to consolidate that relationship looking toward the future,"" he said.

According to an affidavit for a protection order, Crowley said that after arguing with Manziel in his hotel room, the Cleveland Browns quarterback led her down a back stairwell to the valet.

Crowley allegedly told the valet that she was ""scared for her life,"" but the valet said that he didn't know what to do. At which point, Manziel threw her into the passenger seat of the car and they drove away.

Libya devolved into a failed state when NATO assisted Qaddafis radical jihadist opponents in killing him and then promptly abandoned the country. Left in the wake were two rival governments competing for power, which created space for Islamists to turn Libya into a cesspool of extremism.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to call the debacle American smart power at its best. Other presidential candidates still argue that it was the right thing to do.

How will the West ever learn anything if it cant identify its most obvious failures?

Libya has no central functioning government that can provide security for its citizens. ISIS fights to expand its caliphate along the Mediterranean to points as close as 200 miles from Europes vulnerable southern border. It controls Qaddafis hometown of Sirte. It has imposed Shariah law in the areas under its control. It exploits Libya as a base to export weapons, jihadists and ideology to Europe, other African countries and the Middle East.

Benghazi and Derna, which have long been hotbeds of radicalism, provided more fighters per capita to Afghanistan and Iraq than nearly any other area in the world. The difference between then and now is that Qaddafi kept the lid on the garbage can long before 2002-2003, when he became a reliable U.S. ally against radical Islam. He changed his behavior, gave up his nuclear weapons program, paid reparations to the victims of his atrocities and provided invaluable intelligence that disrupted numerous Islamist terror plots.

It represented a massive foreign policy success, and the U.S. thanked him by facilitating his murder.

Similarly, the West embraced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his struggles against Islamist forces, and then it threw him under the bus. Both Qaddafi and Mubarak did everything asked of them, but they ended up dead or in jail.

Any leader would really need to ask why he should trust NATO or the West. Is there any question why Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad does not negotiate an end to his countrys civil war and clings to Iran and Russia to keep him in power?

Iran cheated on its nuclear program for years. As a result, the U.S. gifted it with more than $100 billion  including $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars  and it hasnt changed its behavior in the slightest. In addition to its military ambitions, Iran will most assuredly spend the money on supporting Assad and its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, Africa and, yes, Europe.

Im amazed by some of the statements now coming from the coalition. The French defense minister is concerned about ISIS fighters blending in with refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Talk about restating the obvious. The British want troops to identify friendly militias in order to avoid targeting them in future airstrikes. Has something changed where we have improved the vetting of moderate militia groups?

NATO failed miserably in Libya and in Syria the first time around. Whats different now?

The only official who seems to make any sense is U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who said recently, The Libyans dont welcome outsiders intruding on their territory. He was referring to ISIS, but he might as well have been talking about the West. Libyans have not forgotten that NATO all but vanished once Qaddafi was killed.

Western foreign policy is in disarray. The scariest part is that supposed leaders dont even know it, and therefore they cant admit to previous mistakes. Allies that brought stability to the region are gone. Former and current antagonists benefited from Western incompetence.

Who would have predicted six years ago that those rulers battling Islamist terror would be deposed and that those committing it would become the Wests new friends?

NATO snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Libya. Refugees flood Europe. Terrorist attacks continue to spread geographically and in lethality. The Syrian civil war rages on. Iran lavishes its newfound wealth on its nuclear program and campaign of global terror.

Is it any wonder that citizens in Western countries are frustrated and angry with those in positions of authority?

Mexico's Profepa environmental protection agency imposed the 168-million-peso ($8.9-million) fine on Volkswagen Mexico for importing and selling 2016 model vehicles in the country that lacked an environmental certificate showing compliance with emissions standards.

""This was due to an administrative process that was unintentionally not carried out on time within Volkswagen Mexico,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday.

""Currently all 2016 model vehicles of the group's brands"" have the required permits in compliance with current environmental regulations, Volkswagen said, adding that all of its vehicles ""are safe from a technical standpoint and can be used without restriction.""

The NOM environmental compliance certificate establishes, among other things, the maximum allowable level of total hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and particles from new cars' exhaust pipes and also sets the maximum allowable level of noise and the measurement methodology.

Volkswagen Mexico was fined for importing and selling 45,494 Audi, Bentley, Porsche, Seat and Volkswagen vehicles in Mexico that lacked that environmental permit, Profepa said in a statement.

Profepa said the fine was separate from an investigation being conducted in Mexico over the Volkswagen defeat device scandal.

In September of last year, Environment Secretary Rafael Pacchiano said Mexico would review Volkswagen's emissions certificates for diesel engine vehicles the automaker had sold in Mexico since 2009 to verify if they were in compliance with national standards.

That probe came after Volkswagen acknowledged that the defeat devices had been installed on nearly 500,000 2.0-liter diesel-powered Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles sold in the United States since 2008.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused the automaker last September of using the devices to dupe regulators.

The software on those engines detected when emissions testing was taking place and activated the cars' emissions controls.

When those same vehicles were being driven under normal conditions, the controls were turned off and they spewed up to 40 times the United States' legally allowable amount of nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the formation of smog and acid rain.

The automaker said last September, after the scandal broke, that 11 million of its vehicles worldwide had been equipped with the defeat devices.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

For the last 4 months she has been in and out of the hospital, fighting one setback after another, accompanied by excruciating pain in her back, ribs and gallbladder; and ending with a fall when trying to walk, (without waking me to assist her) to the bathroom. She fractured her tailbone and had pain coming from everywhere.

A wonderful pain management specialist, Dr. Christine Lee has entered Noreen's life, and her pain has become manageable.

Spine doctor Dr. Sang Kim determined Noreen's tailbone fracture was not caused by her cancer. She was prescribed progesterone, and after 10 radiation treatments to her back, something started to work. She underwent a blood transfusion and painful Neupogen injections (which stimulate white blood cell growth), and suddenly her markers went down.

Miraculously, Noreen has bounced back.

Pain will remain a part of her life (but will be managed well). I got rid of the wheelchair, and bought her a neat walker -- and she is rounding-into her old self. This is proven by the fact that last night she cleaned the kitchen while I slept. And when Noreen cleans, look out!

Tonight I am taking this wonderful woman out to dinner. Wow!

I love this courageous wife of mine.

Summit Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ronda Churchill)

""Pacific Rim"" filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and ""Metal Gear Solid"" video game creator Hideo Kojima had big plans for their top-secret interactive collaboration.

""We had great ideas that I think would have done fantastic,"" del Toro said on stage Thursday at the Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's annual D.I.C.E. Summit.

The writer-director of such films as ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Crimson Peak"" reunited with Kojima for a talk at the 15th annual gathering of elite members of the video game industry. The appearance marked the pair's first public appearance together since their video game, ""Silent Hills,"" was canceled last year by publisher Konami.

The title was intended to be the next installment in the long-running ""Silent Hill"" horror franchise and feature ""The Walking Dead"" actor Norman Reedus. Del Toro and Kojima teased it last year with the release of a mysterious PlayStation 4 demo called ""P.T.""

""'P.T.' itself was meant to be sort of a decoy,"" del Toro said. ""We were thinking it would take (players) 10 days, two weeks to solve it. They solved it in three days.""

The pair  fans of each other's work  first met when del Toro was in Japan to promote ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."" They quickly became friends, and del Toro invited Kojima to his ""man cave,"" populated with the quirky filmmaker's games, toys and other geeky collectibles.

Kojima, who was affiliated with Konami since 1986, is being inducted this year into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. After finishing work on ""Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"" he is now working on a PS4 game with a newly formed studio, Kojima Productions.

""I feel extremely free right now,"" the Japanese game designer said through a translator. ""I'm trying to make a very big game with an extremely small team. I am doing exactly what I want to do.""

Despite the duo moving on to other projects, del Toro is hopeful that he'll again collaborate with Kojima.

""I'll do whatever the (expletive) he wants,"" the filmmaker said with a big grin, motioning to Kojima.","[]"

"258","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","The Most Common Questions Asked by Home Buyers -- Answered!","[]","Buying a home is thrilling, scary, sometimes weird, often epic, and never dull. You're ponying up a huge wad of cash for a place you'll inhabit hopefully for years to come. As such, you're bound to have a lot of questions throughout every step of the process. So to head you off at the pass, we asked real estate agents to spill the beans on most common questions buyers ask them -- and the answers, of course. You're welcome.

Q: What home can I afford?

That depends, of course -- on your income and other financial obligations; plug them into realtor.com's Home Affordability Calculator for a ballpark figure. And do it before you start shopping, says Alyssa Blevins of Pierce Murdock Group in Alexandria, VA. ""If you see houses you love outside your price range, it opens you up to disappointment,"" she says. Meet with a lender to get pre-approved for a home loan (added bonus: pre-approval makes you much more attractive to sellers).

Q: Can I buy a home and sell my current one at the same time?

Yes, you can -- but it's the real estate equivalent of walking a tightrope. ""This is one of the trickiest questions to answer,"" says Cedric Viquerat of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate in Bradenton, FL. On the one hand, if you buy a home before you sell the one you're in, you're overextended financially; if you sell before you buy, you might need to rent awhile before finding a new place. But there are ways to do both at once, and one option is to instate a ""sale contingency"" in your contract. This means you only agree to buy a home if you can sell the one you're in. The only downside is if your seller doesn't agree (which is possible if they want the timing set in stone).

Q: How many homes should I see before making an offer?

Up to you, sport! While home shoppers these days can look at hundreds of homes online, they only hoof it to check out 10 homes on average before they put in an offer. But keep in mind, ""This varies tremendously for each person,"" says Will Johnson, a Realtor in Hendersonville, TN, and founder of Sell and Stage. ""Some people find their home within hours of hunting. For others, it takes months."" If you want to streamline the process, it can help to really hone in on a particular neighborhood you're keen on; that said, if you feel limited by your options, it may be time to expand to surrounding areas.

Q: What do you think the seller will accept as a fair price?

As a rule of thumb, knocking 5% off the list price won't ruffle any feathers. If it's been sitting on the market for months, you can venture below that, but the bottom line is, ""You never know how low a seller will go, as they have different motivations for selling,"" says Marc Castillo of Coldwell Banker in Atlanta, GA. If the sellers are eager to move, you could luck out and score a deal.

Q: How do I know if the property is a good deal?

While there's no crystal ball on whether a certain home is a bargain and will appreciate, rest assured that with research, you can keep surprises to a minimum. The best way is to check out comps -- what similar properties are selling for in the area -- ""and whether those prices have been going up or down in the recent past,"" says Felise Eber, a Miami Beach real estate associate with Coldwell Banker.

Q: How quickly can I close?

""Typical escrow periods are 30 to 45 days,"" says Rina Camhi, a Houston, TX-based agent and brokerage owner of 10MinRealty. ""This gives you enough time to do the investigation on the property and get a loan completed."" And yes, this due diligence counts (see our next point).

Q: Should I get a home inspection?

While buyers often wonder if a home inspection is truly necessary, most Realtors unequivocally say yes, yes, and yes. ""A home inspector takes a weight off of your shoulders by looking into the condition of the roof, electricity, heating and air, plumbing,"" says Johnson. ""Ensuring these things work prevents you from paying to fix them in the future. If some things are not up to par, you can negotiate with the seller to get those fixed before you sign the paperwork.""

Q: When can I back out if I change my mind?

While buyers can always back out of a deal, doing so without good reason may forfeit their earnest money (the cash put down to secure the offer, typically around 1%-2% of the home's price). But there are some ways to walk with your earnest money in hand.

""Contingencies are great loopholes,"" says Bridges. ""For example, upon an unsatisfactory home inspection, the buyer can ask for their deposit back. Another loophole is 'subject to appraisal.'"" That means you can back out if the lender for your loan doesn't think the property is worth what you offered.

Home buyers aren't the only ones with questions; home sellers have plenty on their minds, too. Find out what they're wondering in a new article next week!","[]"

"260","foxnews","2016-02-21 00:00:00","After Cy Young season, Cubs' Jake Arrieta ready to get back on the mound","[]","Sometime around the end of last season or maybe afterward, it hit Jake Arrieta.

He finally grasped that he did not simply dominate down the stretch. He performed at a record level that catapulted him to the Cy Young Award while leading the Chicago Cubs to the NL Championship Series.

""I joked with my buddies about this a few times,"" Arrieta said Saturday. ""I didn't even really understand the magnitude of the second half that I had until the season was kind of over. I looked at the numbers and I was messing around with a few of my buddies, saying, 'I don't know if that second-half ERA will ever be broken.' You look at guys like Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, some of these guys that had incredible seasons a long, long time ago.""

Arrieta's season was as dominant as any and his second half reached historic proportions.

All he did last year was lead the majors in wins while going 22-6 and posting a 1.77 ERA. As impressive as those numbers are, they don't quite tell the complete story.

His ERA after the All-Star break was 0.75. The right-hander went 11-0 over his final 12 starts, and he finished with 236 strikeouts. Arrieta also tossed a no-hitter and beat Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw for the Cy Young.

All that from a guy who had never won more than 10 games.

Now, Arrieta is one of the most important figures as the Cubs try to bring home their first championship since 1908 after a breakthrough 97-win season.

To that end, manager Joe Maddon plans to bring him along slowly in spring training and monitor his innings after watching him throw a career-high 229 a year ago. That easily surpassed his previous high of 156 2-3 in 2014, and Arrieta and the Cubs believe the heavy workload ultimately wore him out when it mattered most.

Sure, he shut out Pittsburgh in the wild-card game. But after that?

Arrieta was far from dominant, combining for a 6.75 ERA in a sluggish victory over St. Louis in the division series and a loss to the New York Mets in the NLCS.

""He gets it now,"" Maddon said. ""Guys like him who had never been through it before, you pretty much feel like you're invincible, you can do anything. We've all been through that. He's had the experience of understanding what does it feel like to be in that position. And he knows it now first hand. My job should be somewhat easier in regards to harnessing him just a bit in regards to different moments.""

That means the Cubs might on occasion take him out an inning sooner than they would have last season. It also means Arrieta probably won't have as many complete games after tying for the major league lead with four.

After all, the Cubs believe they have a deep bullpen. And they want to preserve their ace.

Maddon said that would have been the plan even if Arrieta had not struggled in those final two starts. And Arrieta insisted he is fine with that even if it goes against his competitive nature.

A year or two ago, that might have bothered him. But not now.

""We were in the NLCS last year,"" Arrieta said. ""We expect to go one step farther this year. If we want to do that, there are certain sacrifices that have to be made. And I'm more than willing to make those sacrifices to be better for my team.""

He isn't worried about approaching last season's numbers because there is simply too much luck involved, whether it's a close pitch being called a strike or a batted ball being caught rather than falling for a hit.

He is focusing more on what he can control, such as improving his pickoff move and mixing up the amount of time he takes between pitches. And, of course, his conditioning.

Arrieta closely monitors his diet, with a high concentration of fruits and vegetables, lean chicken and seafood. And his workout regimen is something to behold.

There is a big emphasis on Pilates, with weightlifting also part of the routine, to remain flexible and durable. Teammates and coaches seek advice from him.

""He's just a specimen, definitely a pure athlete,"" pitcher Kyle Hendricks said. ""I think that's why he carried that workload so well last year. I think it sets him up that he's not gonna have any troubles coming off that year at all.""

What a year it was  for Arrieta and the Cubs. Now, they come into the season with all sorts of expectations.

""The pressure, the expectations, really don't play much of a role for me,"" Arrieta said. ""It doesn't add any increased anxiety or nervousness. ... I feel like I've put myself in position to attain good results.""

In a statement Monday, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it has approved research led by scientist Kathy Niakan to try to understand the genes that embryos need to develop successfully.

Niakan, of the Francis Crick Institute, plans to use gene editing to analyze the first week of an embryo's growth.



Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, said Niakan's research would ""enhance our understanding of (in vitro fertilization) success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development.""

The scientists will not be allowed to implant any embryos used in their research into women. The embryos, which would be donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment who do not need them, must also be destroyed after two weeks.

Last year, Chinese researchers made the first attempt at modifying genes in human embryos. Their laboratory experiment didn't work but raised the prospect of altering genes to repair the genes of future generations.

Scientists say such techniques could lead to treatments for inherited diseases like muscular dystrophy and HIV. Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to genetically modified human babies.

Around the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what kind of research on embryos that will change the genes of future generations, is allowed. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund this kind of research but private funding is allowed.



Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to a slippery slope.



""This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalization of (genetically modified) babies,"" said David King, of anti-gene manipulation group Human Genetics Alert, last month when the British fertility regulator held its meeting to decide on granting the gene editing license.

Rubio, who placed second in South Carolina based on complete but unofficial returns, argued that his policy specifics trump Trump's big talk. ""If you're running for president of the United States, you can't just tell people you're going to make America great again,"" Rubio said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Cruz, right behind Rubio in the South Carolina vote, stressed his conservative credentials and said he was the lone ""strong conservative in this race who can win. We see conservatives continuing to unite behind our campaign,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Trump, looking ever more in control of the race for the GOP nomination, opted against his trademark braggadocio in assessing the state of the race.

Asked on CBS if the race was his to lose, Trump said, ""I don't want to say it's mine. Certainly I'm leading, there's no question about that, but we've got a long way to go.""

The GOP candidates were fanning out Sunday to Nevada, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia and beyond as the race spreads out and speeds up after the kickoff trio of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Nevada's GOP caucuses are Tuesday, and then a dozen states vote in the March 1 Super Tuesday bonanza.

The Democrats next compete Saturday in South Carolina after Hillary Clinton blunted concerns about her viability with a clear victory over Bernie Sanders in Nevada, the first state to test the Democrats' appeal among a racially diverse group of voters.

Clinton celebrated her Nevada triumph but acknowledged she has work to do in persuading voters that she has their best interests at heart.

""I think there's an underlying question that maybe is really in the back of people's minds and that is, you know, is she in it for us or is she in it for herself?"" Clinton said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ''I think that is a question that people are trying to sort through.""

Sanders took a hard look at the where the delegate math takes him from here. He acknowledged that while he has made gains on Clinton, ""at the end of the day ... you need delegates."" He looked past South Carolina and ticked off Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Oklahoma as places where he hopes to do well.

Trump, now the clear leader in the delegate race, cemented his standing as his party's favorite. No Republican in modern times has won New Hampshire and South Carolina and then failed to win the nomination.

""It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious,"" Trump said of the rollicking presidential campaign. ""It's beautiful. When you win, it's beautiful.""

Trump's victory was vindication for political mavericks whose hunger for an outsider has defined this year's campaign. But those fortunes didn't extend to Sanders this weekend. After winning the second contest in New Hampshire, the democratic socialist came up in short in Nevada, where Clinton collected the majority of delegates and told gleeful supporters that ""this one is for you.""

For Republican Jeb Bush, it was the end of the line. With donors ready to bolt, the political scion dropped out of the race after failing to break into the top three.

A string of victories for Clinton and Trump in Super Tuesday contests would give them commanding leads in the delegate race, dampening prospects for their rivals to catch up. Already, Trump leads Republicans with 67 of the needed 1,237 delegates, with Cruz at 11 and Rubio at 10. Clinton has 503 to Sanders' 70, including party officials known as superdelegates who back the candidate of their choice.

The biggest question facing Republicans now is whether those seeking to spoil a Trump nomination have simply run out of time.

Rubio and Cruz argued that with roughly 70 percent of GOP voters consistently voting for someone other than Trump, they have an opening as the GOP field keeps shrinking.

Rubio called it the ""alternative-to-Donald-Trump vote,"" and predicted it would coalesce around him.

Cruz countered that he's the only Republican who's been able to beat Trump so far, referring to his victory in leadoff Iowa.

Sanders congratulated Clinton on her victory in Nevadas closely-contested caucuses, and said he looked forward to the primaries and caucuses ahead.

I am very proud of the campaign we ran,"" Sanders said. ""Five weeks ago we were 25 points behind and we ended up in a very close election. And we probably will leave Nevada with a solid share of the delegates.""

The balloting in Nevada coincides with the Republican primary Saturday in South Carolina, where front-runner Donald Trump was projected the night's winner.

In Nevada, Clinton was looking to rebound after losing big to Sanders in the party's New Hampshire primary, and only narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses.

The candidates spent their final hours before the caucuses furiously trying to drive up turnout among their supporters.

Significant spending by Sanders on paid media and staff helped his campaign make inroads into the Latino and African-American communities, which make up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate in the state.

It wasn't enough to edge out Clinton. But each candidate benefited from a different set of constituencies.

Entrance polls showed Clinton held the lead among the states influential union voters, with 56 percent going for Clinton and 43 percent going for Sanders.

But the breakdown was flipped among first-time caucus-goers, with 54 percent backing Sanders and 43 percent backing Clinton. Clinton also held the lead among women, but Sanders held a massive lead among caucus-goers under 45.

Clinton had until recent weeks held a double-digit polling lead in Nevada, but that narrowed considerably in the closing days of the race.

""The fact Bernie Sanders has shown the ability to compete anywhere on the map says as much about Democrats' dissatisfaction with Hillary Clinton and her weaknesses as a candidate as it does about the sharp left turn their party has taken,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a written statement.

This new species, the first ever found in the eastern United States, was probably 20 to 30 feet long as an adult and lived during the late Cretaceous Period, roughly 83 million years ago. It mostly walked on its hind legs, though it could come down on all four to graze on plants with teeth that are similar to modern day horses and cows. It had a scaly exterior and a large crest on its nose.

This is a really important animal in telling us how they came to be and how they spread all over the world, said Florida State University Professor of Biological Science Gregory Erickson, one of the authors of a paper detailing the dinosaur in the findings the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The researchers named the new dinosaur Eotrachodon orientalis, which means dawn rough tooth from the east. The name pays homage to Trachodon, which was the first duck-billed dinosaur named in 1856.

The skeletal remains - a complete skull, dozens of backbones, a partial hip bone and a few bones from the limbs - were originally found by a team of amateur fossil enthusiasts alongside a creek in Montgomery County, Alabama in marine sediment. That would suggest the dinosaur likely was washed out to sea by river or stream sediments after it died.

When the group realized they had potentially discovered something of scientific importance, they contacted McWane Science Center in Birmingham, which dispatched a team to the site to carefully remove the remains from the surrounding rock.

During the late Cretaceous Period, North America was divided in half by a 1,000 mile ocean that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. This body of water created two North American landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. Back then, Appalachia began roughly in Georgia and Alabama and stretched all the way north into Canada.

For roughly 100 million years, the dinosaurs were not able to cross this barrier, Jun Ebersole, director of collections at McWane Science Center, said. The discovery of Eotrachodonsuggests that duck-billed dinosaurs originated in Appalachia and dispersed to other parts of the world at some point after the seaway lowered, opening a land corridor to western North America.

The political dysfunction in Washington, DC has left many Americans feeling disillusioned, disenfranchised and  maybe most of all  angry that their elected leaders arent listening to them. Clearly, the country is yearning for strong leadership to get this great nation moving in the right direction again.

For Republicans, our party faces a critically important choice this Saturday too. In a crowded and competitive field, a very fine man stands out as the only proven conservative who has governed a major swing state and solved the kinds of big, difficult problems the country faces in Washington today. His name is Jeb, and here is why you should vote for him.

Leading Florida for eight years, Jeb held true to his conservative values while bringing Republicans and Democrats together around a series of reforms that made his state the national leader in job creation and small business creation. Hes the only candidate in the race who can say he has already cut the size of government, and on top of that he balanced eight budgets and provided $19 billion of tax cuts to Floridians.

Jeb is also passionate about reading and learning and recognized that, without a good education, a child cannot be expected to live a life of meaning and purpose. That is why he challenged the teachers union in Florida to pass sweeping  and conservative  education reforms that expanded school choice and provided parents and students with better learning opportunities. Today, Floridas high school graduation rate is nearly 50 percent higher than when Jeb passed his A+ reforms.

In the end, however, this nomination fight is not about the past. Rather, its about the future  your future. It is about your family, and your children, and who you want in the Oval Office that can actually deliver the economic growth, national security and real government reforms our country desperately needs.

The choice is clear.

Other candidates  who have no comparable record of accomplishment to which they can point  seem to measure strength by the loudness of their voices or the harshness of their tone. Jeb is even-tempered, serious and resolute  which history has repeatedly shown to be the true sign of executive strength.

The fact that Jeb has been endorsed by 30 retired admirals and generals and 12 Medal of Honor recipients speaks volumes about his readiness to serve as Commander-in-Chief. Jeb will be a president who restores our military strength and respects our veterans, and his economic plans will strengthen job growth and result in working families receiving a pay raise for the first time in a long time.

No one running for president has achieved more positive change for people in a bigger state than Jeb did. He was a transformational governor and I believe he would be a transformational president. I know that, if American people give Jeb their trust, he will work tirelessly to change the broken culture of Washington and to lift our great nation to new heights.

Barbara Bush is a former first lady of the United States, married to former President George H.W. Bush. Her son George W. Bush was the nation's 43rd president and younger son Jeb is a 2016 Republican candidate for president.","[]"

(AP Photo/Juan Karita)

An influence-peddling scandal involving a former lover and a deadly incident of political violence dogged President Evo Morales as Bolivians voted Sunday on whether he should be allowed to run for another term.

The voters were deciding whether to amend the constitution so that Morales, in office for a decade, can run for re-election in 2019. The current limit is two terms and the change would allow presidents to run for re-election twice.

Pre-election polls indicated voters were about evenly split  with some 15 percent undecided  on whether to give Bolivia's first indigenous president another shot at governing. Then the bombshell hit.

An opposition-aligned journalist revealed two weeks ago that an ex-lover of Morales in 2013 was named sales manager of a Chinese company, CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd, which has obtained nearly $500 million in mostly no-bid state contracts.

Morales denied any impropriety, and said he last saw the woman in 2007 when a child they conceived died under circumstances that neither has explained.

The case deepened doubts about the integrity of Morales' governing Movement Toward Socialism, which has been dogged by scandal.

Adding to Morales' woes were last week's asphyxiation deaths of six municipal officials in El Alto, the teeming city adjacent La Paz run since last year by an opposition mayor.

Pro-Morales forces are accused of setting the fire that provoked the deaths, sacking the building where the slain officials worked and torching documents that allegedly incriminate the previous mayor in payroll corruption.

Both developments threatened to eclipse Morales' achievements in cutting poverty, spreading Bolivia's natural resource wealth and empowering its indigenous majority during a decade in office.

Eusebio Condori, a 60-year-old retired schoolteacher, said he voted ""no"" because the scandal and the deaths ""confirm that this government doesn't have a plan for Bolivia, only for itself.""

A 31-year-old mother of three, Maria Espinoza, said she voted ""no"" because she believes in term limits. She echoed the complaint of others that too many jobs depend on political patronage.

""I hope for change in the country,"" she said.

Alejandro Perez, a 30-year-old independent lawyer, said he voted ""yes"" because ""we've got to ensure continuity.""

""Evo Morales is the only person who can fight the economic crisis,"" said Perez, adding that no one in the opposition is capable.

South America's left has recently been sullied by scandal but Morales had personally remained unscathed.

His ruling circles have been discredited, however, by the skimming of millions from the government-managed Fondo Indigena, which runs agricultural and public works in the countryside.

Morales presided over Bolivia's biggest economic boom while prices for raw materials soared just as he took office, constructing airports, highways and the pride of La Paz, an Austrian-built aerial tramway system, and putting a Chinese-built satellite into space. In 2014, he won re-election with 60 percent of the vote.

But that boom is over.

Bolivia's revenues from natural gas and minerals, making up three-fourths of its exports, were down 32 percent last year.

Economists say Morales leaned heavily on extractive industries to pay for populist programs and failed to diversify the economy.

Under Morales, average per capita income rose from $873 to $3,119 and a new indigenous middle class was born.

But judicial corruption has been endemic and press freedom suffered as major news outlets were purchased by people friendly with the government and critical media and environmentalists complained of harassment by the state.

We got this question from a viewer:

Dear Dr. Manny,

My 6-month-old daughter who is usually a great sleeper has been waking up several times a night crying and is just generally cranky all of a sudden. I think she is teething. What can I do to help soother her discomfort?

Thanks,

Tara

Do you have health questions? If you have health questions just email Dr. Manny: drmanny@foxnews.com

Well, Tara, you may be right. Most babies start teething between four and seven months. Signs can include:

- Excessive drooling

- Chewing on solid objects

- Irritability or crankiness

- Tender, swollen gums

- Night waking

- Ear pulling

Its important you keep a close eye on your baby because some of the signs of teething can actually be symptoms of illness.

But, if she is about to cut her first tooth, there are things you can do to help ease the pain:

- Offer teething toys or a clean, wet washcloth to provide counterpressure on the gums.

- Rub babys gums using a clean finger or moistened gauze.

- Try giving her cold water in a bottle or cold food in a mesh feeder is shes six months or older.

- Dry off excess drool that can cause skin irritation.

- If all else fails, you can try giving her acetaminophen, but only after youve talked to her doctor.

Avoid using any numbing agents which have been shown to put children under the age of 2 at risk for reduced oxygen in the blood and always talk to your childs doctor before trying any home remedies.","[]"

And he's a NASCAR fan, too.

Griffey, who last month was voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, was on hand for Sunday's Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway where he was serving as the honorary starter for the 58th running of the The Great American Race.

Before waving the green flag on the 40-car field, Griffey, who lives in nearby Orlando, revealed that he has a longstanding affinity for one of NASCAR's most famous families -- the Earnhardts.

""I've always been an Earnhardt family fan,"" said Griffey, who played 22 years in the major leagues where he was a 13-time all-star and excelled on both sides of the ball. ""I wore a black batting glove on Sunday when I was with the (Cincinnati) Reds and then Dale (Jr.) for his charity asked me to sign a couple things. Most drivers sign a tire and stuff. I was like, 'I don't want a tire. I want a hood,' so I got a hood from him that's prominently displayed at my house. My wife was like, 'Where we gonna put this?' I said, 'We can put in the ceiling or on the wall.' Having a tire the only thing I could do is put glass top on there.""

Griffey, also, has apparently gotten to know four-time Sprint Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who is making his debut this weekend as an analyst for the FOX NASCAR on-air team.

Griffey and Gordon, of course, share a unique connection: They both helped make the No. 24 famous in their respective sports. Daytona 500 pole winner Chase Elliott became the new driver of the iconic number, beginning with Daytona Speedweeks.

""I got a chance to play golf with a certain race car number, driver No. 24,"" Griffey said. ""I'm really superstitious about certain things. He's no longer racing, but I hear he's in the building so I'm going to definitely go visit him, but waving the green flag, 24 will be the first car coming by, which is pretty cool, too.""

Turns out Griffey is actually so superstitious that he's never stepped foot inside the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

""My thing was, the first time I go in, I want to be a Hall of Fame member. All of my friends were like, 'We're going there.' I was like, 'OK, I'll see ya'll later.' They're like, 'You're not going to go in? You've got a lot of stuff in there.' And I'm like, 'No, I'm not going to do that.'""

With his induction into the Hall now imminent, Griffey plans to finally venture inside.

""In a couple weeks I'm going to go and visit to make sure that I get the lay of the land,"" he said. ""I know where the ballpark is. I know where the hotel is. It's just the building that I missed. We even had two rainouts there and I never went in. ... I'm just really superstitious.""

But in that way, Griffey said he's not that different from some NASCAR drivers.

""Everybody who plays a sport has something that they do, and even you guys have it, too,"" he told a room full of reporters. ""I left to go a ballpark at 12 o'clock everyday if it was a night game. I'm really superstitious. I've gotten a little better as I've retired, but it's still the same.""","[]"

Reading and Shrewsbury, for now, are the two lone survivors from the lower divisions, and both could be rewarded with a profitable fixture with a visit from a Premier League club.

But intrigue still surrounds the Arsenal-Hull fixture, the only tie to go to replay after a grim 0-0 draw Saturday. Tentatively scheduled for March 8, the game is brutal for both teams. Arsenal have a packed schedule with a game Tuesday against Barcelona then league matches against Manchester United and Tottenham; while Hull, atop the Championship by a point and with a game in hand, also have four big games to play between now and then.

The marquee tie of the round looks to be at Goodison, where Joel Robles backstopped the Toffees to a big 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday. Chelsea swept aside Manchester City 5-1 in a game that saw Manuel Pellegrini field a team largely comprised of youth players. Both Everton and Chelsea are desperate for some silverware out of this season, and both are expected to make a serious run at the Cup.

West Ham, the big winners on the weekend with a sweeping 5-1 demolition of lower-tier Blackburn, also look to making a run at the Cup. While they are likely to face Manchester United in the next round, few fear Old Trafford these days and the Londoners are likely to think they can get a result.

He could be in Washington preparing for the next meeting of House Democrats or raising money for colleagues.

But instead he's here in Las Vegas, traveling from union halls to drab campaign phone bank centers to convince voters that Hillary Clinton should be the next president of the United States.

As he makes the rounds for Clinton, speaking to voters in both English and Spanish, he is also laying the groundwork for his own second act.

Hes one of the most prominent Latinos in Congress, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and running for a 13th term. But his opportunities to move up in the House leadership are limited unless someone retires or steps down.

I dont know what might happen, he said, but Im not going to be caught flat-footed.

That is at least one of the reasons he devoted 36 hours here last weekend to walk the streets of Nevada speaking to potential caucus-goers, and picking up the phone to make a pitch for Clinton.

In a state that is 28% Latino and critical to Clinton's closer-than-expected battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Becerra is a valuable stand-in for the former Secretary of State  an affable Spanish-speaking politician able to connect with voters as a big city congressman who was the first in his family to attend college.

And he knows as well as anyone that, if Team Clinton prevails in the election, there could be a reward for his grassroots efforts.

Becerra has quietly stumped for Clinton across five states since endorsing her in August. He has devoted six weekends, acting as a surrogate on local television and telling people in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina why they should vote for the woman hes known for nearly 25 years. (He doesnt mention that, when Clinton battled Barack Obama for the nomination eight years ago, he was on Obamas side.)

On the trail last weekend, in advance of this Saturdays caucuses, Becerra was leaning against a railing, holding an Iron Workers for Hillary sign as Clinton addressed cheering union members representing iron workers, bricklayers and teachers.

The setting was a union hall in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson. A folding wall has been opened to create more space as organizers tried to fit in more union members who had been waiting  some since dawn  in a line that wrapped the building.

Hill-Yes! one woman yelled. Others waved signs reading Estoy Contigo, or ""Im With You"" in Spanish.

U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) campaigns for Hillary Clinton in Nevada.

Becerra nodded when Clinton briefly thanked him onstage. Photographers and others trying to get a better view of the candidate pushed by, not recognizing him.

After the speech, Clinton lingered to shake hands and talk to the crowd.

Becerra rushed in the opposite direction to talk Clinton up to the local and national press in the back of the room. It's less glamorous than commanding the stage, but critical to her potential success.

Becerra has been in this position before.

His 2008 endorsement of Obama led to an offer to join that administration as U.S. trade representative. But Becerra turned that down, suggesting he was worried trade wouldn't be a major focus of the administration. (The Obama administration wasn't pleased the congressman took weeks to make up his mind.)

Last year, he contemplated running for retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer's seat, but decided to stay in the House despite an uncertain path to power there.

He has less than a year left in his term as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, but if he hopes to be the first Latino House leader, he'll have to wait. Democratic matriarch Nancy Pelosi, 75, has given no indication about when she will retire, and her No. 2, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, 76, is expected to move into that job once she does.

That leaves Becerra, 58, with some choices. In 2018, if Sen. Dianne Feinstein retires, he could pursue the seat she has held for 23 years. Or ask to be placed on the powerful House Budget Committee. Or perhaps there is a role for him should Clinton become the party nominee.

He wants to do more in federal politics, but isnt focused on a particular job, he said. He's heard speculation he could be a vice presidential pick, but declines to speculate himself.

Shame on me if I dont try to do more with what I have. It would be ... a terrible thing to waste this opportunity to try to make a difference, he said. ""Im closer to my final year doing this work than I am to my first year. I want to make a difference, and there are so many ways.""

Becerra hosts fundraisers and dinners with colleagues and supporters during the Washington work week and campaigns for local candidates around stumping for Clinton. On Sunday, he traveled to Houston to campaign for Democratic Rep. Gene Green.

As he walked out the front door of Clinton's rally at Painter's Hall, a dozen Service Employees International Union members, who took a bus from Los Angeles at 2:30 a.m. to make it in time, mob Becerra, squeezing him into hugs. They block the exit, speaking rapidly in Spanish and prompting the congressman into several group photo configurations. The rally wasnt originally on his schedule, and a staffer has to repeatedly pull Becerra away so he can run to the car and make the next of his seven events.

It was a whirlwind trip to Vegas, with Becerra talking to Latino and other community groups, knocking on doors and reminding volunteers why they are working so hard.

[audio:http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/ak.podcast.foxnewsradio.com/news/housecallforhealth/HOUSECALLFORHEALTH_02-16-2016-ad.mp3]

Scientists have always been perplexed by the variability and origin of a persons tickle response. While some start giggling at the mere sight of wriggly fingers, others can sustain a feather caressing the toes without even cracking a smile.

One Neuroscientist explained to the Wall Street Journal whether the childlike response is learned or innate, and why it is almost impossible to tickle oneself.

While some argue that being ticklish is a defensive reflex against attack, Dr. David Linden explained in the report that he isnt sold.

While some ticklish parts of the body may be vulnerable in battle, others like toes wouldnt result in a mortal wound if struck. Linden compared being ticklish to having an itch, which experts believe evolved as a protective measure against infestation by insects or worms.

Linden told the Journal that it could be a clue that the tickle is a response to some sort of reflex gone awry.

He further concluded that there are no contextual or social reasons why most people are less ticklish as they get older, and that it is both learned and innate.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

New York (33-19-6) has put together a 6-1-1 stretch, and that includes going 3-0-1 with McDonagh sidelined by a concussion.

The Rangers will be without him again after he took an elbow to the jaw from Toronto's Leo Komarov in the first period of Thursday's 4-2 victory. McDonagh left as a precaution, and the scare of another concussion was quelled after he passed two league tests.

McDonagh, though, won't play Sunday due to jaw and neck ailments, and Komarov was suspended three games by the NHL.

""He seems to be doing OK, and we're all thankful for that,"" defenseman Marc Staal told the team's official website. ""That was a dirty hit, the kind of hit that we're trying to get out of the game, and I'm just happy that Mac is going to be OK.""

Rick Nash's injury is a different matter. He'll miss a 12th straight game with a bone bruise in his left leg.

Derick Brassard and Mats Zuccarello are keying the Rangers offensively. Brassard has seven goals and seven assists in 10 games, while Zuccarello has 12 points over that span.

They accounted for three goals and two assists against the Leafs and Antti Raanta made 35 saves while starting for Henrik Lundqvist, who should be back for this one.

Lundqvist has been in net for New York's four straight home wins against Detroit, compiling a 0.98 goals-against average and two shutouts. It's the Rangers' longest home winning streak in the series since taking nine straight from 1982-87.

New York is 21-6-3 at MSG and the Red Wings have lost five straight on the road, their longest since a seven-game skid in March 2012.

Detroit is concluding a four-game road trip after falling 3-2 in a shootout at Ottawa on Saturday.

""I told the guys that we could play great and not win, that's the reality sometimes, and I'm not saying we played great, but certainly a lot better and we've got to do the same thing (Sunday),"" coach Jeff Blashill said.

Dylan Larkin's expected return should help. The center sat out one game with an illness but Blashill anticipates using him Sunday. Larkin leads the Red Wings with 19 goals, three fewer than Chicago's Artemi Panarin for the NHL rookie lead.

""I think Larkin could have played (Saturday), but it would have been about 80 percent and I'm not a big believer in playing guys like that when you have 100 percent guys there,"" Blashill said.

It seems unlikely that Petr Mrazek will face the Rangers for the first time after he made 25 saves and turned aside two of three shootout attempts Saturday. Mrazek hasn't started on back-to-back days this season, and allowed seven goals on 18 shots on the two occasions he did so last season.

Jimmy Howard is 4-2-1 with a 1.84 GAA in seven career games against New York, but his stopping 66 of 69 shots last season wasn't enough opposite Lundqvist's shutouts.","[]"

The Obama administration told a magistrate judge Friday it would be willing to allow Apple to retain possession of and later destroy specialized software it was ordered to create to help federal authorities hack into the encrypted iPhone belong to Syed Rizwan Farook.

""Apple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders,"" the Justice Department told Judge Sheri Pym. ""No one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.""

On Tuesday, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the FBI hack into the phone used by Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December.

Although the judge instructed Apple to create the software for the FBI, she said it could be loaded onto the phone at an Apple facility. The Justice Department made explicit Friday that Apple could retain custody of the software at all times.

That's a good ""compromise position"" because ""they're giving all the power to Apple,"" Jason Healey, a former director on cyber policy at the White House, told the Associated Press.

""They're telling Apple, 'You hold the software, we're not asking you to put a backdoor in the encryption, we just want to be able to brute force this thing,'"" Healey said. ""If the precedent is this, that they deliver the phone to Apple and Apple does it, I think that's a pretty good precedent that can't be done en masse on the next thousand iPhones.""

Authorities want Apple to bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to guess the passcode. Apple has helped the government before in this and previous cases, but this time Apple CEO Tim Cook said no and Apple is appealing the order.

The Justice Department filed a motion earlier Friday to compel Apple to comply with the court order.

""Apple has attempted to design and market its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data which has been found by this Court to be warranted for an important investigation. Despite its efforts, Apple nonetheless retains the technical ability to comply with the order, and so should be required to obey it,"" the motion states.

While the judge on the case says the government is only asking for help unlocking one, single iPhone, Apple says the case is much bigger than that and sets a dangerous precedent. Cook says the company doesn't have a system to bypass the self-destruct one.

""Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks  from restaurants and banks to stores and homes,"" Cook said.

The company has an additional three days to file its opposition to Tuesday's court order which is now due on Feb. 26, a law enforcement official tells Fox News.

Research published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed that concentrating on a visual task (say, scrolling through your Instagram feed) may render you temporarily deaf to normal-volume sounds (like your friends story about ... what was she talking about again?)

RELATED: Heres What Happens to Your Eyes When You Look at Multiple Screens

For the small study, researchers from the University College London analyzed the real-time brain activity of 13 volunteers as they completed visual tasks while sounds played in the background. As the tasks got harder, the brains response to sound was reduced.

The brain scans showed that people were not only ignoring or filtering out the sounds, they were not actually hearing them in the first place,  study co-author Maria Chait, PhD, explained in a press release. These findings suggest that our vision and our hearing share limited resources in the brain, which is essentially forced to choose between processing info from our eyes or our ears.

The stick brandished by sea lion Milo was made by aquarium volunteer Hugh Ryono.

An avid photographer and videographer, Ryono used an old aquarium target pole and mounted a GoPro camera on the end where the float is.

I had Milo try out the rig during an early morning training session. After checking out the feel of the selfie stick Milo proceeded to take the camera on a quick but exciting circuit of the front pool of the exhibit.

"291","foxnews","2016-02-17 00:00:00","Keeping Soldiers and Their Pets Together","[]","One week before Kathleen and Drew Barton were deployed to Afghanistan in 2014, the Mays Landing, New Jersey, couple were still searching frantically for a temporary home for their two large dogs. Their original pet care plans had fallen through and they were desperate for a new solution.

All their family and friends had their own pets to take care of, and putting the dogs in a kennel was far too expensive.

Thankfully, I found PACT, or People, Animals, Companions, Together, said Kathleen Barton. I was blown away at the love and compassion they had for my dogs.

A nonprofit that helps military personnel find foster homes for their animals while they serve overseas, PACT was created by retired lawyer Buzz Miller. In less than 24 hours Miller found a temporary loving home for the Bartons two dogs, Sasha and Vada.

""They are risking their lives,"" Miller said about American military servicemen and women. ""Now, they have one less thing to worry about. And they get regular email updates about their dogs from the dogs foster parents.""

Miller founded PACT in 2010 out of his Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, home. He and his wife have been rescuing cats and dogs for years. They both volunteer at a local rescue. ""I remember seeing these big burly guys, about to be deployed, sitting on the floors of shelters crying their eyes out because they had to leave and had no alternatives for their pets. Most of these shelters were kill shelters.""

PACT started out locally and now helps military personnel all over the country.

Petra Torri was determined to find a temporary loving home for her mini Cocker Spaniel, Coco, and her Jack Russell Terrier, Bella. The Florida native has lived with Coco for 6 years and Bella for 7. She found PACT online.

""I was going to train at the Office of Military Intelligence and couldnt bring my dogs with me,"" she explained. ""My boyfriend is also in the Army, and he could be deployed during that time. My friends and family either have dogs or are serving in the military and cant foster. And pet sitters charge a lot for the seven- or eight-month period I would be training. It was too expensive.""

""Buzz (Miller) asked if I would fly my dogs up to Pennsylvania,"" said Torri. ""Within a day he put me in touch with Lorrie and Michael Manacchio, who agreed to foster my dogs.""

The Manacchios found out about PACT from a news segment on TV, and wanted to foster. They have two large dogs, Pluto, a 6-year-old Golden Retriever, and Gracie, a 10-year-old Chow mix.

""I was a bit concerned about leaving my small dogs in the company of a family with two large dogs,"" said Torri. ""Buzz assured me he checks out the homes of every foster family, and would never put a dog in a dangerous situation. In fact, they dont work with aggressive dogs.""

Torri also liked the fact that Michael Manacchio is a veteran. ""I spoke to Michael, and since he served in the military, he understood the stress I was feeling about leaving my dogs behind,"" she said. ""He assured me that he and his wife, Lorrie, would take good care of Coco and Gracie.""

The Manacchios took the day off from work when Torri, Coco, and Gracie arrived in Pennsylvania. ""I wanted to be here to meet Petra, Coco, and Gracie,"" said Lorrie Manacchio, who works for a pharmaceutical company, as does her husband. ""Buzz was concerned Michael and I work full time. He wanted to make sure someone would be here to watch and take care of the dogs while we were at work.""

Lorrie Manacchio's 83-year-old father, also a veteran, lives nearby and comes up every day for breakfast and lunch to walk the dogs and spend time with them. ""He has a standard Poodle, and when he retired from teaching, he became a dog trainer,"" said his daughter.

Torri could tell that all of the dogs got along well from the photos and e-mails the Manacchios sent her. In some of the photos, the dogs were taking turns sitting on Lorries lap lounging on an inner tube while floating in the Manacchios pool. Other photos showed the dogs playing with toys and balls.

""We now feel like our family has expanded, thanks to PACT,"" said Lorrie Manacchio.

PACT doesnt charge for its services. However, the group asks pet owners to provide enough money for veterinary care. Often the host family pays for pet food, and all pets in the program must be spayed or neutered.

Buzz Miller doesnt take kindly to people who give up their cats, dogs, birds, or other animals because of a move, a divorce, or tiring of caring for their pets. ""Adopting a pet is a commitment,"" he explained. ""You just cant toss aside a family member. People in the military often have no other choice.""

Miller also spends time looking for funds to help defray the operating costs for his small staff. PACT has received grants from Petco, Banfield, and the Dreyfus Foundation.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that pioneers tech for the US military, created the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program. Oregon-based company Leidos is working with the agency to develop the groundbreaking ship.

On Tuesday DARPA tweeted a picture of ACTUV being prepared for sea trials in the spring.

From concept: https://t.co/A2buvNq9DP to prototype -- this is ACTUV today, being prepped for sea trials this spring. pic.twitter.com/CsNQYmVl6S  DARPA (@DARPA) February 16, 2016

Without a human crew, this drone vessel will be able to execute important missions independently like tracking and trailing an enemy sub over thousands of miles  not just for a day or two, or even a few weeks  this drone could hunt the enemy for months.

Related: Drone swarms join the Navy

The ACTUV enemy submarine hunter is expected to be about 130 feet long. DARPA has announced that it will be revealed for the first time on April 7 when it will also be christened in Portland, Oregon.

In addition to hunting enemy subs, ACTUV will be capable of a wide range of missions, such as reconnaissance and counter-mine deployments. It could also be useful to resupply troops.

Whats the threat?

The rise of tough-to-detect and track diesel electric submarines poses a significant challenge to the U.S. Navy. ACTUV is designed to excel at tracking these ultra-quiet subs.

Diesel-electric submarines come at a relatively cheap price point of about $250 million, while giving their owners the advantage of stealthy movements beneath the surface due to their virtually silent engines.

How quiet is quiet? Reports suggest that some of these subs can be 15 decibels more quiet than a humpback whale.

Iran claims to have fleets of these sneaky subs.

How ACTUV will be a game changer

Enter ACTUV, which could roam the oceans for thousands and thousands of miles executing missions.

For next level tracking, the vessel will be armed with state-of-the art sensors allowing it to detect the quietest of enemy subs. The idea is that it will be nearly impossible for a hostile sub to slip the ACTUV when the unmanned vessel is on its tail.

Despite being smaller than traditional subs, the ACTUV will be able to achieve speeds that exceed diesel electric propulsion submarines - and for a fraction of the cost.

ACTUV will have logic that allows it to not just identify other vessels, but also predict how they will behave. The sub hunter will be so smart that it should be able to interact, counter and outmaneuver manned enemy vessels.

It will be able to run operations as part of a team with other unmanned vessels operating beneath the water and on the surface. The sub hunter could also work in cooperation with manned vessels.

And get this  ACTUV is designed to figure out and comply with maritime laws, such as regulations to prevent collisions.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

When ACTUV enters service, it will give the U.S. military a range of advantages. Rather than send out a destroyer or a nuclear sub, ACTUV could be deployed, freeing up those assets and keeping costs down.

ACTUV will offer lots of versatility, such as launching from and returning to a pier  rather than having to deploy from a ship like other UUVs (Unmanned Underwater Vehicles). ACTUV will also give the Navy a vessel with far better endurance. It will also be able to carry far more weight than lots of the drone surface vessels launched from ships.

Whats Next?

After the big reveal in April, ACTUV will continue to be tested and refined.

"293","foxnews","2016-02-20 00:00:00","5 smart home gadgets to create your home of the future","[]","Any homeowner knows that a lot of free time goes into taking care of your house. But what if your house could take care of you? That's the dream of the ""smart home""  and while there's no true sci-fi intelligent home that can do everything you need, we're getting closer.

Every day, 5.5 million smart devices are being connected in homes around the world, according to research firm Gartner. It further estimates there will be 6.4 billion of these ""Internet of Things"" devices by the end of the year, and 20.8 billion by 2020. If you want to get in on the ground floor, here are some gadgets you can buy today.

1. Tech to help you sleep better

There's been an explosion of gadgets that are designed to monitor and help you improve your sleep. The market for these gadgets is headed for more than $125 million in 2017, according to media reports.

Sense ($129) is a little orb that sits in your room, monitors noise, light, temperature, humidity and air particles and can wake you up at the ideal part of your sleep cycle. A tiny clip attached to your pillow tracks your movements. In the morning, it can tell you through an Apple app how much sleep you really got, and if something in your environment is disturbing your rest.

Some similar monitors include Beddit ($149), which also tracks your heart rate and breathing, and SleepRate ($100), which has an app full of useful information plus a wearable heart rate sensor. Withings Aura ($189.95) not only monitors your sleep, but it cycles through light and sound programs to try to improve it. Learn about other sleep trackers, including smartphone apps and smart mattresses.

These products mostly stand alone, but an upcoming sensor from Samsung called SleepSense will link up with Samsung's SmartThings Hub. When SleepSense detects that you're asleep, it will turn off the lights and TV and crank up the air conditioning. When you wake up, it'll turn on the coffee maker.

Note: Some fitness trackers that you wear around your wrist or clip onto your clothes monitor how well you sleep. Before you buy one, check out the exclusive Komando Fitness Tracker Comparison Chart.

2. A bright idea

How many times have you come home later than expected? It's dark outside and, of course, you didn't leave the lights on. You struggle to get the key in the door and, once you open it, you have to feel around the wall for the light switch. Then, room by dark room, you repeat those steps.

Wouldn't it be easier to tap an app on your phone while you're still in your car and turn on all the lights?

Lightbulb makers sell bulbs that you can link to the rest of your smart house. For example, with Philips' Hue LED lights and Philips Hue Bridge smart home device ($60; Amazon affiliate link), you can remotely turn on or off dozens of lightbulbs in and around your house.

These lights are also dimmable, so you can have softer lighting at night, or they can wake you up gently by turning on slowly in the morning. You can even sync your lightbulbs to your streaming music or movies. For example, you can program your Philips lightbulbs to dim automatically for optimal viewing when you turn on Netflix.

Bonus: ""Hey, Siri. Turn on the lights."" You can connect your Philips Hue lightbulbs to Apple's IoT hub, the Apple HomeKit. With it, you can use Apple's voice-activated assistant, Siri, to turn your lights on and off with voice commands.

3. A smart lock for your smart home

If you have a connected car, you may already be remotely turning it on or unlocking your doors without even touching your key ring. Cars are increasingly equipped with Internet-connected technology, so you can do things like unlock the doors when you've got an armful of groceries.

The same concept is at work in IoT homes. For instance, you can remotely lock and unlock your doors. Smart locks, like Kwikset's Kevo ($160; Amazon link) are Bluetooth-connected, too.

With Kevo and its smartphone app, you can program your home locks so only your family members can unlock the doors. You can set the times of day when they can unlock the doors, and you can give your house guests temporary access to your home. No keys required.

Once your family, guests and you have downloaded the Kevo app to your smartphones, you don't even need to take it out of your pocket or purse to unlock your doors. Just touch the lock with your finger, and it'll unlock.

4. Keeping things fresh

If you roll your eyes at the idea of smart appliances like a smart refrigerator, that's understandable. Why would you need a fridge that connects to the Internet? Actually, there are a few good reasons.

LG, for example, has SmartDiagnosis. If your LG smart appliance is on the fritz, it will connect you with LG's customer service department by phone, or with a smartphone app. The repair techs can tell you what's wrong and help you get it fixed fast.

Then there's food tracking. You can get alerts you when you need to restock an item or when an item is about to expire. Samsung's upcoming Family Hub refrigerator even has cameras inside, so you can check what's on its shelves while you're out grocery shopping.

5. A house that cleans itself

If you've ever been vacuuming and wished you had Rosie from the Jetsons around to help out, you can stop wishing. Roomba made its name with robotic vacuums that keep your house clean without you lifting a finger. But its latest model is the smartest yet.

The Roomba 980 ($899) has a Wi-Fi connection that lets you control it with a smartphone app no matter where you are. You can remotely tell Roomba to start vacuuming, and on its dashboard you can see what its been doing while you were out.

Plus, the 980 fixes one of Roomba's most frustrating faults. If you've ever used a Roomba, or another robotic vacuum, you can watch it clean and clean one section of your house and continually miss a spot. That's frustrating, but now it's been fixed: Using its cameras and sensors, Roomba creates a map of the room it's cleaning so it knows if it hasn't covered everything.

Bonus: Prepare for the future

One of the biggest hurdles to a true smart home is that most gadgets stand alone or work only with gadgets from the same company. That's why smart home hubs are going to be important.

Instead of tapping an app to unlock your door, then another app to put on your lights and yet another app to turn off your home security system, you just do all that from a single spot. There are plenty of companies pushing their own hubs.

But be sure to do your research on what gadgets will connect before you commit to one. Apple's HomeKit, for example, works with non-Apple gadgets, but only if they're HomeKit compatible. Some gadgets you buy might not be. Companies like Cassia and HomeGenie are creating third-party hubs and software that try to work with everything, but they, too, may not be fully compatible.

Whatever you choose, just keep in mind that it's still the early days of the smart gadget revolution. So enjoy what they can do, but don't be too surprised if everything changes in a year or two.

What was once the signature style of poor artists living on the cheap has become a favored form of expression of the wealthy eager to live the artisanal lifestyle.

""The original Bohemians generally did not have a ton of money, so they made do with what they had. And because they were creative and artistic, what they had was a love of art itself and beautiful aesthetics. They also had knack for creating a beautiful space with very little money,"" says Tracy Kay Griffin, the lead designer at Express Homebuyers in Springfield, VA.

Not everyone has ""bohemian blood,"" Griffin says. ""It's either in you and it flows naturally, or it doesn't.""

If you don't feel a natural flow, your boho dreams could become a big boh-no. If you lack the eye but love the look, try house hunting with boho in mind, looking for rich, layered fabrics, mismatched decor, and a variety of patterns.

Granted, sellers don't usually let you keep the decorations -- but when they fit the house so perfectly, it never hurts to ask!

Here are six bohemian-inspired homes, perfect for dreamers.

-- -- --

102 Butterwood Aly, Alys Beach, FL

Price: $4,750,000

The listing says...: ""Beach Bohemian Chic comes to Alys Beach.""

Our take: This six-bedroom waterside estate is undeniably sexy -- but less bohemian and more rustic coastal chic. Reclaimed ceiling beams, blue-and-white color scheme, and Spanish-style decor create a decadent, Mediterranean-meets-Caribbean coastal palace. Sure, there are metals and bold patterns, but just because a space is luxurious (and that enormous marble master bathroom certainly is) doesn't mean it's boho. It's just nice.

-- -- --

28843 Selfridge Dr, Malibu, CA

Price: $5,750,000

The listing says...: ""Bohemian elegance on Point Dume.""

Our take: What city knows bohemia best -- both past and present -- than Malibu? Peek inside this 4,500-square-foot ocean view escape, located right off the Pacific Coast Highway, and you'll find plenty of rustic appeal and boho inspiration.

""The bohemian decorating scheme is all about the eclectic clash of patterns and colors,"" says Sacha Nizami, an interior designer in Toronto. ""Layering is the single most important element in successful bohemian design.""

Here, layering goes to a near-extreme, with a lounge covered in vintage rugs and topped by eclectic seating of every variety -- swings, tepees, and rockers. Yes, the rest of the house might be a wee too modern for classic bohemian tastes, but its careful design whets the appetite.

-- -- --

1299 Canyon Rd, Santa Fe, NM

Price: $2,971,000

The listing says...: ""The home, once a renowned bohemian enclave, is now a masterfully remodeled, timeless residence, with classic details, modern ease, and intimate luxury.""

Our take: You can't say a home that was literally once a ""renowned bohemian enclave"" isn't bohemian, can you? There are plenty of New Mexico-inspired touches in this all-white wonderland, like the adobe walls and terra-cotta floors, but there are enough lush foliage and artistic moments to make La Bohme feel right at home. Gather around the stone moss fireplace to practice still life, or soak up the inspiration in the master bath's claw-foot tub.

-- -- --

4926 Llano Dr, Woodland Hills, CA

Price: $899,000

The listing says...: ""This Bohemian-Spanish, Moroccan inspired Woodland Hills home features expansive views of the Valley.""

Our take: Here's a pick for the not-quite-millionaires among us -- and it's the one we think Toulouse would find most appealing. Richly colored rugs cover the floor, and stark white walls pair with bold teal doorways and bold fabrics. The library is a luxurious heaven, with blue built-ins and lush daybeds, and the kitchen's cacophony of color and quirky tile work is a boho-lover's dream. Sure, some rooms still need an artist's eye, but we're certain you'll find inspiration.

-- -- --

130 Trescott Rd, Hanover, NH

Price: $649,000

The listing says...: ""Perched up on a secluded corner, this antique colonial and barn are a bohemian retreat and a departure from the everyday.""

Our take: This gorgeous barn needs a lot of work if boho decor is your end goal -- but if you're looking for a place to live the truly bohemian lifestyle, it might be perfect. For $649,000, you'll find a 1801 post-and-beam barn and 4.5 acres of ""mini-farm,"" including a small garden and plenty of wildflowers. Interiors are definitely rustic in nature, but with some inspiration, a few cans of paint, and swaths of vivid fabrics for layering, you might just mistake your surroundings for the French countryside in the mid-19th century ... until it snows, that is.

-- -- --

560 Broadway St, Longboat Key, FL

Price: $579,000

The listing says...: ""This delightful Key West style cottage is infused with a bohemian beach feel.""

Our take: Boho style is ""very casual, with layers and layers of mixed patterns artistically displayed throughout a home in rugs, pillows, fabrics, and art,"" says Griffin. ""That combination tends to be the essence of the bohemian style today."" This three-bedroom cottage is the closest to embodying the true bohemian spirit. From a kitchen layered in red, green, copper, and vintage art to the delicious master bedroom with bold colors and textures aplenty, every square foot of this gorgeous home screams bohemian.

Relatives identified the father as 24-year-old Demetrius Johnson. Fire officials said he carried his badly burned 8-year-old daughter from the two-family home in Buffalo shortly after 4 a.m. and died after returning to the lower apartment where his 1- and 3-year-old sons and their mother also lived.

A man on the second floor also died.

""He got me and the little baby out,"" the children's mother, Tempest Thomas, told WGRZ-TV outside of the Buffalo hospital where her children were taken. ""My daughter and son were trapped in there. I threw my daughter in the hallway and told him to get her out of there. He went back in trying to look for his 3-year-old son and never made it back out.... He died rescuing his son.""

A firefighter found the 3-year-old near where the father died and carried the child out, Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield said at a news conference.

Eight-year-old Treasure Brighon would be flown to Shriners Hospitals for Children in Cincinnati to be treated for burns, said a spokesman at Women & Children's Hospital in Buffalo, where 3-year-old, Demetrius Johnson was hospitalized with smoke inhalation.

Thomas and 1-year-old Demaris Johnson were not injured.

As of Friday afternoon, authorities had not released the name of the 49-year-old who died in the upstairs apartment.

The cause of the fire was under investigation.

In the television interview, Thomas cried as she held up her hand and the engagement ring she said Johnson had given her on Valentine's Day.

""I never got the chance to marry him,"" she said.","[]"

The Neanderthals were once the closest relatives of modern humans. Scientists recently discovered that Neanderthals and modern humans once interbred; nowadays, about 1.5 to 2.1 percent of DNA in people outside Africa is Neanderthal in origin.

""This raises several fascinating questions like, 'What effect does the Neanderthal DNA that remains in modern humans have on our biology?'"" said study senior author John Capra, an evolutionary geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. [See Photos of Our Closest Human Ancestor]

Now, for the first time, researchers have directly compared Neanderthal DNA with the clinical records of a significant portion of adults of European ancestry. The scientists discovered that this archaic genetic legacy has had a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology, they said.

""Neanderthal DNA influences a broad range of traits relevant to disease risk in modern humans,"" Capra told Live Science.

The researchers first identified about 135,000 Neanderthal genetic variations found in modern humans. Next, the scientists analyzed a database of more than 28,000 adults of European ancestry from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a consortium of nine hospitals across the United States. This data linked patient genetic data with versions of those individuals' electronic health records that were stripped of identifying details such as names and addresses.

The data helped the researchers determine if each person had ever been treated for medical conditions such as heart disease, arthritis and depression. It also helped the scientists determine what Neanderthal genetic variants each person carried.

Ultimately, the researchers found that Neanderthal genetic variants were significantly linked to increased risk of 12 traits, including heart attack and artery thickening.

Surprisingly, the investigators also found a Neanderthal genetic variant that significantly increased the modern human risk for nicotine addiction, the researchers said. However, this does not mean that Neanderthals smoked tobacco, Capra said.

""Tobacco was found solely in the Western Hemisphere until Europeans brought it back from expeditions to the Americas,"" Capra said. The Neanderthal DNA that boosts the risk of nicotine addiction may have had a completely different and potentially beneficial effect ""that exhibited itself 50,000 years ago,"" Capra said.

Some of the scientists' discoveries confirm previous ideas. For example, earlier research suggested that Neanderthal DNA influenced skin cells known as keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and germs. The new findings suggest that Neanderthal genetic variants increase the risk of developing sun-triggered skin lesions known as keratoses, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes.

""When we started this study, we expected that if we found anything at all, we would find an influence of Neanderthal DNA on bodily systems that are involved in interactions with the environment,"" Capra said. ""We hypothesized this because Neanderthals had been living in Central Asia and Europe for hundreds of thousands of years before our recent ancestors ever reached these areas  and thus had likely adapted to the distinct environmental aspects of these regions, compared to Africa, in terms of climate, plants and animals, and pathogens.""

Capra and his colleagues also found that a number of Neanderthal genetic variants influenced the risk for depression, with some variants increasing the risk and others reducing it.

""The brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,"" study lead author Corinne Simonti, a graduate student of human genetics at Vanderbilt University, said in a statement.""

The researchers suggest that some Neanderthal genetic variants might have provided benefits in modern human populations as they first moved out of Africa thousands of years ago. However, those variants may have later become detrimental in modern, Western environments, the scientists said. One example is Neanderthal DNA that increases blood clotting; while this can help seal wounds and prevent germs from entering the body, it can also increase the risk for stroke, miscarriage and other problems, Capra said.

The researchers suggest that Neanderthal DNA may not have contributed to differences in skin colors between modern humans, unlike what previous research has suggested. Instead, differences in modern human skin color probably developed very recently, Capra said. ""Neanderthals may also have had a range of skin colors,"" Capra added.

Future research can compare Neanderthal DNA with data gleaned from other sources of medical information, such as lab tests, doctors' notes and medical images, the researchers said. ""There is still much to learn about the effects of interbreeding on different populations in recent human history,"" Capra said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Feb. 11 in the journal Science.

Almost every top official in the South Texas town was arrested Thursday under a federal indictment accusing them of taking bribes from contractors and sending city workers to help an illegal gambling operator nicknamed ""Mr. T."" The town was once billed as the ""Spinach Capital of the World."" (Bob Owen/The San Antonio Express-News via AP) RUMBO DE SAN ANTONIO OUT; NO SALES; MANDATORY CREDIT

After weeks of turmoil and the arrests of all but one top city official, residents of Crystal City have a new problem: undrinkable water.

Black water came out of the pipes in homes in the tiny Texas city, where a sweeping bribery and conspiracy indictment has ensnared the recently resigned mayor and most other city leaders. Volunteers handed out donated bottles of water on Friday, as state environmental officials test the water for bacteria.

Joel Barajas  the only City Council member not facing criminal charges  told the San Antonio Express-News that he was grateful to residents elsewhere in the region who donated water. The city blamed the water problem on dirt and mud that had built up in a water tank that was flushed, according to the newspaper.

""There are caring people in Southwest Texas,"" said Barajas, who has been thrust into being the point person for all of the city's departments.

And to add even more to the town's woes, the Texas Education Agency said Friday that the local school district could lose its accreditation after failing to meet state standards for the third straight year.

A federal indictment released earlier this month charged the city manager, the mayor, the mayor pro tempore, a city councilman and a former councilman with taking bribes from contractors and sending city workers to help an illegal gambling operator. Another councilman is facing unrelated federal allegations that he helped smuggle Mexican immigrants into the U.S.

Mayor Ricardo Lopez resigned Friday afternoon, just days after he was arrested during a City Council meeting following a scuffle with an angry audience member  in full view of television cameras. That meeting was held to schedule a recall vote for Lopez and two City Council members.

Lopez's attorney has not returned multiple messages seeking comment.

""I feel bad talking about the little town where I grew up, but this is ridiculous,"" said Alicia Martinez, 33. ""We need help to get it back to where it used to be.""

The electronics company, which sells speaker systems, asked 30,000 people in eight countries about their music-listening habits and their personal relationships at home. Next, Sonos observed what happened when those people played music out loud in their homes.

According to a press release for its Music Makes it Home Study, Sonos found that people who cranked some tunes at home aloud with their partners the most had 67 percent more sex than those people who listened the least. The study also found the music-listening group spent an additional three hours and 13 minutes per week with the people in their homes, compared with those who didnt play music. Compared with silent homes, participants reported being in a better mood, expressing more love, feeling more inspired, and even laughing more after they began playing music.

""The truth is people may be sharing a home, but they aren't sharing much else. Music may be able to change that by bringing everyone back together,"" Dr. Daniel J. Levitin, neuroscientist, musician and author of the international bestselling book This is Your Brain on Music, said in a Sonos video that details some of the study findings. ""This study takes an important step forward in showing how listening to music out loud can enhance relationships at home.""

Sonos also found playing music out loud at home resulted in 43 percent of study participants feeling extremely loved an 87 percent reported increase from when they didnt play music. Eighty-three percent of participants said they felt doing chores was easier while listening to music, and 50 percent reported enjoying cooking more while doing the activity. Researchers also observed couples spent 20 percent more time together in the kitchen, and that 23 percent received more help from kids while cooking, when music was playing.

The company said it vetted respondents to ensure they didnt own Sonos products and that they lived with at least one other person, among other rules. Sonos collected data from motion-activated cameras, iBeacon, iPhones and Apple Watches.

The study ultimately drew its results from survey responses and observations and didnt use a randomized, controlled model which means it didnt meet the gold standard for scientific research, which is thought to eliminate the potential for bias. But Sonos said in the release that its survey sample was representative, and that it took answers from residents in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and France.

If you take the surveys findings to heart, you may find you and your honey will reap the benefits of turning up the tunes regardless of your musical taste the study didnt discriminate by musical genre.","[]"

"304","foxnews","2013-04-13 00:00:00","How to do a free online background check","[]","Have you done an online background check of yourself lately? There are several reasons you should.

There might be erroneous information about you floating around the Internet or in your credit report. Maybe you'll find a picture of yourself or a comment you made years ago somewhere that's a little embarrassing.

These things will pop up and hurt your chances the next time you apply for a loan or a job. Fortunately, you can take steps to correct or remove this damaging information.

It's also a very good idea to do a background check before taking on a roommate or going out on a date with that new crush you met online. You never know what sort of worrying or dangerous details could be lurking in someone's past.

Because checking people's background is such a pressing need, there are dozens of ways to go about this. Fortunately, several ways won't cost you a thing.

Before I continue, I should point out a tricky fact about background checks. If you are performing a background check as a landlord or employer - or for credit, medical or insurance reasons -- you can't use just any service.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have to use a Consumer Reporting Agency. A CRA has to maintain certain standards for data protection and offer dispute resolution.

If you do reject a potential tenant or employee (even semi-informal employees like domestic workers) based on a background check from a company that isn't a CRA, you could wind up in trouble.

You can find a fairly complete list of CRAs here on my website. The list is helpfully divided into categories such as credit reporting, employment history, insurance, renting and so on. Note that you can request and dispute the information that these CRAs have on file for you.

For checking on potential roommates or romantic partners, you can use just about any service or (legal) method.

The simplest option for a background check is to hire a professional service. You can find dozens of background check agencies online.

You will need to watch out for scam companies. Look around at several companies to find the average price for a background check and avoid any companies that are too low or too high.

If you want to save some money and you have some time, you can do many of the same checks yourself. You might also dig up information on a person's habits or character that a professional might not consider. Click here for four sites that can really help you learn about someone. They comb Google, Facebook and other information websites to find out details that the person has willingly shared.

A Google search could turn up other things about the person that might make you think twice, too. However, you probably won't see important details about whether they've been arrested or evicted in the past.

Luckily, most court information is public record. To find it, go to your state's official government website or find the information you need at the National Center for State Courts. Make sure you search every state that the person you're checking has lived in.

After that, you might want to drill down to discover any felony and misdemeanor convictions on the county and city level. Keep an eye out for civil judgments, too, such as a bankruptcies and court orders to pay debts.

In most cases, a credit report can't be pulled without a legitimate business purpose and written permission. A good strategy for screening a roommate would be to ask him or her to volunteer a report.

All consumers are entitled to get a free copy of their credit report once a year from the three reporting agencies - Equifax, Experian and Trans Union.

The more information you have about a person, the better your searches will be. Knowing a middle name and date of birth will help you weed out people with similar names.

If you aren't completely sure you've found the right person, don't act on the information until you've verified it is actually them. Being penalized for something that isn't your fault isn't fun.

The television report said Sunday's blasts struck in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa  a frequent target for similar explosions.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists around Syria, said the blasts killed 25 and wounded more than 100. The Observatory said the blasts were caused by two vehicles rigged with explosives after reporting earlier that it was not immediately clear if the second was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attacker wearing an explosive belt.

The report aired footage of the destruction caused by the blasts. Debris and mangled cars filled the streets and the charred body of a man was seen being taken away on a stretcher.

The Zahra neighborhood is predominantly Alawite, the minority sect to which President Bashar Assad belongs.

Homs, once dubbed the capital of the Syrian revolution, has been hit with a wave of explosions in recent months, killing and wounding scores of people.

Bernie Sanders really hurt us on immigration reform, Huerta told Fox News Latino. In 2007 we had a great opportunity to get immigration reform passed. Sen. John McCain was at the table, Sen. Ted Kennedy was pushing that immigration reform bill and we could have gotten that bill out of the Senate and into the House and passed immigration reform.

Bernie Sanders came out against it, she said. He didnt call me. He didnt call all of us who have been working on immigration reform for the last 40 years. Instead, I dont know who he listened to, but that showed me he wasnt really paying attention.

Sanders votes against Kennedys 2007 immigration reform bill  and his vote in favor of giving protection to the anti-immigrant Minutemen group  have been major talking points for Clintons surrogates as the two Democrats battle for the support of Latinos in Nevada. Clinton and Sanders are running neck-in-neck in the polls in the lead-up to Saturdays crucial Nevada Caucus.

Since the presidential campaign season began, Clinton has been seen as the prohibitive favorite to win the Latino vote, but recently Sanders has been making inroads into that support, especially in Nevada.

As she sees her once-assured chances of winning Nevada slipping, Clinton has called an array of supporters to the state in an effort to drum up support for her and bash Sanders on issues like immigration  an important issue in a state that is 28 percent Hispanic.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, Congressman Luis Gutierrez have joined Huerta in berating Sanders immigration record in the lead-up to the Nevada Caucus.

In her interview with Fox News Latino, Huerta said the reason she is supporting Clinton goes beyond her opposition to Sanders record on immigration. Huerta said that she believes Clinton has a Latino heart.

Hillary has been with the Latino community since she was a young woman; many, many decades before she thought she was going to run for the presidency, Huerta said. Shes shown that she cares a lot about people. Shes got a lot of compassion.

Huerta made a name for herself nationally in the 1960s and gained notoriety for her work with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers of America union.

Now, more than 70 years after Pfc. Thomas E. Davis was killed in the war's final battle, a tangible reminder of her beloved sibling has been found on the Pacific island of Saipan  one of his Army dog tags.

""He was a great guy,"" said Hollingsworth, 82, who lives outside Dayton, Ohio, noting that some of her earliest memories are of the tall, thin sibling 17 years her senior who always sat next to her at the dinner table. ""He was always laughing and singing and whistling.""

Cultural historian Genevieve Cabrera told The Associated Press in an email that she found the discolored metal tag sticking out of the soil of a farm field on Saipan in early 2014. It was embossed with Davis' name, serial number, hometown and other information.

Cabrera recently gave the tag to members of Kuentai, a Japan-based organization that has found the remains of five 27th Division soldiers on Saipan. The group notified the AP this month about the dog tag's discovery in the hope that his relatives could be found. The AP tracked down members of the soldier's family with the help of Anthony Barger, the archivist for the Putnam County Public Library.

Kuentai representatives said they'll arrange to meet the Davis family in the U.S. to hand over the tag.

While it is relatively common to find canteens, weapons and even unexploded shells from the 100,000 Americans and Japanese who fought for 25 days on the 46-square-mile island, dog tags remain a rare find, Cabrera said. The tags, attached to a chain worn around the neck, were the only item of military-issued gear a soldier wore daily that included potentially life-saving information such as blood type and when a tetanus shot was administered.

A year before Davis died in the battle for Okinawa in April 1945, he earned one of the nation's highest military honors after surviving the bloody fighting on Saipan.

According to wartime records kept at the New York State Military Museum, home to many of the 27th Division's documents, Davis earned the Silver Star on Saipan in June 1944 for risking his own life to rescue a wounded comrade ""at a time when the American front was undergoing brutal Japanese artillery and mortar fire.""

Davis went into the Army in September 1941, three months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor drew the U.S. into WWII. He served in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division, a New York National Guard unit mobilized into active service in 1940.

Davis was with the 27th when it took part in the Okinawa invasion, which began on April 1, 1945. Three weeks later, he was shot by a Japanese sniper while again helping a wounded soldier, according to what Hollingsworth says military officials told the family. Davis died April 30, two months shy of his 28th birthday. Four years later, his body was brought back for reburial in his hometown.

Davis was born and raised on his family's farm in Roachdale in Putnam County, Indiana, 30 miles west of Indianapolis. His mother died when he was a young boy, and his father remarried. Davis had six siblings: an older brother, Harold, three half brothers and two half sisters, including Hollingsworth. The brothers have died. His other half-sister, Hazel Priest, 81, lives in Victoria, Texas, and several nieces and nephews live in Texas, Ohio and Indiana.

Hollingsworth said Tom Davis, of Victoria, a 57-year-old machinist who was named after his uncle, will likely get the dog tag.

According to an eBay listing, the Ghostbusters Hi-C Ecto-Cooler can is a super rare item never offered on eBay before.

The eBay seller, Rkv-ent, claims the can belongs to a friend who used to work for a marketing company and received the item recently.

The drink was a green-colored sugar concoction that was originally created in 1987 by Coca-Cold as a tie-in for cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters the animated spinoff of the 1984 movie. The show went off the air in 1991, but the drink was so popular, Coca-Cola continued to make it 2001. The character Slimer disappeared from the box in 1997.

The auction for the canwhich appears to be devoid of any contents--ends on Sunday, Feb. 21 and so far bids for the drink are over $175.

Speculation over the possibility of Coca-Cola bringing back the retro drink has been rife. In September, the company re-registered the trademark for the citrus drink and fans have continued to buzz about it.

This comes amid the reboot of several other nostalgic drinks, such as a frozen citrus-flavored soda Surge by Burger King.","[]"

"320","foxnews","2016-02-20 00:00:00","Justice Scalia, conservative leader, remembered in Mass service for his devotion to faith, family","[]","Thousands of people paid their final respects on Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in a funeral Mass in Washington that celebrated the conservative leaders devotion to his faith and family.

God bless dad for his faith, said the Rev. Paul Scalia, one of Justice Scalia's nine children, who led the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The deeper he went in his faith, the better public servant he was. God bless dad for his love of his family.

The roughly two-hour-long service was attended by such leaders in government and law as Vice President Joe Biden, former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 95-year-old retired Justice John Paul Stevens and the remaining eight high court justices.

Among them were Justice Clarence Thomas who read from the New Testament.

There was no eulogy in a service free of bipartisan politics.

However, the Rev. Scalia, a Catholic priest serving the diocese of Arlington, Va., shared some personal moments from his fathers life.

Scalia said his father once unknowingly stood in his line to confess sins, a Roman Catholic sacrament.

 Like heck Im confessing to you,  Scalia recalled his father later saying. The feeling was mutual.

Scalia, 79, died unexpectedly last weekend at a remote Texas ranch. He had spent nearly three decades on the high court.

The service, which began on an overcast day, concluded with the funeral procession headed to a private burial amid sunlight breaking through a grey sky.

Scalias flag-draped casket was brought to the church Saturday morning, in a short trip from the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Scalia's other sons and his sons-in-law served as pallbearers, carrying the casket into and out of the basilica, the countrys largest Roman Catholic church.

In additon to Scalia's wife of 55 years and their nine children and dozens of grandchildren, other dignitaries at the service included members of Congress and several federal judges who are considered possible replacements for Scalia. Among them were Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett and Chief Judge Merrick Garland, all of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Obama did not attend, despite criticism from some Republicans.

However, the president and first lady Michelle Obama were among the more than 6,000 people who paid tribute to Scalia at the Supreme Court building on Friday. His casket rested on a funeral bier that first held President Abraham Lincoln's casket after his assassination.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama's decision about the Mass was a ""respectful arrangement"" that took into account his large security detail.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, who also participated in the service, acknowledged the Scalia familys desire for a simple, parish-family mass, as much as possible.

Scalias unexpected death has touched off a sharp debate in Washington and across the country about whether Obama should nominate a replacement in his final roughly 10 months of office and whether he would attempt to make recess appointment -- appoint somebody to the high court while Congress is in recess over the extended Presidents Day weekend or during future recesses.

Republicans and others say the next president, who takes office in January 2017, should submit the nomination to the Congress.

GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz interrupted his campaign ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary to attend the Mass.

The Texas senator has been among those urging the Senate not to consider replacing Scalia until after the November election.

The GOP-led Senate is not expected to approve any appointment by Obama, who said after Scalias death he would make a consideration in time due.

Obama said Tuesday that he would not make a recess appointment full stop. But he said he would nominate somebody who would be indisputably qualified and whom any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

Never before had a funeral for a Supreme Court justice been held at the basilica. Three popes have visited the basilica: Pope John Paul II in 1979, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 and Pope Francis last year.

Citigroup Inc reported an 86 percent decline in fourth quarter earnings with net profits of $346 million, or 6 cents per share, compared to $2.60 billion, or 82 cents per share, one year ago. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)2015 Getty Images

Citibank is planning to sell the consumer banking operations it has operated for a century in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia as South America's three biggest economies suffer a major downturn.

The New York-based bank said Friday in a statement that its decision was prompted by a desire to allocate resources where it can generate the best returns.

The decision to eliminate its services affects depositors in more than 50 cities in the three countries.

The slowing of China's economy has plunged all three into an economic down spiral with Brazil, the region's biggest economy, struggling to emerge from its deepest recession since the 1930s. Foreign banks have taken a hit in dollar terms as the country's currency has collapsed although profits overall continue to rise as a result of some of the world's highest interest rate.

Although much smaller, its business in Argentina is storied.

Citibank in 1914 opened its first foreign branch in Argentina, when it rivaled Canada as an emerging agricultural powerhouse, and lumbered through decades of dictatorship, hyperinflation and pot-banging protesters outside its downtown headquarters during the country's 2001 financial crisis when it was ordered to seize depositors' accounts and make emergency loans to the government.

Argentina's current problems, including inflation that's forecast to surge to 30 percent this year amid several years of stagnant growth, seem far more mundane by comparison. And after years of fighting over defaulted debt with leftist former President Cristina Fernandez, the doors seemed wide open under her successor, Mauricio Macri, a former businessman who has made attracting foreign investment a top priority.

Next month, President Barack Obama will become the first U.S. president to visit Buenos Aires since Bill Clinton.

Citibank said it would still continue servicing corporate clients in the three countries.

The bank in 2014 dropped consumer banking in 11 other Latin America nations.

Several of Citibank's top executives over the years have been culled from their operations in South America, including former chairmen John Reed, who was raised in Argentina and Brazil to expat parents and oversaw the global bank in the 1980s and 1990s.

It's hard to keep things intimate and exciting when you're in a long-term, monogamous relationship. You're comfortable. There's no real need to go out of your way to impress each other anymore. You might have even let your bedroom activity become stale and predictable. But there is good news: A new study says that if you start adding some variety to your sex life, you'll be just as sexually satisfied as you were during the first six months of your relationship.

RELATED: 22 Things Guys Should Never Do on a Date

The study is one of the largest ever to examine what contributes to a satisfying sex life long-term, reports The Chicago Tribune. It looked at 38,747 married or cohabitating heterosexual couples who had been together three or more years, ranging in age from 18 to 65.

RELATED: The 14 Healthiest Snack Foods to Buy

Many of the couples had been together for two decades or more. ""If properly nurtured, passion can last for decades,"" the study states. ""Nearly two-thirds of sexually satisfied respondents reported that their sex lives now were as passionate as in their early days together. Over one-third of sexually satisfied men and women selected 'passionate' as the single best word (out of six) to describe their most recent sexual encounter.""

RELATED: Brad Pitt Is Back and Sexier than Ever

And what is the common thread for satisfied couples? It was the willingness to try new things. According to the study, nearly half of all satisfied and dissatisfied couples read sexual self-help books and articles, ""But what set sexually satisfied couples apart was that they actually tried some of the ideas,"" said lead author David Frederick, assistant professor in health psychology at Chapman University.

The satisfied men and women were more likely than the dissatisfied to say that yes, they spiced things up from time to time by doing things like trying a new position, acting out a sexual fantasy, or using sex toys. The data also revealed that sexually satisfied men and women gave and received more oral sex, had more consistent orgasms, and and engaged in more frequent sex.

To all of these findings we say: Duh. If you're getting off all the time, of course you and your partner will be satisfied, and of course you'll want to keep satisfying each other over and over (and over) again. So if the passion in your partnership is starting to fizzle out, it's probably time to try something different in the bedroom.

Three U.S. government agencies will team up to study whether artificial turf fields and playgrounds that use bits of recycled tires are exposing children to dangerous chemicals.

Limited studies have not shown an elevated health risk from playing on fields with the bits of recycled tires, known as tire crumb, but more comprehensive research is needed.

Artificial turf playing fields have become a popular alternative to grass fields for their durability, lower long-term cost and ease of maintenance.

U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Bill Nelson called on the Obama administration to conduct a comprehensive study on whether the rubber poses a health hazard.

In their letter, they cited research from a University of Washington soccer coach who found 153 reported cases of cancer involving athletes who spend significant periods of time playing on crumb rubber turf.

But 30 years ago, Americans had barely heard of this Japanese mainstay ... until a chef named Masayoshi Takayama brought more than spicy tuna and California rolls to the West Coast.

Takayama  his legions of fans know him simply as Masa  now owns the renowned sushi restaurant in New York City that bears his name. At Masa, the food isnt just a meal  its a dining experience, a place where customers can taste the master chefs artfully displayed rare foods. And rare doesn't come cheap; a couple can easily spend $1,500 there.

Masa says staying true to the art of sushi has been the key to his success.

His love of seafood began when he was a boy in Japan, working at his family's fish company right outside of Tokyo. Seeing it every day as a child made ""sashimi and sushi personal,"" he says, and it launched his love for the ingredients.

But Japanese tradition requires that sushi chefs go through a decades-long apprenticeship before they can earn the title of chef, and Masa took the traditional path, cleaning bathroom floors and washing dishes as an apprentice in some of Tokyo's finest restaurants.

More on this... Kitchen Superstars: Sushi master 'Masa' Takayama

He remembers having ""no money, no salary, just enough to survive and learn,"" and it took five years before he was even allowed in front of customers. But once he was, he knew there was no turning back. Working at the sushi counter is like a stage, like Broadway,"" he says.

Masa moved to Los Angeles in 1980, and seven years later he opened Ginza Sushi-ko, which became one of the city's most coveted reservations. The restaurant has been credited with the rise in sushis popularity not just in L.A., but throughout the U.S.

As his reputation grew, Masa moved to a larger space in Beverly Hills. But in 2004, after a call from acclaimed chef Thomas Keller, owner of French Laundry, Masa moved to New York. His restaurant on the East Coast quickly became as popular as the one hed owned in L.A., and in 2008it became the first Japanese restaurant in America to receive the culinary world's highest honor  three Michelin stars.

Today Masa is still evolving, from designing the dishware (he makes pottery, too) to opening restaurants from Las Vegas to Dubai.

""This is my passion and energy,"" he says. ""I don't want to stay in the same spot. I like to move always to something new, but still keep the Japanese technique, the Japanese flavor.""","[]"

Researchers analyzed data from nine previously published studies with a total of more than 430,000 participants and found that drinking two additional cups of coffee a day was linked to a 44 percent lower risk of developing liver cirrhosis.

""Cirrhosis is potentially fatal and there is no cure as such,"" said lead study author Dr. Oliver Kennedy of Southampton University in the U.K.

""Therefore, it is significant that the risk of developing cirrhosis may be reduced by consumption of coffee, a cheap, ubiquitous and well-tolerated beverage,"" Kennedy added by email.

Cirrhosis kills more than one million people every year worldwide. It can be caused by hepatitis infections, excessive alcohol consumption, immune disorders, and fatty liver disease, which is tied to obesity and diabetes.

Kennedy and colleagues did a pooled analysis of average coffee consumption across earlier studies to see how much adding two additional cups each day might influence the odds of liver disease.

Combined, the studies included 1,990 patients with cirrhosis.

In eight of the nine studies analyzed, increasing coffee consumption by two cups a day was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cirrhosis.

In all but one study, the risk of cirrhosis continued to decline as daily cups of coffee climbed.

Compared to no coffee consumption, researchers estimated one cup a day was tied to a 22 percent lower risk of cirrhosis. With two cups, the risk dropped by 43 percent, while it declined 57 percent for three cups and 65 percent with four cups.

But the results still leave some unresolved questions.

One study, for example, found a stronger link between coffee consumption and reduced cirrhosis risk with filtered coffee than with boiled coffee.

And, while the studies accounted for alcohol consumption, not all them accounted for other cirrhosis risk factors like obesity and diabetes, the authors note in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, online January 25.

Patients also shouldn't take the findings to mean loading up on frothy caramel lattes packed with sugar and topped with whipped cream is a good way to prevent liver disease, Kennedy cautioned. It's also not clear exactly how coffee might lead to a healthier liver, or whether the type of beans or brewing method matter.

""Coffee is a complex mixture containing hundreds of chemical compounds, and it is unknown which of these is responsible for protecting the liver,"" Kennedy said.

It's also important to note that coffee isn't powerful enough to counteract lifestyle choices that can severely damage the liver, said Samantha Heller, a senior clinical nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York who wasn't involved in the study.

""Unfortunately, although coffee contains compounds that have antioxidant effects and anti-inflammatory properties, drinking a few cups of coffee a day cannot undo the systematic damage that is the result of being overweight or obese, sedentary, excessive alcohol consumption or drastically mitigate an unhealthy diet,"" Heller said by email.","[]"

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)

Pope Francis on Sunday urged Catholic leaders to show ""exemplary"" courage by not allowing executions this year, while expressing hope that eventually the death penalty will be abolished worldwide.

Francis told tourists and pilgrims in St. Peter's Square that ""the commandment 'do not kill' holds absolute value and applies to both the innocent and the guilty.""

He added that there is ""an ever more widespread opposition in public opinion to the death penalty, even only as an instrument of legitimate social defense.""

""I appeal to the conscience of those who govern so that international consensus is reached for the abolishment of the death penalty,"" the pope said. ""And I propose to all those among them who are Catholic to make a courageous and exemplary gesture: may no execution sentence be carried out in this Holy Year of Mercy.""

Francis is using the church's Holy Year, which runs through Nov. 20, to encourage efforts for more reconciliation and mercy in the world.

The pope is building on church teaching, laid out by St. John Paul II, that there's no justification for capital punishment.

""In effect, modern societies have the possibility to efficiently repress crime without taking away definitely the possibility to redeem oneself from those who committed"" the crime, Francis said.

The pope said ""even criminals hold the inviolable right to life"" given by God.

Francis called on all Christians and all those of good will to work not only to abolish capital punishment but also to improve prison conditions.

From the start of his papacy, he has expressed concern that inmates in jails and prisons should be treated with dignity. He has often visited prisons during his trips throughout Italy and abroad, including last week while in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

While the pope insists he doesn't interfere in the political sphere, he has also made clear people must follow what he calls a ""well-informed"" conscience, and that local bishops can give guidance to Catholics, including voters, on political issues.

Gratuitous. Nasty. Petty. Spiteful. Insulting. Just plain rude. When the rhetoric of a major partys leading presidential candidate falls to this level, we should be scornful.

So, how is it OK when it isnt just a presidential candidate, but a president, who does it?

Donald Trumps policy of demeaning and snarking his political opponents has been a favorite habit of President Obama for the last eight years. Obama is perhaps the first president who believes that leading the country and playing to the beliefs of the extremists in his own party amount to the same thing, and like Trump fans, Obama fans are motivated in large degree by sheer hatred.

They love to hear their idol channel their rage by bashing people they dont like.

Obamas latest, silent insult  leaving a spokesman to explain he had better things to do on a Saturday than attend the funeral of a 30-year justice of the Supreme Court  isnt surprising when you consider the mean-spirited things he says virtually every time he steps in front of a microphone.

This week Obama spokesman Josh Earnest bashed Sen. Chuck Schumer, who objected to cuts in counterterrorism funding for New York. Earnest said, in essence, why listen to this fool on anything if he opposed the Iran deal, especially since most Democrats were in favor?

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, accurately, that this was pure politics  the president was punishing New York to get back at Schumer.","[]"

The state broadcaster led bulletins with well-wishes for Mugabe, the world's oldest head of state who has been in power for 36 years, while the state-run Sunday Mail newspaper published a 16-page supplement for the birthday. ""Mugabe's birthday is like that of Jesus Christ,"" proclaimed posters promoting the newspaper's special edition.

Public celebrations will be held on Feb. 27 in the southeastern city of Masvingo, near the historic site of Great Zimbabwe. Mugabe's birthday has been publicly celebrated since 1986 and while political leaders would not divulge the budget for this year's party, in the past the event has cost up to $1 million for the transportation, accommodation and food for thousands of guests.

This year's party will be held as Zimbabwe is choked by a drought that has left over 3 million people reliant on food aid, mainly supplied by the United States and the European Union, according to the World Food Program and the United Nations Development Program. The lavish birthday celebrations have been criticized by Mugabe's opponents, but the president's supporters insist the party will go ahead as planned.

Ruling party politicians and businesspeople paid from $5,000 to $100,000 for a table of 10 at a dinner Friday night to raise funds for the birthday festivities. The dinner on Friday was sold out, said Tongai Kasukuwere, a member of the ruling ZANU-PF party's youth wing and the event's organizer.

""To be able to mobilize resources to honor one of Africa's finest icons during such a difficult time proves our resilience,"" said Kasukuwere. ""It is not like we are taking grain meant for drought programs to feed people at the celebrations. These are voluntary donors.""

Outside the banquet, some Zimbabweans were bitterly critical of the birthday plans.

""Maybe they have no shame, openly feasting amid such hunger,"" said Denias Munongoza, 27, a college graduate who sells cigarettes and condoms to feed his family. ""This year the president should have said 'no.'""

""Mugabe and his cronies are planning to feast instead of attending to the resuscitation of the comatose economy and addressing the effects and impact of the drought,"" said Obert Gutu, spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change-T.","[]"

A new study suggests that the way your brain works may vary from season to season. Researchers found that when people in the study did certain cognitive tasks, the ways the brain utilizes its resources to complete those tasks changed with the seasons.

Although peoples actual performance of the tasks did not change with the seasons, the brain activity for the ongoing process varied.

Participants were observed during each season of the year for a period of four and a half days in a lab. They had no access to the external world or seasonal cues such as daylight. Researchers scanned their brains while they performed tasks testing their ability to sustain attention and to store, update, and compare information in their memories.

They found that the peoples performance on these tasks did not change, regardless of the time of year. However results did show that the neurol cost of performing the tasks did change with the time of the year.

Im proud of the campaign that we have run to unify our country, Bush said. But the people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision. So tonight I am suspending my campaign.

Bush was mired in single digits in South Carolina returns and had failed to place in the top three in any of the early contests. Bush, the former Florida governor, entered the 2016 presidential race as an early favorite, but steadily fell in the polls, despite having had a couple strong debate performances in recent weeks.

The presidency is bigger than any one person, Bush said during an emotional speech. It is certainly bigger than any candidate.

He added that he firmly believed ""the American people must entrust this office to someone who understands that whoever holds it is a servant, not the master.""

But Bushs campaign seemed to struggle out of the gate. He first promised to run as his own man and distanced himself from his family but later relied on the Bush family name on the campaign trail.

The son of George H. W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush entered the race to huge expectations in June, and quickly fueled them with fundraising. Working with a super PAC that has supported his candidacy, Bush and allies raised more than $150 million by the end of 2015 -- far more than any of his GOP rivals.

However, Bush's presence in the race and fundraising potential wasn't enough to dissuade more than a dozen other Republicans from entering the race, including fellow Floridian, Sen. Marco Rubio.

Fundraising reports filed Saturday night show how dire Bush's financial situation had become.

His big-money super PAC raised just $379,000 in January, and most of that was from a single donor who'd also given the same amount to rival Marco Rubio. The group, Right to Rise, had blown through more than $85 million over the past nine months, largely on TV ads, bashing other candidates, most notably Rubio.

Meanwhile, Bush's official campaign -- which provided basic funding for his travel and political staff -- had less than $3 million in available cash as the month began. He had only been able to raise $1.6 million in January, despite a once-sprawling donor network.

Bush's failure to ignite was not simply a factor of the size of the GOP field. Bush, like others, was caught off-guard by the durable popularity of political outsiders -- particularly Trump.

The final stage of Bush's campaign became an all-out bout with the outspoken real estate mogul -- the two frequently referring to each other as a ""loser."" Bush took shots at Trump's lack of experience while Trump attacked Bush's family legacy, particularly the unpopular Iraq war waged by his brother George W. Bush.

Bush, meanwhile, offered himself as an experienced public executive and potential world statesman informed in part by his father's and brother's wartime presidencies. But it wasn't a case strong enough to translate into votes.

""I just don't see a third Bush presidency,"" Julie Michau of Beaufort, South Carolina, said Wednesday after attending a Bush event.

There were other problems as well. The policy-oriented Bush was overshadowed in early debates by Trump and Rubio, which dramatically slowed his early autumn fundraising.

Bush went on to finish sixth in the Iowa caucuses, but barely squeezed ahead of Rubio in New Hampshire for a fourth place finish. South Carolina was viewed as a last early voting state for Bush to make a mark.

While the South Carolina primary claimed Bush, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who returns indicate will finish either last or second-to-last, has vowed to stay in the race.

In a lengthy speech, Carson told his supporters that people are being easily manipulated and told what they are supposed to think and who they are supposed to follow. He added that he truly believes as time goes on more and more people will begin to get serious.

The debate over whether New Zealand should take Australia's unwanted asylum seekers comes amid an uproar over what will happen to 267 asylum seekers who are expected to be transferred from Australia to the Pacific atoll of Nauru. The issue of their fate was raised amid annual talks between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his visiting New Zealand counterpart John Key.

Australia refuses to allow any asylum seekers who try to reach the country's shores by boat to ever settle in Australia, and sends them instead to detention camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has virtually stopped asylum seekers from the Middle East and Asia attempting to reach Australia on rickety boats.

The 267 asylum seekers came from Nauru's detention camp to Australia for medical treatment or to support a relative who needed treatment. They refused to return to Nauru pending an Australian High Court challenge to the legality of Australia's refugee policy, but the court recently ruled against them, leaving them at risk of deportation.

The court decision sparked outrage among refugee advocates, two of whom climbed to the top of a 160-meter (500-foot) tower in Melbourne on Friday to unfurl a banner with the Twitter hashtag LetThemStay.

Key's government reached an agreement in 2013 with Australia to resettle 150 refugees a year from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. On Friday, Key said the offer still stands, provided the asylum seekers meet New Zealand's character requirements and are genuine refugees.

""So I can't tell you who might or might not be able to come, or whether the Australian government would want to exercise the right to do that,"" Key told reporters in a joint press conference with Turnbull. ""All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table.""

But Turnbull appeared to dismiss the offer, saying the government didn't want to give people smugglers ""marketing opportunities"" to recruit asylum seekers to embark on the dangerous journey.

""We take into account what John has proposed ... but we do so very thoughtfully, recognizing that the one thing we must not do is give an inch to the people smugglers,"" Turnbull told reporters.","[]"

Fernando Cardenal, one of the priests who famously rebuffed a papal order to quit Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, died in Managua on Saturday. He was 82 and long back in the good graces of the church.

The Jesuit was a practitioner of liberation theology and he who joined the Sandinista rebels after they toppled the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979, first leading a widely praised literacy campaign and then serving as education minister.

The participation of priests such as Cardenal, his brother Ernesto and Miguel d'Escoto in the leftist government irked Pope John Paul II, who publicly wagged his finger at Ernesto Cardenal during a papal visit to the country in 1983. A year later, they were among four suspended from the priesthood for refusing to leave their political posts. Ernesto Cardenal, perhaps Nicaragua's best-known poet, was culture minister and d'Escoto was foreign minister.

In an open ""Letter to my Friends"" published in late 1984, Fernando Cardenal defended his decision in theological terms, saying, ""I believe before God that I would be committing a grave sin"" by abandoning a post committed to the poor.

""I cannot conceive of a God that would ask me to abandon my commitment to the people,"" he said.

Fernando Cardenal left his Cabinet post in 1990 and, like his brother, eventually broke with the main Sandinista Front led by Daniel Ortega.

In a step even more unusual than his suspension, he was reinstated to the Jesuit order in 1997 and until his death was heading the Nicaragua office of Fe and Alegria, a Jesuit program that brings schools to poor parts of Nicaragua and other countries.

The agency confirmed the death in a statement, praising his ""tireless struggle to defend the rights of the most vulnerable.""

Local news media said the death resulted from complications following a surgery two weeks ago.

Pope John Paul II told Cardenal and other priests  including Cardenal's brother Ernesto  to quit politics. When they refused, he suspended them from the priesthood in 1984.

Cardenal left politics in 1990 and was reinstated as a Jesuit in 1997  an extremely unusual step.

He spent his last years leading a Jesuit organization running schools in poor parts of the country.

ALSO: Danny Ainge said the mystery team involved would've surprised fans because rumor was ""never reported"" #Celtics https://t.co/wT5QixfFn2  Adam Kaufman (@AdamMKaufman) February 19, 2016

Info Ainge gave me indicated #Celtics near-deal did NOT involve Horford, Howard, Griffin, Love or other previously reported stars.  Adam Kaufman (@AdamMKaufman) February 19, 2016

Ainge wouldn't say who that player was, and he wouldn't reveal the team that he said backed out of a trade at the very last minute. But now, via Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald, we may have an answer.

That is not to say this isn't a team of talented players with very good attitudes that is very entertaining and can hang with some of the best in the league on given regular-season nights. But not even the most optimistic Greenheart believes this roster is ready to play in June.



Danny Ainge clearly doesn't. And that is healthy. It's why he spent the last several days trying to get the kind of magnetic player needed to lift the Celtics from the NBA's middle earth. While a league source has indicated the late target Ainge has referred to in radio interviews was Philadelphia's Jahlil Okafor, Ainge has turned silent on the matter.

The biggest asset the Celtics have at the moment (assuming they don't want to give up a key player like Isaiah Thomas) is the 2016 first round draft pick that is coming their way from the Brooklyn Nets. The fact that they wouldn't part with it in exchange for Okafor doesn't necessarily mean that the team is planning on using it. But it does make you believe that Ainge and company feel like it can bring back even stronger offers when teams have a little more time to breath once the current season is finished.

As an aside, it seems fairly random and unnecessary for Ainge to boast about a deal that never took place. Boston is overachieving this season, so the fans wouldn't appear to be in need of reassurances that the team's GM is actually doing his job.","[]"

Named ASTRO-H, the observatory includes five specialized X-ray space telescopes and detectors developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). This allows scientists to examine cosmic sources of X-rays at unpreceded resolutions and explore the most energetic and mysterious phenomena in the Universe, involving particles at energies that can't be readily produced in Earth-based labs.

In a statement, JAXA said the launch of ASTRO-H on the H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 30 was successful and that the satellite  which it nicknamed Hitomi  was currently in good health. The launch took place at Tahegashima Space Center on the Japanese island of the same name at 5:45 p.m. (3:45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time).

The launch was originally scheduled for Feb. 12 but postponed due to bad weather.

The project, which includes contributions from the United States, Europe and Canada, is nothing short of ambitious. According to JAXA, the goal is to study the structure of the universe and physics in extreme conditions and answer several questions critical to astronomy  how do black holes develop? How are galaxy clusters created? When were heavy elements in the universe created and how much?

Could the slate of presidential candidates do much better? The Tax Foundation took a detailed look at the impacts of tax plans of the candidates to determine just that.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Associated Press)

When it comes to overall economic growth over the next 10 years, Senator Ted Cruz beats the bunch with his policies contributing to an additional 13.9 percent growth over and above what government projects for the economy during those years. In other words, in each of the next 10 years, his tax policies would add another 1.39 percent worth of growth each year. Donald Trumps tax plan would add an additional 11.5 percent growth over the decade or 1.15 percent growth each year. Senator Bernie Sanders is the worst performer because his tax plan would push down growth by 9.5 percent over the decade, while Hillary Clintons plan is pretty much a wash, pushing down growth by 1 percent over the 10 years.

Related Image Expand / Contract

Keep in mind that critics say plans like Trumps would fail to fund anything other than the big entitlement programs. Under Trump, defense programs, for example, would go begging. The Tax Foundation analysis shows Trumps plan reducing government revenues by nearly $12 trillion over ten years, the most of any candidate.

If its job growth youre interested in, Trumps is the biggest winner. His tax plan would grow jobs by 5.3 million over 10 years. The worst? Sanders, whose tax plan would cut jobs by 5.9 million.

Wage growth, another critical metric for Americans because weve had so little of it, is highest under the Cruz plan, growth rates in wages would jump 12.2 percent. And, workers would definitely feel the burn under Sanders, whose plans would cut wage growth rates by 4.3 percent. Trumps wage rate growth would be half of that of Cruz, at 6.5 percent. Clintons plan does little to move the needle in any direction when it comes to wage growth or job growth.

One big takeaway from the Tax Foundation analysis is this: It takes massive change to move the economy significantly with tax policy alone. The American economy is massive, still the biggest in the world, and encouraging it to expand is tough work for legislators.","[]"

Rowlings books has never been stronger. With a new Hogwarts Castle opening in California, the eighth Harry Potter story brought to life on stage and a magical film set in 1920s New York City arriving in November, life is good for Harry Potter fans. Heres a host of upcoming events for the aspiring wizard in all of us.

1.&nbspApril 7: Grand Opening Wizarding World of Harry Potter  Universal Studios Hollywood Universal Studios Hollywood Hogwarts is coming to Hollywood! Ever since Wizarding World opened in Florida, Harry Potter fans have wanted one on the West Coast. On April 7, Hogwarts will open the gates to its branch campus in Hollywood. Like its counterparts in Orlando and Japan, attractions will include Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster and a recreation of the shops and restaurants of Hogsmeade Village. Get a sneak peek here.

2.&nbspApril 16-17: Quidditch World Cup 9  Columbia, S.C. US Quidditch In 2005, students at Middlebury College in Vermont stuck brooms between their legs and brought the game of Quidditch to life. Since then, teams have popped up around the world. More than 80 of them are expected to try to toss the quaffle through the goal hoops on the pitch in Columbia in the Quidditch Leagues largest spectator event.

3.&nbspMay 27: Warner Bros. Studio Tour, London Warner Bros. Studio Tour Visitors to London can tour the sets where the first Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, was filmed. To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the premiere, the Warner Bros. Studio Tour is opening up filming locations that the public has never seen before, including 4 Privet Drive, the house where the dastardly Dursleys kept Harry in a room under the staircase. The special anniversary celebration begins on May 27.

4.&nbspJuly 30: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Play, London Pottermore Rowling, along with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, has written the eighth story in the Harry Potter series, and the only place to find it will be on the London stage. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, set 19 years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, finds Harry balancing his work at the Ministry of Magic with caring for his three children. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a two-part play that should be seen in consecutive performances, premieres at the London West End Palace Theatre on July 30.

5.&nbspVarious Dates and Locations: Fan Conventions AP Fan conventions are always a wonderful way to make new friends who share your passion for Harry Potter. San Diego Comic Con (July 21-24) is the largest celebration of pop culture on the planet and will no doubt have a strong Wizarding World presence. But there are smaller fan conventions like Leviosa Con, July 7-10 in Las Vegas, and Leaky Con, Oct. 19-23 in Los Angeles, that are dedicated solely to Harry Potter. Expect to find special guests, film stars, fan fiction and even Wizard Rock at these dedicated fan events.

6.&nbspNow through Feb. 28 Harry Potter: The Exhibition, Shanghai Harry Potter: The Exhibition This interactive exhibition of costumes and props from the highest grossing film series of all time has traveled the world, from Chicago to New York to Paris to the Superbrand Mall in Shanghai, where it opened in December. Harry Potter: The Exhibition features Lord Voldemorts Horcruxes; Harrys school uniform, glasses and wand; Marauders Map; Time-Turner; Nimbus 2000; Buckbeak the Hippogriff; and much more. Families can enter the Quidditch area and toss a quaffle, pull their own Mandrake in the Herbology vignette, and much more. Timed tickets are required for admission.

FOXs Gary Baumgarten reports:

[audio:http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/ak.podcast.foxnewsradio.com/news/dotcom/NYCTERROR_021816.mp3]

New York City as everyone knows was hit by the worst terrorist attack in history on September 11, 2001 and counter-terrorism experts say its still a potential target.

Thats why theres always a heightened state of vigilance here. But now, the Obama administration wants to cut anti-terrorism funding to the Big Apple:

(Blasio) We cant reduce funding to stop terror at a point when the terror threat is greater than ever. It makes no sense.

Thats Mayor Bill de Blasio, joined by Democratic New York Senator Charles Schumer, who made an unusual rebuff of the Obama administration.

The White House counters that it is still providing what it calls robust funding to New York City.

"370","foxnews","2016-02-21 00:00:00","Study suggests simple key to great long-term sex life","[]","We know, we know. It's hard to keep things intimate and exciting when you're in a long-term, monogamous relationship. You're comfortable. There's no real need to go out of your way to impress each other anymore. You might have even let your bedroom activity become stale and predictable. But there is good news: A new study says that if you start adding some variety to your sex life, you'll be just as sexually satisfied as you were during the first six months of your relationship.

RELATED: 22 Things Guys Should Never Do on a Date

The study is one of the largest ever to examine what contributes to a satisfying sex life long-term, reports The Chicago Tribune. It looked at 38,747 married or cohabitating heterosexual couples who had been together three or more years, ranging in age from 18 to 65.

RELATED: The 14 Healthiest Snack Foods to Buy

Many of the couples had been together for two decades or more. ""If properly nurtured, passion can last for decades,"" the study states. ""Nearly two-thirds of sexually satisfied respondents reported that their sex lives now were as passionate as in their early days together. Over one-third of sexually satisfied men and women selected 'passionate' as the single best word (out of six) to describe their most recent sexual encounter.""

RELATED: Brad Pitt Is Back and Sexier than Ever

And what is the common thread for satisfied couples? It was the willingness to try new things. According to the study, nearly half of all satisfied and dissatisfied couples read sexual self-help books and articles, ""But what set sexually satisfied couples apart was that they actually tried some of the ideas,"" said lead author David Frederick, assistant professor in health psychology at Chapman University.

RELATED: Shirtless Nick Jonas Explains How He Got His New

Buff Body

The satisfied men and women were more likely than the dissatisfied to say that yes, they spiced things up from time to time by doing things like trying a new position, acting out a sexual fantasy, or using sex toys. The data also revealed that sexually satisfied men and women gave and received more oral sex, had more consistent orgasms, and and engaged in more frequent sex.

RELATED: The Fastest Way to Get Ripped

To all of these findings we say: Duh. If you're getting off all the time, of course you and your partner will be satisfied, and of course you'll want to keep satisfying each other over and over (and over) again. So if the passion in your partnership is starting to fizzle out, it's probably time to try something different in the bedroom.

SEE ALSO: US Coast Guard hearings to probe El Faro sinking in hurricane



Captain Michael Davidson pleaded for help as his ship, operated by Tote Services, sailed into the path of Hurricane Joaquin near the Bahamas, according to a recording of his final calls played at the hearing.

He told an on-shore call center of a ""maritime emergency,"" saying water breached the hull, entering three holds.

Soon afterwards, contact with the ship was broken, and Davidson and 32 others were lost at sea. The sinking ranks as the worst disaster involving a U.S.-flagged cargo ship in more than three decades.

Recordings of the calls, made last October, were posted on the website of WOKV, a Jacksonville radio station.



Images from the wreck:



The U.S. Coast Guard began hearings this week to investigate the sinking. Executives of Tote Services have testified that ship captains have full responsibility for deciding when it is safe to sail and on setting the route.

Tote officials said it was Davidson's call to depart Jacksonville with a storm brewing in the Atlantic, and said they were not closely monitoring the El Faro's cargo run to Puerto Rico as a tropical storm strengthened into Joaquin.

On the phone call to shore, Davidson sounds frustrated with an operator who asked him to spell the name of the boat, telling her ""the clock is ticking.""

In a voicemail to Tote's ""designated person ashore"" John Lawrence, Davidson said that he had had a ""navigational incident"" and a ""pretty good list,"" referring the water in the holds, and that while the crew was safe he needed to talk to Lawrence.

Lawrence said that he had called Davidson back quickly, and the veteran Maine mariner sounded calm, according to WOKV. Lawrence then called the Coast Guard.

Family members of dead crew members have sued Tote in federal court.

After the 790-foot (241-meter) vessel was lost, the company bought a subscription for a bad-weather routing system for its ships, Tote President Philip Greene, testified this week.

The Coast Guard's hearings continue through next Thursday.

The investigation could result in civil charges. If evidence of criminal activity is found, the Coast Guard will turn it over to the Justice Department.

The 24-year-old, who already holds two math degrees, will begin his math PhD at MIT this offseason, specializing in spectral graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and machine learning, the Baltimore Sun reports.

Urschel was already well-known for his academic achievements, having taught trigonometry and analytic geometry as part of his master's degree while playing at Penn State, reports Onward State.

His published research includes ""A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians."" ""There's nothing I love more than crunching numbers, except maybe crunching defensive linemen on the football field,"" Urschel, who did advanced math problems to test how well he was recovering from a concussion last year, writes in his math-meets-football column at the Players' Tribune.

"377","foxnews","2016-02-20 00:00:00","Justice Scalia, conservative leader, remembered in Mass service for his devotion to faith, family","[]","Thousands of people paid their final respects on Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in a funeral Mass in Washington that celebrated the conservative leaders devotion to his faith and family.

God bless dad for his faith, said the Rev. Paul Scalia, one of Justice Scalia's nine children, who led the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The deeper he went in his faith, the better public servant he was. God bless dad for his love of his family.

The roughly two-hour-long service was attended by such leaders in government and law as Vice President Joe Biden, former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 95-year-old retired Justice John Paul Stevens and the remaining eight high court justices.

Among them were Justice Clarence Thomas who read from the New Testament.

There was no eulogy in a service free of bipartisan politics.

However, the Rev. Scalia, a Catholic priest serving the diocese of Arlington, Va., shared some personal moments from his fathers life.

Scalia said his father once unknowingly stood in his line to confess sins, a Roman Catholic sacrament.

 Like heck Im confessing to you,  Scalia recalled his father later saying. The feeling was mutual.

Scalia, 79, died unexpectedly last weekend at a remote Texas ranch. He had spent nearly three decades on the high court.

The service, which began on an overcast day, concluded with the funeral procession headed to a private burial amid sunlight breaking through a grey sky.

Scalias flag-draped casket was brought to the church Saturday morning, in a short trip from the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Scalia's other sons and his sons-in-law served as pallbearers, carrying the casket into and out of the basilica, the countrys largest Roman Catholic church.

In additon to Scalia's wife of 55 years and their nine children and dozens of grandchildren, other dignitaries at the service included members of Congress and several federal judges who are considered possible replacements for Scalia. Among them were Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett and Chief Judge Merrick Garland, all of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Obama did not attend, despite criticism from some Republicans.

However, the president and first lady Michelle Obama were among the more than 6,000 people who paid tribute to Scalia at the Supreme Court building on Friday. His casket rested on a funeral bier that first held President Abraham Lincoln's casket after his assassination.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama's decision about the Mass was a ""respectful arrangement"" that took into account his large security detail.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, who also participated in the service, acknowledged the Scalia familys desire for a simple, parish-family mass, as much as possible.

Scalias unexpected death has touched off a sharp debate in Washington and across the country about whether Obama should nominate a replacement in his final roughly 10 months of office and whether he would attempt to make recess appointment -- appoint somebody to the high court while Congress is in recess over the extended Presidents Day weekend or during future recesses.

Republicans and others say the next president, who takes office in January 2017, should submit the nomination to the Congress.

GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz interrupted his campaign ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary to attend the Mass.

The Texas senator has been among those urging the Senate not to consider replacing Scalia until after the November election.

The GOP-led Senate is not expected to approve any appointment by Obama, who said after Scalias death he would make a consideration in time due.

Obama said Tuesday that he would not make a recess appointment full stop. But he said he would nominate somebody who would be indisputably qualified and whom any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

Never before had a funeral for a Supreme Court justice been held at the basilica. Three popes have visited the basilica: Pope John Paul II in 1979, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 and Pope Francis last year.

Just 19 laps into ""The Great American Race,"" the Sprint Cup rookie lost control of his No. 24 Chevrolet coming out of Turn 4 and slid into the grass infield. The front end of his car lifted off the ground, and the rough ride caused enough damage that his car had to be towed to the garage.

""We had a real fast car all week out here,"" Elliott said. ""Hate to see it end so soon. We'll just try and get out there and make some laps.""

The 20-year-old Elliott, son of Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, shined during his first Sprint Cup Speedweeks. He became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500 pole. He also won the second-tier Xfinity Series race Saturday.

Elliott replaced four-time champion Jeff Gordon in the iconic 24 at Hendrick Motorsports. Gordon was in the broadcast booth at Daytona, calling the shots as the No. 24 went around the track without him for the first time since 1992. He interviewed Elliott during the pace laps and asked how he expected to overcome his limited experience to win the race. Elliott told him his first goal was just to get the Chevy to the end of the race.

Not even close.

""Got in the middle and got loose,"" Elliott said.

Carl Edwards and Regan Smith also were involved in the wreck, the first of the day.

Even with the early exit, Elliott left a lofty mark at Daytona.

He became the youngest to win at Daytona in the Xfinity Series, getting to victory lane at 20 years, 2 months, 23 days. Elliott calmly climbed out of his car, grabbed the checkered flag and then pumped his fist a few times in the air.

A week earlier, Elliott won the pole at 20 years, 2 months and 17 days. The Elliotts became the fourth father-son combination to earn the Daytona 500 pole.

But none of his achievements seemed to matter as the banged-up 24 was towed to the garage.

Elliott eventually returned, but was 40 laps behind the leader.

""We will just have to look past it and get on for Atlanta,"" he said. ""That is the most important thing now. Can't get caught up in what happened today, it is irrelevant now.""","[]"

Kalamazoo resident Jason Dalton, 45, was arrested in a search and capture operation on Sunday morning, Lt. Dale Hinz told the daily Kalamazoo Gazette.

The shootings started about 6 p.m. on Saturday and were staged in three spots around the city of 320,000 located 220 km (136 mi.) west of Detroit.

""This is your worst nightmare. When you have somebody just driving around randomly killing people,"" Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said, adding that there appears to be no connection among the shootings.

Initially, police announced that a 14-year-old girl had also died in the shooting rampage, but they later said that she had been critically wounded.

The first shooting took place in the parking lot of an apartment complex where a woman was struck by four bullets.

The victim, who was seriously injured, was with three children at the time.

Shortly thereafter, two people were killed at a car dealership, and later the shooter gunned down four other people riding in two cars near the local Cracker Barrel restaurant. EFE","[]"

"381","foxnews","2016-02-16 00:00:00","Ancient Roman brooch contains 'lovely' palindrome","[]","A person with a metal detector has discovered a 1,800-year-old copper brooch, engraved with the letters ""RMA,"" on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It contains wordplay that is, quite literally, ""lovely,"" scientists have found.

The letters on the brooch, which dates to a time when the Roman Empire controlled Britain, contain different meanings depending on how they are read. When read left to right, the letters form a monogram for ""Roma,"" the name of Rome and its deity. ""Roma may be identified as Dea Roma, the deity personifying the city of Rome,"" researchers wrote in a paper set to be published in the journal Lucerna.

However, when read from right to left, the same letters form the monogram for ""Amor,"" the Latin name for Cupid, the god of love. ""The palindrome Roma-Amor was widely recognised and played on in antiquity,"" the researchers noted, referring to the fact that the word can be read backward or forward to spell the same phrase. [6 Most Tragic Love Stories in History]

There's yet another possible meaning. If the person who wore this brooch also wore a second brooch containing the monogram for Mars, the god of war, the full meaning of the two brooches combined could be ""Rome, (city) of Mars"" or ""Rome, beloved of Mars,"" the researchers wrote.

The different meanings could serve to ""perplex the viewer and thus deflect the risk of ill-fortune directed by a malign gaze,"" the researchers wrote.

The brooch was found by a person using a metal detector in December 2015. The discovery was reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), which keeps records of such finds.

Worn by a Roman soldier?

In ancient times, ""the brooch was probably attached to a tunic or cloak,"" using a pin, said Sally Worrell, one of the paper's authors and a national finds adviser with PAS.

The wearer of the brooch may have been a Roman soldier or veteran, the researchers said in the paper, noting that similar brooches have been found in Roman military garrisons in southern Germany and eastern Europe.

Although no Roman garrison has been identified so far on the Isle of Wight, researchers say it's possible that Roman soldiers traveled to the island, while Roman veterans could have settled on it.

Metal find

In England and Wales, it's legal for amateurs to use metal detectors to find artifacts, as long as they have permission from the landowner and they avoid archaeological sites that have been granted protection by the government. Certain finds (such as those made of precious metal) must be reported to antiquities authorities.

While the use of metal detectors by amateurs is legal, it is a controversial practice; some professional archaeologists say it can damage archaeological sites.

It's not known if the finder of the brooch will donate it to a museum.

Although the police department did not announce what is on the video, an ESPN source said it shows an encounter between Manziel, his ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley and a valet at the Hotel ZaZa in Dallas. According to an affidavit for a protection order, Crowley said that after arguing with Manziel in his hotel room, the Cleveland Browns quarterback led her down a back stairwell to the valet.

Crowley allegedly told the valet that she was ""scared for her life,"" but the valet said that he didn't know what to do. At which point, Manziel threw her into the passenger seat of the car and they drove away.

Crowley says that Manziel hit her and then threatened to commit suicide while they were en route to Fort Worth.

Police spokesman Maj. Midge Boyle said Saturday that investigators have reviewed medical records provided by Crowley and that they could conclude their domestic violence investigation by next week.

Manziel hasn't been charged, but a judge did issue Crowley a protection order against him.

Police haven't interviewed Manziel, but spoke to several other witnesses. Boyle says police want to have their strongest case against Manziel before speaking to him.

The Browns are expected to release Manziel in March.

The poster is part of a Black History Month exhibit at the Central Islip courthouse on Long Island. But three retired NYPD officers told CBS2 New York last week that the drawing doesnt belong in a courthouse. One referred to it as hate speech.

Black Lives Matter we feel is anti-police and the rhetoric that they spew is anti-police and weve actually had them on video walking the streets of New York City calling for the death of police officers, retired NYPD officer and Internet radio host Ed Munoz told the station. So for it to be hanging in a courtroom, we find outrageous.

The drawing reads: Stop The Violence. Black Lives Matter. Stop the Racism.

The verdict on the poster with courthouse visitors was split, the station reported.

I think its highly political and controversial, one said.

Another said, I dont think its anti-cop, its just awareness of whats going on in society today.

State judge C. Randall Hinrichs, who oversees the courts in Suffolk County, told CBS2 there are no plans to remove the poster.

It is not the intention of the court to put forth any anti-law enforcement message, he told the station. This is the cultural response of a middle school student, here in Central Islip, to present-day America.

Hinrichs said the last thing they want to do is offend law enforcement.

It talks about stopping violence and racism, which are admirable sentiments, and I know its interpreted by different people, different ways, he said.","[]"

The fire at a rural home south of Edgerton in Platte County was reported just before midnight Friday. Sheriff's Capt. Erik Holland said the house was fully engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived.

""Based on some of the preliminary investigation by the sheriff's office and the state fire marshal, we have determined that there are suspicious situations around the burning of the building and the deaths of the four individuals,"" Holland said Saturday. ""We're going to treat this investigation as a homicide at this point in time.""

Investigators including the state fire marshal and medical examiner were at the scene Saturday.

Two adult females, a third adult and an infant died in the fire. Holland said investigators haven't been able to determine whether two of the victims were male or female because of the extent of their injuries.

In an attempt to shield Venezuela's economy from further collapse and fend off mounting calls for his ouster, President Nicolas Maduro addressed the nation Wednesday night to announce a monumental gasoline price hike.

In this South American country, where gasoline has long been so heavily subsidized that it is virtually free, gasoline prices are a touchy issue in Venezuela  memories are still vivid from 1989 riots in Caracas that erupted after the proposal of a series of austerity measures including a hike in gas prices.

Maduro said gas prices will jump more than sixtyfold, yet drivers will still be able to fill their tanks for pennies.

He said the increased gasoline revenue will finance the government's social programs.

""We must charge for gas,"" he said. ""I ask that the people welcome and support this new system.""

The price of premium gasoline will rise from 0.1 bolivar a liter to 6 bolivars per liter, and regular gasoline will jump from 0.07 bolivar to 1 bolivar per liter. In contrast, a beer costs around 300 bolivars while a basket of strawberries goes for 800 bolivars. Calculated at the widely used black market currency exchange rate, the price per gallon will be a few U.S. cents.

Maduro also announced that the strongest of the country's official exchange rates, used for essential goods like food and medicine, would be changing from 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar to 10 bolivars to the dollar. Meanwhile, the bolivar is worth about 1,000 to the dollar on the black market.

The economic measures come as Maduro fights for his political survival.

Oil accounts 95 percent of Venezuela's export earnings, and plummeting world prices have helped push its state-led economy into a deep recession, with chronic shortages, empty store shelves and soaring inflation.

Opposition leaders took control of Congress in January for the first time in more than a decade and have been on a collision course with the socialist president ever since.

Lawmakers are weighing several options for removing Maduro from office, including shortening his term, and calling a constitutional referendum. But many fear the Supreme Court, which has not ruled against the executive branch since the late President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999, would simply overturn these efforts.

Opposition leaders quickly dismissed Wednesday's measures as insufficient to right the flagging economy.

Earlier in the day, the opposition's top vote-getter, two-time opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, called for a presidential recall referendum.

Maduro's approval ratings have languished in the 20 percent range for most of his term, but a recall battle would be complicated. To force a recall referendum, the opposition would need to gather nearly 4 million signatures. And if a referendum was held, the president would be removed only if the number of anti-Maduro votes exceeded the number of votes he got in the 2013 election.

A voter referendum might be a longer and more risky path than some of the other recall options, but Capriles said it was one the government would be forced to recognize.

""Now is the time,"" he said. ""They will not be able to overturn a referendum.""

(Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images)2015 Michael Kovac

Veteran civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, an avid supporter of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is accusing Bernie Sanders campaign staffers of preventing her from providing Spanish-language translation to voters who needed it at a Las Vegas caucus location during Saturdays Democratic primary.

Huerta, who co-founded the National Farmworkers Association with late Cesar Chavez in the 1960s, told Univision reporter Fernando Peinado: I dont feel that Sanders people respect our community. They stopped the people from having translation [services] in something as important as these caucuses that are taking place. They are showing that they dont respect us.

According to several reports, Huerta offered to help serve as an interpreter at the Harrahs Las Vegas Hotel and Casino caucus site because many caucus-goers were workers who spoke only Spanish.

However, when she got on stage, where the voting was taking place, many in the crowd started yelling No, no, no! She told Huffington Post that they were Sanders supporters and were also shouting English only.

That is completely against the spirit of everything that were working for, Huerta said. ""To deprive these voters at this crucial time of having a translation of what was going on  this is something they need in order to know what's taking place.""

She told ThinkProgress that a Sanders supporter went up on stage as well and she suggested we both translate. However, the moderator decided no translation would be used.

A video of the event - starting around the 54-min mark - shows the moderator asking if anyone speaks Spanish. When Huerta gets on stage, its difficult to make out the crowd is yelling -- yet No, No! is clearly heard.

The moderator asks the audience to stop shouting and says that other Spanish speakers in the crowd can point out if Huerta says anything that pro-Clinton. Eventually he decided were going forward in English only.

The room was divided with the Hillary people on one side and the Bernie people on the other, Huerta told ThinkProgress. It was really unfortunate, because there were many Spanish-speaking voters, the casino workers. We wanted to make it more comfortable for them, so they could know what was going on.

The 85-year-old clarified the exchange on Twitter.

I offered to translate & Bernie supporters chanted English only! We fought too long & hard to be silenced Si Se Puede! she tweeted.

The exchange went viral on Saturday night after actress America Ferrera, a vocal supporter of Clinton, also took to Twitter to speak out about the incident.

Symone Sanders, the campaign secretary for the Sanders campaign, told CNN that the senators campaign was about bringing people together.

""As the senator has said, this campaign is about bringing people together not dividing them,"" she said. ""We expect our supporters to be respectful of all people and don't condone anything otherwise.""

Actress Susan Sarandon, who is a Sanders support, disputed the accounts that a Sanders supporter yelled the English only remark.

@AmericaFerrera I was there. Nobody frm Bernie's side said English only. Moderator did when no neutral translator was found@DoloresHuerta, she wrote.

.@AmericaFerrera I was there. Nobody frm Bernie's side said English only. Moderator did when no neutral translator was found@DoloresHuerta  Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) February 21, 2016

This is not the first time Huerta has spoken out against Sanders. In an interview with Fox News Latino this week, Huerta said she was supporting Clinton because Sanders has not been progressive enough when it comes to immigration.

Bernie Sanders really hurt us on immigration reform, Huerta told FNL. In 2007 we had a great opportunity to get immigration reform passed. Sen. John McCain was at the table, Sen. Ted Kennedy was pushing that immigration reform bill and we could have gotten that bill out of the Senate and into the House and passed immigration reform.

Bernie Sanders came out against it, she said. He didnt call me. He didnt call all of us who have been working on immigration reform for the last 40 years. I dont know who he listened to, but that showed me he wasnt really paying attention.

Libya devolved into a failed state when NATO assisted Qaddafis radical jihadist opponents in killing him and then promptly abandoned the country. Left in the wake were two rival governments competing for power, which created space for Islamists to turn Libya into a cesspool of extremism.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to call the debacle American smart power at its best. Other presidential candidates still argue that it was the right thing to do.

How will the West ever learn anything if it cant identify its most obvious failures?

Libya has no central functioning government that can provide security for its citizens. ISIS fights to expand its caliphate along the Mediterranean to points as close as 200 miles from Europes vulnerable southern border. It controls Qaddafis hometown of Sirte. It has imposed Shariah law in the areas under its control. It exploits Libya as a base to export weapons, jihadists and ideology to Europe, other African countries and the Middle East.

Benghazi and Derna, which have long been hotbeds of radicalism, provided more fighters per capita to Afghanistan and Iraq than nearly any other area in the world. The difference between then and now is that Qaddafi kept the lid on the garbage can long before 2002-2003, when he became a reliable U.S. ally against radical Islam. He changed his behavior, gave up his nuclear weapons program, paid reparations to the victims of his atrocities and provided invaluable intelligence that disrupted numerous Islamist terror plots.

It represented a massive foreign policy success, and the U.S. thanked him by facilitating his murder.

Similarly, the West embraced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his struggles against Islamist forces, and then it threw him under the bus. Both Qaddafi and Mubarak did everything asked of them, but they ended up dead or in jail.

Any leader would really need to ask why he should trust NATO or the West. Is there any question why Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad does not negotiate an end to his countrys civil war and clings to Iran and Russia to keep him in power?

Iran cheated on its nuclear program for years. As a result, the U.S. gifted it with more than $100 billion  including $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars  and it hasnt changed its behavior in the slightest. In addition to its military ambitions, Iran will most assuredly spend the money on supporting Assad and its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, Africa and, yes, Europe.

Im amazed by some of the statements now coming from the coalition. The French defense minister is concerned about ISIS fighters blending in with refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Talk about restating the obvious. The British want troops to identify friendly militias in order to avoid targeting them in future airstrikes. Has something changed where we have improved the vetting of moderate militia groups?

NATO failed miserably in Libya and in Syria the first time around. Whats different now?

The only official who seems to make any sense is U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who said recently, The Libyans dont welcome outsiders intruding on their territory. He was referring to ISIS, but he might as well have been talking about the West. Libyans have not forgotten that NATO all but vanished once Qaddafi was killed.

Western foreign policy is in disarray. The scariest part is that supposed leaders dont even know it, and therefore they cant admit to previous mistakes. Allies that brought stability to the region are gone. Former and current antagonists benefited from Western incompetence.

Who would have predicted six years ago that those rulers battling Islamist terror would be deposed and that those committing it would become the Wests new friends?

NATO snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Libya. Refugees flood Europe. Terrorist attacks continue to spread geographically and in lethality. The Syrian civil war rages on. Iran lavishes its newfound wealth on its nuclear program and campaign of global terror.

Is it any wonder that citizens in Western countries are frustrated and angry with those in positions of authority?

Republican Pete Hoekstra is the Shillman senior fellow at the Investigative Project on Terrorism and the former chairman (R-Michigan) of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. He is the author of ""Architects of Disaster: The Destruction of Libya"" (The Calamo Press, October 2, 2015).","[]"

But during Saturday night's three-point loss against the Golden State Warriors, something odd happened when Jordan tried another one of his ferocious throw downs: The rim broke:

DeAndre Jordan broke the rim. https://t.co/LpkcdKcwj2  Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 21, 2016

This was remarkable, and led to Stephen Curry getting fouled on a three-pointer at the other end because Paul was more worried about stopping the game and getting the rim fixed than guarding his man:

Chris Paul tried to stop a Warriors possession by grabbing a ref and telling him the opposite rim was stuck.  Andy Bailey (@AndrewDBailey) February 21, 2016

Jordan has 160 dunks this season, which leads the NBA and is 40 more than Anthony Davis, who sits in second place. It's a humongous part of his game, and precisely why he currently leads the league in field goal percentage -- for the fourth year in a row.

Later, North Koreans official Korean Central News Agency hurled insults at South Korean President Park Geun-hye, calling her a tailless, old, insane bitch as it denounced her hardline response to the Norths recent long-range rocket launch and nuclear test.

South Korea shut down a factory park in North Korea that had been jointly run by the rivals. Seaoul also has started preparatory talks with the U.S. on deploying an advanced missile defense system in South Korea in attempts to tighten the screws on Pyongyang.

South Korean soldiers near the northwest island of Baengnyeong heard several explosions and also saw flashes from what the military believes were shells fired from North Korean coastal guns early Saturday morning, an unnamed South Korea Defense Ministry official told the Associated Press.

According to Reuters, Baengnyeong is a few miles from the disputed Northern Limit Line border and less than 12 miles from the North Korean shore.

Meanwhile, Seoul's Defense Ministry said Saturday that the military completed its search operations for debris from the North Korean long-range rocket that was launched into orbit Feb. 7.

The military said it was unlikely that there were any more crucial parts left to be found in South Korean seas. The ministry said that the navy recovered two pieces of debris presumed to be from the launch at an island off the country's western coast on Thursday and Friday.

South Korean officials believe the North deliberately blew up the rocket's first stage after burnout to prevent South Korea from retrieving debris.

North Korea said it launched an Earth observation satellite, but South Korea, the U.S. and the U.N. said it violated a ban on Pyongyang's missile technology.

Machado, who works for the state-run Brazilian Agricultural Research Company, said technology was being used to reduce the risk of contracting certain diseases.

As an example, he cited work on a bacteria present in soil that kills the larva of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue, Zika and chikungunya.

Officials are mobilizing to destroy mosquito-breeding spots in Brazil, one of the Latin American nations most affected by the spread of Zika, a virus suspected of being associated with a sharp increase in cases of babies born with abnormally small skulls, a condition known as microcephaly.

Biotechnology can achieve progress in agriculture and also in chemistry, industry and medicine, Machado said.

In the field of health, Machado noted transgenic soy plants that produce cyanovirin N, a protein being studied for the treatment of AIDS.

But along with choosing a provider and creating your birth plan, taking a tour of the hospital is one of the most important things you can do to ensure you and your baby will be healthy and safe.

Knowing the right questions to ask and what to look for can ensure that the hospital you choose is the best fit for you and your baby. Here are 10 to start with.

1. What level NICU do you have?

Each hospitals neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has designated levels of care, which are set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, its important that you deliver at a level III (subspecialty) NICU.

If you already know that your baby will require special services or will need surgery a few days after being born, for example, its a given that youll be at a hospital that has the appropriate medical team and services in place.

Even if your pregnancy is healthy however, you should make sure that if the hospital you plan to deliver in is a level I or level II NICU, they can still transfer your baby to a higher level NICU if necessary.

2. What amenities are available?

Its important to know what the hospital provides to help you manage labor. For example, youll want to know if they provide squatting bars and birthing balls or if youll need to bring your own.

You might also want to ask if you can bring in your own music or aromatherapy. Some hospitals also offer bathtubs for pain relief while others may only allow you to stand in the shower.

If youre planning to have a water birth, ask if birthing tubs are available, if you can arrange for one to be brought in or if you will need to give birth in a birthing center instead.

3. What type of fetal monitoring is available?

Once youre admitted into the hospital, your baby will be monitored for about 20 to 30 minutes. As long as youre OK, your baby doesnt show signs of distress, and you havent received any medication, you can walk around and have intermittent fetal monitoring until you deliver, said Michele Mayer, a certified nurse midwife at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. Your hospital may also offer portable fetal monitors, so be sure to ask.

4. Do you have doulas?

Studies show women who have doulas during pregnancy, labor and delivery are less likely to have interventions and cesarean sections. Plus, moms are more satisfied with their birthing experiences. Some hospitals offer doulas on staff while at others, you will need to hire an independent doula.

Although some hospitals will provide doulas if you decide to have one after youre admitted into the hospital, its a good idea to choose a doula beforehand so you can make sure you feel supported by her.

Its a relationship thats established during pregnancy, its not a last-minute decision, said Dr. Sherry Ross, an OB-GYN and womens health expert at Providence Saint Johns Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.

5. Can I eat?

If youre admitted into the hospital during early labor, your provider may allow you to eat something small. In fact, research presented at the American Society for Anesthesiologists last fall suggests that eating a light meal during labor is a good idea.

Once youre in active labor however, chances are you may not feel much like eating and you may even be nauseated.

Once youve received medication or an epidural you wont be allowed to eat, since theres a small chance you could aspirate food or liquid into your lungs if you have a cesarean section and need to be intubated, Ross said.

6. What are my pain relief options?

Its important to ask the hospital what your pain relief options are, including an epidural, analgesic medications, nitrous oxide, hydrotherapy or acupuncture, if there are any restrictions and if they will always be accessible.

7. Who can attend the birth?

If you wish to have more than one person in the delivery room, be sure to ask the hospital how many people are allowed to attend. Depending on the size of the room and the unique circumstances of your delivery, it may end up being a collaborative decision made between you, your partner and the doctors and nurses, Ross said.

8. Can we videotape the birth?

For legal reasons, its unlikely that the hospital will allow you to videotape. But once the baby is born, video, photos and FaceTime are probably OK.

9. Whats your security procedure?

After your baby is born, a security bracelet will be placed on your newborns ankle to protect him, but ask about other security measures the hospital takes as well.

10. Do you offer lactation consultants?

Breast-feeding may be natural, but it isnt always easy. In fact, more than 10 percent of women worry about learning how to breast-feed, according to a survey by Lansinoh.

One of the keys to success is to have support from the very beginning. So its a good idea to ask if youll have access to a lactation consultant on staff or if you should get a referral from an independent lactation consultant to come in.

Although your labor and delivery may not go exactly as you planned, knowledge is always power. Do your homework, keep an open mind and be flexible all things that will also serve you well when you become a mom!

The president who continues to claim that his mission is to help bridge partisan divide has once again gone out of his way to create more partisan divide.

President Obama's refusal to attend the funeral services of Justice Antonin Scalia has led to much speculation about his motives. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed that Mr. Obama is concerned about the level of security required for a presidential visit. With the vice president, Supreme Court justices and other high profile people already attending, it can be safely assumed that the security footprint will be fairly large regardless of whether the president attends or not. According to Earnest, some people actually want to use the funeral of the Supreme Court justice as some sort of political cudgel. All of a sudden, President Obama is concerned about politicizing an event? Hasnt his decision to not attend actually caused the controversy? So, what is the real reason why President Obama decided not to attend? It is somewhat political and extremely personal. At least, ideologically personal.



Supreme Court Justices are not often viewed as political foes, but Antonin Scalia was essentially Barack Obamas ideological nemesis -- an honorable man with absolute respect for the Constitution and the law of the land versus a lawless man with virtually no regard, if not complete disdain for, the Constitution. Barack Obama, it has to be assumed, simply does not want to honor a man that he considers a political and ideological enemy of left-wing progressivism. Especially a man who had the courage and integrity to stand up to those who sought to undermine the Constitution. Antonin Scalia was a threat to Barack Obama and the American left.



Have you ever wondered how a man in his mid-40s doesnt know that he cant throw a baseball and would embarrass himself in front of millions of people? Its because everyone around him tells him that he reminds them of Nolan Ryan. People dont develop narcissistic personalities unless they are constantly given what they want and told how great they are. President Obama is not used to being defied. He is not used to losing.

And even those who criticize him in public ultimately cave to his demands. Despite constant claims of obstructionism, the GOP-led Congress has basically given the president everything he has asked for. Even Chief Justice John Roberts wanted to score some points with President Obama and the left with his ObamaCare decision. Obama knows he can break Republican Congressional leaders. He now knows he can break John Roberts. But he knew he could never break Antonin Scalia.



As a lame duck, President Obama does not have much political motivation behind a decision like this. As he prepares to nominate someone to fill the vacancy in the court, we can assume that his choice will not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia. Perhaps he doesn't want to be seen celebrating the life and singing the praises of a man just before appointing the man's polar opposite as his replacement.



The truth is that Obama's decision is not political in the sense that he needs to worry about running for office again. But it is political in terms of how he envisions his legacy. And while ones legacy is important to most presidents, it is an obsession for Barack Obama.



Barack Obama is not seeking the approval of those who will view his legacy as an utter and complete failure anyway. He is seeking the approval of those who will ultimately define his legacy. Those with an equal level of scorn for Justice Scalia. The college professors who will re-write history and indoctrinate a new generation of radical progressive thinkers. Snubbing the memory of Antonin Scalia would be seen as a badge of honor by anyone who would consider Obama's legacy to be a successful one.



President Obama is often misunderstood by his critics. His abysmal record has led many to believe he is incompetent. As Marco Rubio correctly pointed out, nothing could be further from the truth. He knows exactly what he is doing. His countless hours on the golf course have led some to believe he is disinterested, carefree, perhaps even lazy. This is also a dangerous misconception. Indifference is not a personality trait of Obama. He is calculating, passionate and committed to his radical agenda. President Obama sought to fundamentally transform America and he has been quite successful thus far. With a lack of meaningful opposition in Congress, there are very few people standing in his way. There are very few people with the courage and conviction to actually defend the Constitution and push back against the president and his progressive vision. One of those people was Antonin Scalia.



Rest in peace, Justice Antonin Scalia","[]"

Phil Jackson may have had the opportunity to add real talent at the trade deadline, but the most appealing asset he had was the one (via ESPN's Ian Begley) that he refused to give up.

Jackson's firm rule at the trade deadline, per league sources, was that the Knicks hold on to their 2018 first-round pick.



It's unclear how frequently the Knicks were asked for the pick in the days leading up to the trade deadline, but what is clear is that it was off limits, according to league sources familiar with the club's thinking.



""Phil said that they weren't dealing it,"" was how one source put it.

Right about now is the time for Knicks fans to go ahead and rejoice.

New York reportedly looked at players like Jeff Teague and Ricky Rubio as potential trade targets, though it's unclear if that pick and a combination of lesser players would have been enough to pry either of those guys loose. But keeping the pick shows a change in the organizational philosophy, one that has a consistent track record of foolishly giving away picks as part of questionable deals in the past.

The reason that draft picks are so important in building a successful team is because they can translate into talented, productive players who are on inexpensive rookie scale contracts. If a team is smart in selecting the right players, this can be a huge advantage in that it leaves plenty of money under the salary cap to add more proven talent in free agency.

As we've seen in recent years, the combination of cap space and a large market is no longer desirable for star free agents all by itself. If a legitimate star is going to change teams, he wants to know that contending for a title is at least a possibility in his new situation. That's why it's so important to begin to build a real foundation, and it seems as though the man in charge in New York has finally convinced ownership to realize it.","[]"

Kerry said he spoke in the morning with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss terms of a ceasefire and the two now must reach out to the parties in the conflict.

""There is a stark choice for everybody here,"" Kerry said.

The Warriors were coming off a 32-point drubbing at Portland a night earlier that snapped their 11-game winning streak. They appeared highly motivated to erase that memory from the opening tip, shooting 56 percent in the first half and twice leading by 15 points in the second quarter.

Draymond Green had his NBA-leading 11th triple-double with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to help the defending champions improve to 49-5.

Jamal Crawford scored 25 points off the bench, Chris Paul added 24 and DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 21 rebounds for the Clippers. They fell to 19-6 without injured Blake Griffin. Their two earlier losses to the Warriors were by a combined 11 points with Griffin in the lineup.

The Clippers were coming off a 19-point win over San Antonio on Thursday night. Even with a day of rest, they played behind nearly the entire game.

Pablo Prigioni's 3-pointer left the Clippers trailing 115-112 with five seconds to go, long after both teams' best players had gone to the bench. That brought Thompson, Curry, Green Harrison Barnes back in a hurry.

Andre Iguodala's pass was stolen by C.J. Wilcox, but his panicked shot fell well short of the basket as time expired.

The Clippers again trailed by 15 early in the third when they briefly matched the Warriors basket-for-basket during a furious scoring stretch to close within five on a dunk by Jordan off Crawford's alley-oop pass. Jordan threw down some highlight dunks that had fans roaring and Crawford scored on a one-handed scoop shot, getting fouled as he crashed to the floor and making the free throw for the three-point play.

The Warriors' shooting percentage dipped -- barely -- to 50 percent in the third when Curry missed a few shots and got called for traveling. The Clippers' defense couldn't stifle them, either from the perimeter or inside. Curry hit a 3-pointer with Paul in his face, and Green caught an inbounds pass from Iguodala in traffic at the basket and scored.

Curry was fouled on a 3-pointer and made two of three before Green's layup kept the Warriors ahead 93-84 going into the fourth.

Golden State went up 14 points early in the fourth on consecutive baskets by Barnes and later stretched it to 18 points on a 7-0 run that included Barnes' second 3 of the quarter.

TIP-INS

Warriors: Green had a technical in the first quarter. ... The Warriors improved to 25-5 on the road. ... C Andrew Bogot sat out with a strained right Achilles. ... F James Michael McAdoo missed his 22nd straight game because of a sprained toe on his left foot. ... After Curry got fouled on a 3-pointer and missed one of his free throws, a fan shouted, ""Why don't you make everything?""

"411","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Pope Francis says contraception is acceptable to contain Zika epidemic","[]","As the Zika crisis continues to spread across the globe, Pope Francis suggested on Thursday that women threatened with the virus could use artificial contraception, adding that ""avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil.""

The pope unequivocally rejected abortion as a response to the crisis in remarks made Wednesday as he flew home after a five-day trip to Mexico.

But he drew a parallel to a decision by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s to approve giving nuns in Belgian Congo artificial contraception to prevent pregnancies because they were being systematically raped.

Abortion ""is an evil in and of itself, but it is not a religious evil at its root, no? It's a human evil,"" Francis told reporters. ""On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil. In certain cases, as in this one (Zika), such as the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear.""

Francis was responding to a reporter's question about whether abortion or birth control could be considered a ""lesser evil"" when confronting the Zika crisis in Brazil, where there has been a spike in babies born with abnormally small heads to Zika-infected mothers.

The World Health Organization has declared a worldwide health emergency over the Zika virus and its suspected link to birth defects. On Thursday, the U.N. agency advised the sexual partners of pregnant women to use condoms or abstain from sex if they live in or have visited Zika-affected areas, echoing a recommendation made by U.S. health officials. The virus has been reported in at least 34 countries, most of them in overwhelmingly Catholic Latin America and the Caribbean, where access to birth control is often limited and abortion is heavily restricted.

Theologians and some Latin American bishops cautioned the pope was not giving a green light for Catholics to use artificial birth control, nor did his remarks amount to a change in church teaching.

But Francis' comments suggest that Catholics under specific circumstances could make a ""conscience-based decision about whether they should prevent pregnancy,"" said the Rev. James Bretzke, a moral theologian at Boston College.

""Certainly Pope Francis should have anticipated a question on the church's response to the Zika virus, and from his answer I believe he was well-prepared to field this query,"" Bretzke said. ""His comment on the Zika virus and measures to avoid pregnancy is within perfect consistency with the traditional moral teaching of the Catholic Church.""

U.N. officials have called on Latin American countries to loosen their abortion laws to allow women to terminate pregnancies if they fear the fetus may be at risk for microcephaly, a rare birth defect that causes brain damage and may be linked to the virus.

But Francis told reporters, ""Taking one life to save another, that's what the Mafia does. It's a crime. It's an absolute evil.""

Several Latin American churchmen have reasserted the church's opposition to abortion and artificial contraception as more reports of Zika cases and brain-damaged babies emerged.

On Thursday, Bishop Noel Antonio Londono of the Diocese of Jerico in the Colombian state of Antioquia, said nobody should interpret the pope's remarks as free license to use birth control.

""This isn't a blank check,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly, with regards to Zika, there are people who need to protect themselves.""

Bishop Miguel Angel Cabello, of Concepcion, Paraguay, said it was too early to know exactly what Francis meant.

""We need more studies on the Zika virus and its consequences"" before any decisions on church policy are made, he said. ""The pope made a comment and we should take it as a comment.""

Francis has tended to downplay the fraught moral hand-wringing over sexual ethics that preoccupied his predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He has said the church shouldn't be ""obsessed"" with such issues.

Coming home from Africa last year, Francis dismissed a question about whether condoms could be used in the fight against AIDS, saying there were far more pressing issues in Africa, such as poverty and exploitation, and that only when those problems were resolved should questions about condoms and AIDS take center stage.

Angelica Rivas, of the Feminist Collective for Social Development in El Salvador, said the pope's latest remarks would not be much help since the church in her country has consistently opposed sex education on the use of contraception, and birth control would not help the many women who are already pregnant.

""We have to give them the alternative of interrupting the pregnancy,"" Rivas said.

In Ecuador, Jaime Pallares, a spokesman for the Mother Mary and Queen Catholic lay group, said that as a believer he follows the word of the pope. But on this issue, he personally differs.

""It's difficult for me to interpret the Holy Father's sentiment. From my perspective the best alternative would be to maintain some days of chastity,"" said Pallares. ""I'm not going to die of chastity.""

Cristiano Ronaldo scored a controversial header while looking clearly offside and Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas was outstanding for the visitors, but they are nine points off the pace being set by Barcelona.

Although Real took second place on goal-difference, Atletico had the opportunity to leap frog them later Sunday night when they were at home to Villarreal. Real hosts Atletico next Saturday in what now looks like being a battle for the runner-up spot in La Liga.

Malaga, sitting in mid-table, did a great deal of the running on a day when Zinedine Zidane's starting eleven lacked both Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez after their midweek UEFA Champions League work. With Gareth Bale still sidelined with the calf injury which has idled him for a month, the Real attack lacked its normal potency and the defense was sloppy at best.

Ronaldo spent much of the match starved of service and failed to convert a penalty kick on an afternoon when he was far from a force. The backline, absent the injured Pepe and suspended Raphael Varane, was too often split apart, lacking the necessary communication. Navas was the only reason Malaga didn't score a bundle.

Malaga should have been ahead before Ronaldo struck, but Anor Juanpi and Ricardo Horta both spurned chances while Navas denied two other opportunities. Juanpi profited from a giveaway to break in alone in the 19th minute but wound up scuffing his shot and not really testing the Madrid keeper. Two minutes later it was Juanpi's fine pass to the far post which gave Horta an open look; Horta's finish was poor, flashing past the near left post,

Real Madrid took the lead fortuitously in the 33rd minute when Cristiano had too much room to meet a Toni Kroos free kick from the right, managing to direct his header to the far left corner. Malaga supporters will be incensed when they see the replays since the Portuguese star was standing offside when Kroos struck his attempt, a step behind the defense creating the room he needed to open the account.

Two minutes later Ronaldo should have made it two when he was brought down by Welington only to see his penalty kick saved at the right post by a diving Carlos Kameni.

Malaga had one more golden opportunity before the break when Duje Cop got in clean on the left, but he elected to try to beat Navas from a tight angle when a simple pass to his right would have opened the door to two unmarked runners. Navas made the save off Cop, Sergio Ramos making sure by heading the looping rebound over the bar.

Navas was brilliant again five minutes into the second half when he reacted immediately to a Nacho deflection from a Horta shot and managed to one-hand a certain own-goal over his own bar to keep Real Madrid on top.

The deserved equalizer finally arrived in the 66th minute when Albentosa was left with acres of space at the far post to drive his shot into the near top corner after both Ramos and Marcelo were stranded by a Weligton cross through the box. Recio started the move on the left, spotting Weligton in position to make the cross through the disjointed Madrid backline.

Navas kept his team even with another fine save, this a touch-over to a Charles header with 15 minutes left as the chances continued to flow in Malaga's direction.","[]"

But authorities still cannot say what may have prompted 45 -year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County, who has no criminal record, to randomly prey on victims who had no connection to him.

""How do go and tell the families of these victims that they weren't targeted for any reason other than they were there to be a target,"" Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said during a Sunday morning news conference.

Dalton was arrested early Sunday in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt after the shootings began early Saturday evening. Getting said Dalton, who is being held at the county jail, is expected to be arraigned Monday afternoon in a Kalamazoo County courtroom, where he likely will face multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder.

Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. outside the Meadows Apartment complex in Richland Township, on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County, where a woman was shot multiple times and seriously wounded. Authorities said she is expected to survive.

A little more than four hours later and 15 miles away, a father and his 18-year-old son were fatally shot while looking at cars at the dealership. Fifteen minutes after that, five people  including the teenage girl who police originally said had been killed, based on a pronouncement by medical officials  were gunned down in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant along Interstate 94, Matyas said.

Police said Sunday morning the injured teen remained in serious condition.

Matyas said authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

Dalton was arrested in a neighborhood about 12:40 a.m. after a deputy spotted his vehicle driving through downtown Kalamazoo after he left a bar parking lot, authorities said. Matyas said Dalton did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and a semi-automatic handgun was discovered in his car. Matyas declined to disclose anything else police may have found in the vehicle.

""We had no problem with him,"" Matyas said of Dalton's apprehension. ""In this particular case, we're just thankful it ended the way it did  before he could really kill anybody else.""

Authorities said Dalton was in contact with more than one people during the ongoing rampage but would not elaborate about what kind of communication that involved. Prosecutors said they do not believe anyone else will be charged.

""There's no common denominator with any of these,"" Matyas said, before detailing each shooting. ""This person was just waiting in the parking lot of the apartment complex. The one at ... the dealership, they were looking at cars. The ones at Cracker Barrel, they were just sitting in their cars. ""There is absolutely no common denominator ... through race, age, anything.""

Matyas declined to offer a possible motive. Getting said authorities are interviewing Dalton and reviewing his phone. He said they do not know if the handgun belonged to Dalton or was registered to him.

""This is every community's nightmare  when you have someone going around just randomly killing people, no rhyme, no reason,"" Matyas said. ""Obviously, we're going to interview the individual and we're hoping to gather ... what he was thinking, what type of methodology he used, if any, in these killings.""

Getting was flanked by several law enforcement officials during Sunday morning's news conference, some of whom wiped tear-filled eyes or who had to momentarily stop speaking after becoming choked up. Following the news conference, Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell and Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley embraced.

""It's hard to put into words the impact something like this has,"" Getting said. ""How do we put an end to the fear this is causing? There's this sense of loss, there's this anger, there's fear. There's all these emotions.""

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.","[]"

The outcome of Saturdays contests helps both 2016 front-runners regain their footing after going one-for-two in the leadoff contests. But there are potential hurdles ahead.

The big question now looming over the GOP race is: With Jeb Bush suspending his campaign on the heels of a distant finish Saturday, where will his supporters go?

At his victory rally, Trump challenged pundits who say such votes will gravitate to his rivals. The billionaire businessman sounded a booming note of confidence as he previewed the race ahead.

Lets put this thing away, Trump told cheering supporters.

Reflecting on the rough-and-tumble primary, which gave him a 10-point margin of victory, Trump also said, When you win, its beautiful. 

Clinton heads into the next round in a more fragile  albeit improved  position.

Clinton has watched her lead in national polls essentially evaporate after losing big in New Hampshire. Her showing in Nevada marks a crucial victory, and she enjoys a significant advantage heading into next weekends South Carolina primary.

I am so, so thrilled and so grateful to all of my supporters, Clinton said at her Las Vegas victory rally.

But her 5-point margin of victory may not be enough, at this stage, to significantly blunt Sanders momentum. The Vermont senator maintained he has an excellent chance to score some big wins in the upcoming Super Tuesday contests.

The Palmetto State, meanwhile, delivered a huge victory Saturday night on the Republican side to Trump -- while Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were locked in a tight race for second.

Cruz nevertheless gave a fiery speech to supporters, as the senator touted his campaigns ability to defy expectations and maintained that hes the best candidate to go up against Clinton or Sanders or whatever other socialist they nominate on the Democratic side.

Indeed, the screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up, Cruz said, while suggesting hes the only candidate who can beat Trump.

Rubio, for his part, declared: After tonight, this has become a three-person race, and we will win the nomination.

Rubio was in need of a recovery after stumbling in New Hampshire following a rough debate performance earlier this month. He had vowed to bounce back, and was buoyed in South Carolina by support from the state's popular governor, Nikki Haley, and other state leaders.

With Bush now out of the race, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only governor left standing on the GOP side. It remains unclear where his supporters will go. The only other candidate left is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who vowed to press on.

The GOP race heads next to Nevada and after that to Super Tuesday, representing a delegate gold mine. Even South Carolina, with 50 delegates, is the most valuable GOP primary to date. As the winner, Trump would get the lion's share.

South Carolina, historically, also is a prized contest for Republican candidates as it has a knack for picking the eventual nominee  the primary winner has gone on to claim the nomination in every race since 1980, except for 2012 when Newt Gingrich won.

The race tightened in the final days, but not enough to shake Trump's long-time advantage there. Fox News exit polls indicate significant numbers of late-deciding voters ended up supporting Cruz and Rubio, causing both candidates to perform more strongly than pre-election polling suggested.

Clintons Nevada win comes just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.","[]"

The 25-year-old actress explains why she's decided to take a year off from acting in a new interview with author and activist bell hooks for Paper magazine.

""I'm taking a year away from acting to focus on two things, really. My own personal development is one,"" Watson says. ""My own personal task is to read a book a week, and also to read a book a month as part of my book club. I'm doing a huge amount of reading and study just on my own.""

WATCH: Emma Watson Delivers Another Inspiration Speech on Gender Equality

""I almost thought about going and doing a year of gender studies, then I realized that I was learning so much by being on the ground and just speaking with people and doing my reading,"" she continues. ""I actually wanted to keep on the path that I'm on. I'm reading a lot this year, and I want to do a lot of listening.""

It's no secret that advocating for gender equality is a passion of Watson's. She was appointed to the role of U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador in 2014, and launched the HeForShe initiative, which advocates for total equality without the use of negative rhetoric and for getting men to join the political and social battle.

""I want to listen to as many different women in the world as I can,"" Watson tells hooks. ""That's something that I've been doing on my own, through the U.N., the HeForShe campaign, and my work generally.""

However, Watson does admit to being sensitive to how her activism is being perceived.

""When I was talking to my mom about going and doing the gender studies, she was like, 'It feels like you'd be trying to prove to everyone that you're smart and trying to prove something by doing that. You're learning so much on your own at the moment and enjoying it so much. You can prove that you care about it by spending time listening and talking to as many people as you can and keep doing what you're doing,'"" she shares. ""I do feel like I have to overcompensate at times.""

She said her involvement in feminist studies has also led to a big positive change within herself: Being much less self-critical.

""I'm on my journey with this and it might change, but I can tell you that what is really liberating and empowering me through being involved in feminism is that, for me, the biggest liberation has been that so much of the self-critiquing is gone,"" she says. ""So much energy and time -- even in subtle ways -- I'm 25 now and I've certainly come a long way from where I was in my early 20s. Engaging with feminism, there is this kind of bubble now that goes off in my head where these really negative thoughts about myself hit, where I'm able to combat them in a very rational and quick way. I can see it now in a way that's different.""

""I see so many women struggling with issues of self-esteem,"" she adds. ""They know and they hear it and they read it in magazines and books all the time that self-love is really important, but it's really hard to actually do.""

Jason Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper. Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations, police said.

A Michigan prosecutor said authorities were investigating a Facebook post that indicated Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he was aware of the post, but was not prepared to discuss it.

Dalton lived just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.

Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said investigators contacted Dalton's wife Saturday evening ""to make sure she wasn't a victim."" Hadley added that she's cooperated with police in their investigation.

Law enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt.

Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

He described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where the woman was shot and seriously wounded.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said.

Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree incomprehensible, according to Fox 17 Online.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.

Collaborating with artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner, LaBeouf invited small groups of people to participate by hanging out with the trio inside the elevator at the Oxford Union, a debating society near the famed university that has hosted Albert Einstein, Anna Wintour and Mother Teresa.

Part of the democratic nature of the performance the trio are exploring is this very odd social feel of who goes in the elevator, how many people can fit inside, how long do you spend in there, explained Jack Lennard, a spokesperson for the Union. Part of the art project in itself is there is no real set time limit or set amount of people who can go in at any one time.

Visitors to LaBeoufs project  which ended at 9 a.m. Saturday  didn't go too far. When the doors closed, the elevator that normally serves two floors remained stationary until one of the artists chooses to let in the next group.

It's hard to keep things intimate and exciting when you're in a long-term, monogamous relationship. You're comfortable. There's no real need to go out of your way to impress each other anymore. You might have even let your bedroom activity become stale and predictable. But there is good news: A new study says that if you start adding some variety to your sex life, you'll be just as sexually satisfied as you were during the first six months of your relationship.

The study is one of the largest ever to examine what contributes to a satisfying sex life long-term, reports The Chicago Tribune. It looked at 38,747 married or cohabitating heterosexual couples who had been together three or more years, ranging in age from 18 to 65.

Many of the couples had been together for two decades or more. ""If properly nurtured, passion can last for decades,"" the study states. ""Nearly two-thirds of sexually satisfied respondents reported that their sex lives now were as passionate as in their early days together. Over one-third of sexually satisfied men and women selected 'passionate' as the single best word (out of six) to describe their most recent sexual encounter.""

And what is the common thread for satisfied couples? It was the willingness to try new things. According to the study, nearly half of all satisfied and dissatisfied couples read sexual self-help books and articles, ""But what set sexually satisfied couples apart was that they actually tried some of the ideas,"" said lead author David Frederick, assistant professor in health psychology at Chapman University.

The satisfied men and women were more likely than the dissatisfied to say that yes, they spiced things up from time to time by doing things like trying a new position, acting out a sexual fantasy, or using sex toys. The data also revealed that sexually satisfied men and women gave and received more oral sex, had more consistent orgasms, and and engaged in more frequent sex.

To all of these findings we say: Duh.

The Chicago Tribune reported that the lawsuit quotes a 2013 EPA study that found elevated lead in homes drinking water after city construction disrupted lead service lines and they failed to warn residents about the risk.

The EPA report warned that Chicagos attempts to upgrade the citys water system might pose health risks from toxic metal poisoning. The Guardian reported that city officials have scrutinized the report, saying that the citys water is safe from lead contamination.

While we have not yet reviewed the lawsuit, Chicagos water is safe and exceeds federal, state and industry standards. The department of water management provides the cleanest, best tasting water possible; aggressive programs that protect our water supply from lead and thorough testing methods allow us to continually achieve this goal, a spokesman for the Chicago department of water management told The Guardian.

The lawsuit alleges that the citys negligent and reckless conduct caused a heightened risk to residents. Three plaintiffs named in the lawsuit want Chicago officials to pay for testing as well, according to The Guardian.

The suit filed in Cook County Circuit court represents a heightened fear of lead contamination stemming from the crisis in Flint, Mich. Michigan officials exposed thousands to lead contamination after not being able to maintain the citys water system. Officials have opted to use chemicals to flush out the lead instead of replacing all of the citys pipes.

Chicago has struggled replacing lead pipes around its city after the U.S. banned the use of lead service lines in 1986, according to The Tribune. Almost 80 percent of the city receives drinking water from lead pipes.

Federal regulations state that 50 homes are to be tested for lead every three years in Chicago. The rules require utilities to check only the first liter of water drawn in the morning, according to The Tribune. However, the EPA report found that lead can still end up in drinking water after the first water has been drawn.

The debate over whether New Zealand should take Australia's unwanted asylum seekers comes amid an uproar over what will happen to 267 asylum seekers who are expected to be transferred from Australia to the Pacific atoll of Nauru. The issue of their fate was raised amid annual talks between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his visiting New Zealand counterpart John Key.

Australia refuses to allow any asylum seekers who try to reach the country's shores by boat to ever settle in Australia, and sends them instead to detention camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has virtually stopped asylum seekers from the Middle East and Asia attempting to reach Australia on rickety boats.

The 267 asylum seekers came from Nauru's detention camp to Australia for medical treatment or to support a relative who needed treatment. They refused to return to Nauru pending an Australian High Court challenge to the legality of Australia's refugee policy, but the court recently ruled against them, leaving them at risk of deportation.

The court decision sparked outrage among refugee advocates, two of whom climbed to the top of a 160-meter (500-foot) tower in Melbourne on Friday to unfurl a banner with the Twitter hashtag LetThemStay.

Key's government reached an agreement in 2013 with Australia to resettle 150 refugees a year from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. On Friday, Key said the offer still stands, provided the asylum seekers meet New Zealand's character requirements and are genuine refugees.

""So I can't tell you who might or might not be able to come, or whether the Australian government would want to exercise the right to do that,"" Key told reporters in a joint press conference with Turnbull. ""All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table.""

But Turnbull appeared to dismiss the offer, saying the government didn't want to give people smugglers ""marketing opportunities"" to recruit asylum seekers to embark on the dangerous journey.

""We take into account what John has proposed ... but we do so very thoughtfully, recognizing that the one thing we must not do is give an inch to the people smugglers,"" Turnbull told reporters.","[]"

The rebuilt golden dome of the al-Askari shrine rises above the low, brown skyline of Samarra, but down below a maze of blast walls and checkpoints manned by Shiite militiamen separate pilgrims from the city's mostly Sunni residents. The IS group's lightning advance across northern and western Iraq in 2014 stalled just outside Samarra, though the front lines are now some 30 kilometers (20 miles) away.

Many believe IS would have never emerged if al-Qaida in Iraq -- a precursor of the extremist group -- had not blown up the shrine in the early hours of Feb. 22, 2006, shattering its golden dome and setting off a two-year wave of reprisal attacks.

Shiite lawmaker Muwaffak al-Rubaie, who was then Iraq's national security adviser, remembers the call he got from a local security official that morning. ""He said today is the day of judgment,"" al-Rubaie recalled. ""He was absolutely right.""

In the days that followed, hundreds of Sunni mosques were attacked and thousands of civilians were killed. As Sunni extremists carried out near-daily suicide bombings, Shiite militiamen raided Sunni neighborhoods, abducting young men, torturing and killing them, and dumping the bodies in the streets.

In 2006 alone, the United Nations estimated that more than 34,000 civilians had been killed across Iraq. The following year, the government withheld casualty figures from the U.N., fearing they would be used to paint a ""grim"" picture of the country and undermine security efforts.

Baghdad's once-mixed neighborhoods were carved into Sunni and Shiite enclaves that soon came to be surrounded by high concrete walls and concertina wire. In a country where mixed marriages were once common, merely having a Sunni or Shiite first name was enough to be disappeared at one of innumerable flying checkpoints.

Iraqi security forces backed by a surge of tens of thousands of U.S. troops were eventually able to halt the bloodletting by 2008, but the country has never been the same.

""The wounds that were created then have healed, but with permanent scars,"" al-Rubaie said.

The lingering animosity can be seen in the shadow of the rebuilt shrine, where Sunni residents who once prided themselves on being its guardians now live under a permanent security lockdown. Streets that once thronged with pilgrims are empty, and shops that catered to them are shuttered.

Saad Eskander, an Iraqi historian and former director of the National Archives, said that as the only Shiite shrine located in a Sunni-majority city, the site was a symbol of coexistence for centuries. A Shiite Muslim, he remembers praying there alongside Sunnis as a child.

But he says that in the aftermath of the 2006 attack, politicians exploited popular anger for their own ends. Years of sectarian politics paved the way for the emergence of IS, and led many Sunnis in Iraq to initially welcome the extremists as liberators.

""Daesh is a result of those sad events,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.

""Before 2006, the divisions in Iraq were between the political representatives of the two communities,"" Eskander said. ""Now the divisions are between the two communities themselves.""

Thousands of pilgrims still visit the shrine every day, but they are channeled through a labyrinth of walls that separate them from Sunni neighborhoods. Sunni residents must pass through checkpoints manned by Shiite militiamen, who took over security after Iraq's army and police crumbled in the face of the IS advance.

Aruba, a 30-year-old Sunni woman who works in a pharmacy, said her parents used to regularly visit the nearby shrine before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, and recalls going there herself as recently as 2005. But she doesn't know of a single Sunni resident who has been since 2006.

""They don't respect that this is where I come from,"" Aruba said of the forces guarding the shrine. ""They search me in my own home."" She asked that her last name not be published out of concern for her safety.

""This place belongs to us,"" said Abdul Rahman Salah, a customer at the pharmacy. ""The shrine's Imam was our grandfather.""

The shrine is the final resting place of the 10th and 11th imams, religious figures from the 9th century who most Shiites believe inherited the mantle of leadership from the Prophet Mohammed. The adjacent mosque is built on the site where the 12th imam, who most Shiites believe will return as a messiah-like figure, disappeared more than 1,000 years ago. Millions of pilgrims visit every year.

Salah said that before 2006, Samarra residents looked after the shrine and handled security, even worshipping alongside the mostly Shiite visitors. But after the February attack, the militias moved into the area and brought Shiites from neighboring villages to maintain the grounds.

In the following years, while money poured in to rebuild the shrine, the local economy withered as pilgrims no longer ventured out into the city.

""I don't even want to look at that site anymore,"" Aruba said. She said she views it as a symbol of the Shiite-led government's neglect of Sunni communities.

Naji Sayad, a member of the so-called Peace Brigades, the Shiite militia that guards the site, acknowledges that the city seethes with resentment.

""Honestly, they don't want us here, they say take your shrine and just leave,"" he said. ""The people of Samarra, they used to survive on the people who visited the shrine... But because they attacked it in 2006, this doesn't belong to them anymore.""

He won't be the only one with a shot to win.

Over the course of 10 days in Daytona, the teams have sorted themselves out between who is fast and who isn't.

Following are five drivers not named Earnhardt who can win the Daytona 500 and five who probably won't.

Five who can win:

Denny Hamlin -- All of the Joe Gibbs Racing Toyotas are very, very fast. But Hamlin might be the best restrictor-plate racer of the bunch.

Joey Logano -- The defending Daytona 500 winner has finished second in all three of his Speedweeks races this year.

Kyle Busch -- The 2015 Sprint Cup champion has a ton of talent, a ton of confidence and a ton of speed in his car.

Ryan Blaney -- All through Speedweeks, Blaney has been near the top of the speed charts in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford.

Kevin Harvick -- Although he's been kind of quiet so far in Speedweeks, Harvick is almost always a threat to win.

Five who probably won't win:

Michael Waltrip -- The two-time Daytona 500 winner will race in a back-up car and his primary car had no speed in it.

Clint Bowyer -- Like a lot of other veterans, Bowyer has struggled to find speed so far in his first outing with HScott Motorsports.

Brian Vickers -- Expecting Vickers to win in his first points race in nearly a year might be unrealistic.

Ryan Newman -- As a group, the Richard Childress Racing Chevrolets have lacked the performance of the Hendrick Motorsports and Stewart-Haas Racing Chevys.

Martin Truex Jr. -- In both the Sprint Unlimited and his Can-Am Duel, Truex got wrecked on the last lap. Not a good omen for today.","[]"

Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday, Fox News projects, beating Bernie Sanders and breathing new life into her campaign just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

Though the victory appears to be a narrow one, Clinton is hoping the win will serve to undercut Sanders' momentum as they head next into several delegate-heavy contests.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.

With 66 percent of precincts reporting in Nevada, Clinton has 52 percent to Sanders' 48 percent.

The balloting in Nevada coincides with the Republican primary Saturday in South Carolina, where front-runner Donald Trump is hoping for a decisive win.

In Nevada, Clinton was looking to rebound after losing big to Sanders in the party's New Hampshire primary, and only narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses.

The candidates spent their final hours before the caucuses furiously trying to drive up turnout among their supporters.

Significant spending by Sanders on paid media and staff helped his campaign make inroads into the Latino and African-American communities, which make up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate in the state.

It wasn't enough to edge out Clinton. But each candidate benefited from a different set of constituencies.","[]"

And as the Miami Marlins' new manager, he's the one enforcing the rule.

The Marlins allowed players to have beards the past two years, but that changed under an organizational policy adopted after Mattingly was hired.

""Initially not too many guys were happy about it,"" said reliever Mike Dunn, who shaved off his goatee before reporting to spring training. ""You can fight it, or you don't. Obviously I shaved, so it's OK.""

Mattingly said he didn't care whether players were allowed to have beards, goatees or mustaches, but supported the new rule.

""Guys will whine,"" Mattingly said Sunday. ""Some guys like it, some guys won't. As long as we're consistent, I think it's not that big of a deal.""

But it's new for Mattingly. The Dodgers allowed facial hair when Mattingly was their manager for five seasons, and he wore a mustache when he was an All-Star first baseman for the Yankees.

In 1991 he was benched for refusing to cut his hair, and says his complaint was that the rule was not being enforced equitably among everyone on the Yankees.

""It wasn't really that complicated,"" he said.

Many Marlins sported facial hair last season. Among the players who have had to give up their beard is 23-year-old ace Jose Fernandez, who shaved after he reported to camp.

""I'm afraid I'm going to look 16,"" he said with a smile. ""But it's not a big deal. Whatever the rules are, we're going to follow them.""

Libya devolved into a failed state when NATO assisted Qaddafis radical jihadist opponents in killing him and then promptly abandoned the country. Left in the wake were two rival governments competing for power, which created space for Islamists to turn Libya into a cesspool of extremism.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to call the debacle American smart power at its best. Other presidential candidates still argue that it was the right thing to do.

How will the West ever learn anything if it cant identify its most obvious failures?

Libya has no central functioning government that can provide security for its citizens. ISIS fights to expand its caliphate along the Mediterranean to points as close as 200 miles from Europes vulnerable southern border. It controls Qaddafis hometown of Sirte. It has imposed Shariah law in the areas under its control. It exploits Libya as a base to export weapons, jihadists and ideology to Europe, other African countries and the Middle East.

Benghazi and Derna, which have long been hotbeds of radicalism, provided more fighters per capita to Afghanistan and Iraq than nearly any other area in the world. The difference between then and now is that Qaddafi kept the lid on the garbage can long before 2002-2003, when he became a reliable U.S. ally against radical Islam. He changed his behavior, gave up his nuclear weapons program, paid reparations to the victims of his atrocities and provided invaluable intelligence that disrupted numerous Islamist terror plots.

It represented a massive foreign policy success, and the U.S. thanked him by facilitating his murder.

Similarly, the West embraced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his struggles against Islamist forces, and then it threw him under the bus. Both Qaddafi and Mubarak did everything asked of them, but they ended up dead or in jail.

Any leader would really need to ask why he should trust NATO or the West. Is there any question why Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad does not negotiate an end to his countrys civil war and clings to Iran and Russia to keep him in power?

Iran cheated on its nuclear program for years. As a result, the U.S. gifted it with more than $100 billion  including $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars  and it hasnt changed its behavior in the slightest. In addition to its military ambitions, Iran will most assuredly spend the money on supporting Assad and its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, Africa and, yes, Europe.

Im amazed by some of the statements now coming from the coalition. The French defense minister is concerned about ISIS fighters blending in with refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Talk about restating the obvious. The British want troops to identify friendly militias in order to avoid targeting them in future airstrikes. Has something changed where we have improved the vetting of moderate militia groups?

NATO failed miserably in Libya and in Syria the first time around. Whats different now?

The only official who seems to make any sense is U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who said recently, The Libyans dont welcome outsiders intruding on their territory. He was referring to ISIS, but he might as well have been talking about the West. Libyans have not forgotten that NATO all but vanished once Qaddafi was killed.

Western foreign policy is in disarray. The scariest part is that supposed leaders dont even know it, and therefore they cant admit to previous mistakes. Allies that brought stability to the region are gone. Former and current antagonists benefited from Western incompetence.

Who would have predicted six years ago that those rulers battling Islamist terror would be deposed and that those committing it would become the Wests new friends?

NATO snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Libya. Refugees flood Europe. Terrorist attacks continue to spread geographically and in lethality. The Syrian civil war rages on. Iran lavishes its newfound wealth on its nuclear program and campaign of global terror.

Is it any wonder that citizens in Western countries are frustrated and angry with those in positions of authority?

Equally important, the data suggests the Fed might still keep in place its plan to normalize U.S. monetary policy by continuing to raise interest rates through 2016 and beyond despite recent headwinds caused by fears of a global slowdown.

It remains to be seen whether the January numbers represent a trend or a blip, as some economists believe.

In terms of overall inflation, the wildcard is energy prices: If the price of oil continues to hover at its lowest level in decades, overall inflation will remain stubbornly weak.

Energy prices are down 6.5% from a year ago with the 29% year-over-year drop in gasoline prices imposing a significant drag on headline CPI inflation, analysts at research firm Oxford Economics said in a research note.

The Oxford Economics analysts added that despite to positive January data, it would be wrong to assume the energy drag is completely behind us as it will likely linger through 2016. As such, headline CPI inflation will likely fall back below 1% year-over-year by mid-year.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

The January figures were boosted by rising housing and medical costs, helping to lift core inflation the most in four and a half years.

In the 12 months through January, the core CPI rose 2.2%, adding to gains made in December when the CPI increased 2.1%. Economists had forecast core CPI up 0.2% last month and increasing 2.1% from a year ago.

Both the January and December CPI numbers support the Feds contention that a strengthening labor market will lift wages and eventually push consumer prices higher. A certain amount of inflation is a sign of a healthy economy in that it reflects rising wages due to a tight labor market.

But weak wage growth has been an Achilles heel of the U.S. economic recovery in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. workers havent seen significant increases in hourly wages even as monthly job creation has been healthy and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9%, half the level it reached during the worst of the economic downturn.

Wages began to show signs of life late last year and those numbers are now being reflected in CPI numbers.

Last month, the rental index rose 0.3% after a similar gain in December. Medical care costs rose 0.5%, with prices for prescription drugs also increasing 0.5%. The cost of doctor visits edged up 0.1% after falling 0.2% in December. Hospital costs increased 0.4%.

Apparel prices rose 0.6% after falling for four straight months. The increase in apparel is noteworthy because retailers have been offering deep discounts to unload surplus inventory. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3%.

The front-running Trump won 33 percent of the vote in the Republican South Carolina primary, roughly 11 percent ahead of challengers Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Ted Cruz, of Texas.

The win is Trumps second in the first three, early-state contests and now focuses the debate on whether any the five remaining candidates can stop him, in part by taking the support for Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign after a disappointing fourth-place finish on Saturday in South Carolina.

I guess you can always be stopped, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I have very good competition. ... They are very talented people.

In his South Carolina victory speech, Trump said, Lets put this thing away.

To be sure, Trump appears to be in a good position. Every Republican presidential candidate who has won New Hampshire and South Carolina has taken the party nomination. And he appears to have strong support in the Deep South as the primary season swings into the region next month.

Trump notably held a rally this summer in Mobile, Ala., that attracted an estimated 30,000 people.

Rubio and Cruz remain confident they can eventually get more votes as the GOP field continues to narrow, then overtake Trump.

The eventual winner will face either Democrat Bernie Sanders or front-runner Hillary Clinton, who on Saturday night won her partys Nevada caucus over Sanders 53-to-47 percent.

She defeated Sanders in Iowa, but lost to him in New Hampshire.

Rubio told Fox News Sunday that he has a real sense of optimism after South Carolina. However, Rubio said he is not trying to get other candidates, specifically Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished fifth in South Carolina, to drop out, which could give Rubio even more of the establishment vote now that Bush is out.

The sooner we coalesce, the better we can do as a party, he said. Its going to happen one way or another.

Cruz told ABCs This Week that Trump is a formidable candidate but polls show a majority of voters dont think he can beat Clinton.

You cannot come from him at the left, Cruz said of his primary strategy. You have to have a true conservative to win.

But his influences  his homeland of Ethiopia, his childhood in Sweden, his adopted home of Harlem in New York City  were anything but typical, and they created the wide array of flavors that inspire his cuisine.

Adopted as a young boy by a Swedish family after his mother died of tuberculosis, the 45-year-old Samuelsson says he developed his love for food while watching his grandmother, Helga, make her famous roasted chicken, pan-fried herring and black bread.

He says his greatest influences are ""from just living  growing up, what me and family and my grandmother ate, but also when I started to travel.""

Hes had quite a vantage point. After training in Europe he was drawn to New York, and at 24 he became the youngest chef to receive a three-star review from the New York Times for his restaurant, Aquavit. He soon became a household name with stints on shows like ""Top Chef Masters"" (which he won), ""The Next Iron Chef,"" ""Chopped"" and later ABC's ""The Taste.""

In 2010 he moved to Harlem, where he opened Red Rooster and, more recently, Streetbird. He says his food has found its home in the diversity of his neighborhood.

""You think about Harlem,"" he says, and ""it's really a community that is based on post-migration and also immigration. So when I look at Streetbird and Red Rooster's menus, they are both reflections of migration and immigration. That's why we can have tacos and fried yardbird (a type of fried chicken seasoned with Ethiopian spices) on the menu.""

The success of those restaurants allowed him to dig deeper into his community by hosting an event called Harlem EatUp, a four-day festival that celebrates the neighborhood's food and culture and brings in chefs from all over the country. His 2012 memoir, Yes Chef, helped instill him as a household name, and now he's opening restaurants not just in the U.S., but also in Bermuda.

Hes got a lot on his plate, but Samuelsson says his love of food and his dedication to his adopted home will keep him moving forward.

""Keep dreaming,"" he says. ""You never know how your story is going to be told, and food is a way for me to communicate my passion for my community, but also my passion for food.""","[]"

The video, shown at Decembers Paris climate change conference, shows Koko use sign language to say things like I am gorilla, I am flowers, animals, I am nature... Man Koko love... but man... man stupid... Koko cry, time hurry, fix Earth...

The video was produced by a French environmental group and the gorilla Foundation, which cares for Koko the gorilla and notes on its website that the video was produced with a script and edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.

Animal communication experts say the video is misleading.

This group has been really upping the ante for making incredible exaggerated claims for her comprehension, Barbara King, an anthropology professor at the College of William and Mary and the author of How Animals Grieve, told FoxNews.com.

King also worries that the ad, by exposing the idea of ape communication to ridicule, could undermine views about primates abilities.

Related: Scientist who urged government to sue climate skeptics gets millions from taxpayers

Koko is fabulous as she is. No one has to exaggerate. Scientists who do that -- it hurts our credibility. It really does.

Although primates like gorillas can learn hundreds of words, there is no good evidence that they can learn grammar, according to Arizona State University Psychology Professor Clive Wynne.

That includes even the simplest grammar like word order, for instance the difference between dog bites man and man bites dog.

Related: Climate change brings needed rain to Africa

On tests to distinguish terms like those, even one of the worlds smartest apes got the right answer 57 percent of the time  barely better than guessing. And that involved overly-generous grading by the trainers, Wynne notes.

But while primates havent been able to learn grammar, they can do impressive things once thought impossible.

Koko shows definite comprehension of spoken English, King said. Koko knows an impressive 2,000 words and uses them to make requests and respond to questions.

Related: NYU faculty senate recommends ending fossil fuel investments

Koko can also come up with some pretty creative ways of putting two phrases together, King noted. For example, Koko didnt know the word for ring and reportedly combined two words she knew  finger and bracelet  to make her meaning clear.

Primates also show human-like grief, King said.

There was one gorilla whose long-term mate and friend died in the zoo, and he first tried to revive her, even bringing her favorite food to her and putting it in her hand and poking her, she said.

And then at some point he seemed to come to a really stunning realization that his friend was not going to move. I dont know if thats a concept of death, but his behavior changed and he let out a very agonizing wail and stopped trying to revive her. Clearly something cognitive and emotional happened to him at that moment.

But animal experts agree that climate change is way beyond the understanding of gorillas.

A complex phenomenon like climate change is not understood by many humans, let alone an ape, Sally Boysen, an Ohio State University psychology professor, told FoxNews.com.

Even if Koko could understand climate change, experts disagree about the effect of climate change on primates. Warming has nearly paused over the last 17 years, and increases in the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere have increased plant growth.

However, Gorillas are threatened by other environmental harms, which have reduced the number of gorillas to just around 100,000. The main causes are slash-and-burn methods to clear African forests for agriculture, killings by hunters, and development in their habitats.

That has left some subspecies like Mountain Gorillas critically endangered with under 1,000 individuals left.

But while primates face serious environmental challenges and have impressive mental abilities compared to other animals, its still best not to get global warming advice from a gorilla.

Plesiosaurs, giant marine reptiles that lived during the dinosaur age, likely propelled themselves forward underwater by flapping their two front flippers, much like penguins do today, the researchers said. The paleo-giants probably didn't rely much on their back flippers for propulsion, as that movement would've only marginally increased their speed, computer simulations showed.

""This is the first time plesiosaur locomotion has been simulated with computers, so our study provides exciting new information on how these unusual extinct animals may have swum,"" said study co-author Adam Smith, a curator of natural sciences at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham Natural History Museum in the United Kingdom. [Photos: Uncovering One of the Largest Plesiosaurs on Record]

The study began when Jie Tan, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, began creating computer models and simulations that captured the movements of modern animals. After designing virtual simulations of moving frogs, turtles, eels and manta rays, Tan turned to imaginary creatures. But he wanted another challenge, so he chose an extinct beast for his next project, said study senior author Greg Turk, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech.

Plesiosaur locomotion has puzzled scientists since the reptiles were first discovered in 1824, because there aren't any modern animals that look like them. Even marine turtles, which have two large front flippers, are no match, because unlike plesiosaurs, turtles have tiny back flippers.""I did some poking around and found that plesiosaurs have this weird body plan,"" Turk said. ""There isn't any agreement in the paleontology literature about how they swam.""

To investigate, the team of computer scientists and paleontologists built a computer model based on Meyerasaurus victor, an 11-foot-long (3.4 meters) plesiosaur discovered in a Lower Jurassic formation in Germany. The scientists placed pivot points on the model's legs wherever the real-life M. victor had joints, but they kept the model's neck and tail rigid, Turk said.

""We weren't looking for what contribution the tail motion had,"" Turk told Live Science. ""There are hints that some plesiosaurs might have had a little bit of a tail fin, but that's not something we looked into.""

The researchers ran about 2,000 simulations to identify the most efficient way the plesiosaur could have swum. In the end, they found that if plesiosaurs flapped their front flippers up and down, the animals could have efficiently propelled themselves forward with every up and down stroke.

""Plesiosaurs flew underwater using their winglike flippers,"" Smith said. ""The front flippers were the powerhouse providing most of the thrust, while the rear flippers provided less thrust and may have been used for stability and steering instead.""

This technique, if accurate, clearly worked for plesiosaurs; the reptiles reigned as marine apex predators for 135 million years, until the asteroid event wiped them out some 66 million years ago, the researchers said.

The study was published online Dec. 17 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.

A third certainty in our country used to be strong leadership from the individual in the Oval Office. Abraham Lincoln, F.D.R, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and many others have used their position as our commander in chief to exude Americas strength on the world stage and promote our nations unique exceptionalism.

However, on several recent big issues, President Obama has not taken the challenging, but necessary step up to the plate to demonstrate why America needs to lead in the world. His actions instead seem to suggest that we can lead from behind, which goes against everything that our country has stood for in the past.

The best example of this is President Obamas utter failure to address the danger that ISIS presents to the United States. Their sickening attacks in Paris are still fresh in our mind, but it is important to note that just hours before the terrorists attacked the city, President Obama said that ISIS was contained and on the run.

Following the attacks, instead of stepping forward and adopting an aggressive strategy to take the fight to ISIS, the president deferred and continued to give off the impression that our current strategy to combat radical Islamic terrorism is working. His response showed that he is either delusional to the real threat ISIS presents our nation or he is simply incapable of providing authentic leadership for the sake of the country and the globe.

For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

Then last week, following the devastating tragedy in San Bernardino, President Obama immediately leapt to blame gun laws and Republicans, when in fact the attacks appear to have been perpetrated by ISIS sympathizers. The fact that the President would try to score political points instead of committing to once-and-for-all going after Americas greatest threat is emblematic of his entire presidency, putting politics and party before country and leadership.

While it seems President Obama has already checked out on his White House responsibilities and is looking forward to writing his memoirs and building his library, the absence of American leadership has now become a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election.

On one side, there are Republican candidates who all know and understand that America must operate from a position of strength, and adhere to the ideas espoused by Ronald Reagan about leadership and action. They will all say what needs to be said, do what needs to be done, and lead when the world needs to be led.

On the other side, there is Hillary Clinton, President Obamas former Secretary of State and the architect of his disastrous foreign policy agenda who also jumped at the chance last week to put political points on the board, instead of promoting a strong strategy to defeat ISIS. Secretary Clintons lack of understanding about ISIS was crystal clear at the most recent Democratic debate, when she said that the fight against ISIS cannot be an American fight.

Secretary Clinton, it must be an American fight. For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

For the past seven years, we have seen what it looks like when America doesnt take charge, but instead sits in the backseat as a global observer. As a result, our country is less safe, less secure, and people have a rational fear of another heinous act of terrorism coming to our shores.

Instead of electing someone such as Hillary Clinton, who outlined President Obamas global agenda and agrees with his worldview, we need to elect a president that understands the importance of American leadership, and will reassert our nation as the leading force for good in the world.

Rex: 'Welsh Dragon' may be earliest Jurassic dinosaur","[]","Two brothers hunting for ichthyosaur fossils along the coast of the United Kingdom came across something far more astounding: The bones of what may be the earliest known dinosaur from the Jurassic period in the U.K., and possibly even the world, a new study finds.

After finding the bones in 2014, Rob Hanigan contacted his brother, Nick. The two scoured the coast, located just south of Wales, for more of the fossils, taking careful geological notes along the way.

Later, they reached out to paleontologists at the University of Portsmouth, who confirmed that the bones belonged to a theropod, a group of mostly meat-eating dinosaurs. Moreover, the paleo-beast lived at a key point of dinosaur diversification at the beginning of the Jurassic, said study co-author Steven Vidovic, a doctoral researcher of paleontology at the University of Portsmouth.

""It's a jumbled mix of bones that are a real puzzle to put back together,"" Vidovic told Live Science in an email. ""It was very rewarding reconstructing it.""

The researchers named the newfound species Dracoraptor hanigani, which roughly translates to ""dragon raptor."" (The dragon is the national symbol of Wales.) It also honors Nick and Rob Hanigan for the find and for donating the specimen to the ""Amgueddfa Cymru""  National Museum of Wales.

During its lifetime, about 201 million years ago, D. hanigani likely hunted or scavenged meat with its tiny, pointy teeth that measured less than 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) long. However, its teeth weren't yet full size. A bone analysis suggests that D. hanigani was likely a juvenile, largely because most of its bones had not yet fully formed or fused together, the researchers said.

Given its young age, D. hanigani was a shrimp compared with other theropods. Though its distant relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, stood up to 13 feet (4 meters) tall and measured up to 40 feet (12.3 m) long, D. hanigani stood only about 2.3 feet (70 centimeters) tall and measured about 6.5 feet (200 cm) long.

The newfound dinosaur also sported a long tail, possibly to help with balance, the researchers said.

Little is known about dinosaurs during the earliest days of the Jurassic period, Vidovic added. ""This is some of the very best fossil evidence that we have for this time,"" he said.

There are earlier dinosaur fossils dating to the Triassic period (between 251 million and 199 million years ago) in the United Kingdom. But the timing of this early Jurassic skeleton is important: The end-Triassic extinction led to the demise of more than 75 percent of all marine and land life, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. This extinction event, which wiped out so many others, likely helped dinosaurs diversify and multiply, Vidovic said.

""About 200 million years later, the [newfound] dinosaur looks a little generic, but at the time in the early Jurassic, it was quite new and different,"" Vidovic said. ""So the reason it might look a bit generic in hindsight is that loads of later dinosaurs repeated the winning formula.""

The study was published online today (Jan. 20) in the journal PLOS ONE.

"461","foxnews","2016-02-21 00:00:00","Lightning-Hurricanes Preview","[]","Carolina just cooled off one of hockey's top road teams, further growing its reputation as a tough home team to handle.

The Hurricanes will try to extend their season-best home winning streak Sunday night against Tampa Bay, but the Lightning have dominated this series recently and been a 5-on-5 force over their own mini-streak.

After a 5-2 win over streaking San Jose on Friday, the Hurricanes (27-22-10) are heading into the second of a three-game homestand seeking a fourth consecutive home win. They've gone 9-1-3 at home since the Christmas break, outscoring opponents by an average of 3.23 to 1.85 with a 93.1 percent penalty kill.

""It's a big time of year,"" Jeff Skinner told the team's official website. ""Every game you come to the rink, those two points are big. Even tonight, playing a Western Conference team, those two points are just as important as when we're playing anyone else in the league. It's a good win. Those guys are a good team over there, a good road team. It's big to get those two points, especially at this time of year.""

Skinner scored twice and Jordan Staal scored for a third straight game while adding an assist to give him 22 points in 19 games after managing 15 through his first 40.

Eric Staal's goal-scoring drought reached 15 games, but he at least notched an assist to end a seven-game span without a point.

""This is a fun time of year to be involved and to be playing,"" Eric Staal said. ""We're in the mix. We've put ourselves in that (position) and we've got to fight, we've got to win and we've got to pick up points every night.""

That's been the case for nearly two months with Cam Ward in goal. Carolina's No. 1 hasn't lost in regulation since Dec. 29, going 6-0-4 with a 1.90 goals-against average and .930 save percentage since the calendar flipped to 2016.

""He's our guy,"" coach Bill Peters said. ""We have a lot of confidence in (Ward and Eddie Lack), but we're going to ride a guy, and it will be Cam.""

Ward, however, has been peppered by Tampa Bay for more than six years now, going 6-10-2 with a 3.43 GAA and .895 save percentage, including four straight regulation losses. Among the 18 teams he's faced at least 10 times in his career, his 3.00 GAA versus the Lightning is the highest.

One of those losses came Nov. 1 as Tampa Bay (31-22-4) opened the season series with a 4-3 win in Carolina as part of a 10-2-0 span against the Hurricanes.

The Lightning are coming off Saturday's 4-2 win in Pittsburgh following a 6-5 shootout victory over Winnipeg, and they outscored those teams 9-3 at even strength.

""I didn't think we gave them a whole lot,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. ""When we did give them something, it was either we were on a power play or it was 4-on-4. But other than that, I thought 5-on-5 we played pretty steady. We got the lead. We played D. That was pretty much it.""

With that, however, comes a 0-for-10 power play as part of a 1-for-24 span, as well as two short-handed goals allowed in the last two games. The power play has been even worse on the road with one conversion in 41 chances dating to Dec. 6.

Individually, Steven Stamkos has scored in consecutive contests to get to 300 career goals, one of which came in November against Ward.

Tampa Bay's Ben Bishop is 5-1-0 with a 1.67 GAA and .950 save percentage in his career against Carolina.","[]"

The performance-art project, which was announced Tuesday by his art collective, LaBeouf, Ronkko & Turner, will highlight more than 15 years of his work, including some of his earliest and most iconic roles, such as Louis Stevens in The Even Stevens Movie and Stanley in Holes.

And out-of-towners need not worry  because the egotistical event, dubbed #AllMyMovies, is also being live-streamed on the projects Web site, NewHive.

LIVESTREAM: WATCH LABEOUF WATCH LABEOUF

The film fest kicked off Tuesday at noon with a showing of LaBeoufs latest film, Man Down. The next movies up were Fury, Nymphomaniac volumes 1 and 2, Charlie Countryman, The Company You Keep and Lawless.

Sporting a thick beard and wearing a simple black T-shirt, LaBeouf was spied by The Post sitting in the fifth row of the theater in an aisle seat.

At one point during the showing of Nymphomaniac: Volume 2, he burst out laughing during the infamous restaurant scene, in which LaBeoufs dinner date graphically uses spoons in a sexual manner.

Its unlike anything that Ive experienced prior to this, getting to see how the actor reacts to his own films, said Djordje Gasic as he walked out of the Angelika Film Center. And it was rather interesting to see him and imagine whats going through his mind  seeing himself on the big screen.

The movie theater, which can seat up to 78 people, was packed throughout the day and there was a line of about 50-70 people waiting outside to get in.

I think its a little psychotic that [LaBeouf] is watching his own movies nonstop for a few days, said Emmeline Bone, a 24-year-old Bushwick resident who was waiting to go inside.

Isabel Bathencourt, a film student at NYU, had a more academic take.

It seems kind of silly, [but] Im trying to take it at face value, she explained. It is actually somewhat of an interesting idea to force yourself to watch yourself be other people for three days straight. But I think its also easily turned into kind of a spectacle.

Although the police department did not annouce what is on the video, an ESPN source said it shows an encounter between Manziel, his ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley and a valet at the Hotel ZaZa in Dallas. According to an affadavit for a protection order, Crowley said that after arguing with Manziel in his hotel room, the Cleveland Browns quarterback led her down a back stairwell to the valet.

Crowley allegedly told the valet that she was ""scared for her life,"" but the valet said that he didn't know what to do. At which point, Manziel threw her into the passenger seat of the car and they drove away.

Crowley says that Manziel hit her and then threatened to commit suicide while they were en route to Fort Worth.

Police spokesman Maj. Midge Boyle said Saturday that investigators have reviewed medical records provided by Crowley and that they could conclude their domestic violence investigation by next week.

Manziel hasn't been charged, but a judge did issue Crowley a protection order against him.

Police haven't interviewed Manziel, but spoke to several other witnesses. Boyle says police want to have their strongest case against Manziel before speaking to him.

Some defense lawyers have questioned whether Manziel is getting special treatment and another suspect facing similar allegations might already have been arrested. Boyle said the detective investigating the allegations ""hasn't gotten all the facts yet.""

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","[]"

The Wake Forest head coach has had his Lawrence, KS, home on the market for almost two years. The five-bedroom, seven-bath abode is now listed for $1.95 million.

So what does the house of an ex-NBA player look like? Big, big, big. At 7,800 square feet, there's plenty of room to stretch out. The spacious residence includes multiple entertaining areas, a gourmet kitchen, a sun room, and an office.

You can live out your hoop dreams by shooting baskets where Manning did, in the indoor sports court. Outside, there's also a pool and outdoor living space.

""This is an impressive, custom-built home with unique amenities and fine finishes, in one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in northeast Kansas,"" says listing agent John Esau. ""It is priced considerably under what it would cost to build today, and we're still looking for a qualified buyer who sees the incredible value and will enjoy the home as much as the Mannings.""

If you're a big fan, you could even choose to keep the furnishings he left behind, which are available at a negotiated price. (We're not sure if those cool jerseys in the bedroom are part of the deal, but hey, you could always ask.)

While Manning has left Kansas for his coaching job in North Carolina, he'll always have roots in the plains. A living legend in Lawrence, the forward led the Jayhawks to the national championship in 1988.","[]"

I am Nurse Ratched. I can change dressings and deal with Noreen's gallbladder drain. Giving shots are my specialty, so look out.

Pain control is important. Nor has pain from three sources: 1.) gallbladder, 2.) ribs, requiring Neupogen injections to enable her bone marrow create more red blood cells to fight infection (her No. 3 source of pain).

It's all about ""fighting,"" and Noreen is the champion in my book.

Because Noreen's markers have increased, with the gallbladder and the ribs happening at the same time, her doctors have decided to stop the chemo (this is the drug which Noreen and her Foundation have backed financially, and for which she has made four trips to Washington DC lobbying the FDA which ended a ""WIN"" with the drug being fast-tracked by the FDA for use by patients with advanced metastatic disease).



Noreen is disappointed in the turn of events and we are waiting for the doctors to come up with a new strategy. She hates to be confined to bed. Nurse Ratched is tough, and I am getting her to walk a little each day.

Prince Turki al-Faial's comments come as the kingdom hosts an 18-day military exercise with 20 members of the new alliance, which includes Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan and neighboring Gulf states. Defense Ministers from the coalition of Muslim-majority countries are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Saudi Arabia sometime in March.

""I consider this a leading and commendable step that should have happened sooner and thank God it has taken place,"" he told reporters in Abu Dhabi.

""It's no secret, unfortunately, that in our world today the majority of terrorism-related acts, its victims are Muslim,"" he said. ""Therefore, it is our responsibility as Muslim countries to play the primary role in fighting this disease that has impacted us all.""

Notably absent from the coalition is the kingdom's regional rival Iran, as well as Syria and Iraq, which are battling to win back swaths of territory controlled by the Islamic State group.

Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shiite-majority Iran are fiercely divided on a host of issues and support opposite sides of the wars in Yemen and Syria.

Relations worsened after the execution of a popular Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia last month, which triggered protests in Iran and the ransacking of the Saudi Embassy and another diplomatic mission there. The two countries then severed diplomatic and trade ties.

Prince Turki said ""the ball is in the Iranian court"" when it comes to any hope of improving ties.

""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expressed publicly that Iran's interference in the affairs of Arab states is a situation that is unacceptable,"" he said.

The prince, who does not hold an official position in the government, is an influential and outspoken member of the Saudi royal family. He headed Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate for more than two decades until Sept. 1, 2001, and held ambassador posts to the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland.","[]"

Despite being one of the countries most heavily affected by Zika, which is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito along with dengue fever and Chikungunya, Brazil has so far not required doctors or hospitals to report new Zika cases and thus no reliable statistics have been compiled for the outbreak of disease.

The South American giant has only reported weekly statistics on microcephaly cases, the birth defect which has affected a rising number of newborns and has been linked to Zika in pregnant women.

According to a bulletin released on Wednesday, in Brazil since last October 5,280 possible cases of babies with microcephaly or changes to their nervous systems have been registered, of which 508 cases have been confirmed.

Health authorities have ruled out microcephaly in 837 of the reported cases and are investigating the situation in 3,935 other patients suspected of suffering from the defect.

Now, however, suspected cases of Zika in pregnant women, as well as possible deaths from the disease, must be reported to authorities within 24 hours.

Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro said that the regulation also requires that microcephaly cases, which already must be reported, must be tallied separately from other congenital birth defects.

The minister said that he met with U.S. officials to discuss cooperating on - within one year - developing a vaccine against the virus and therapy to treat people who contract Zika.

The Brazilian government declared a health emergency last year over the Zika outbreak and its possible association with microcephaly. EFE

Most Christians know enough about the Bible to be dangerous.

The Bible in America is a massive industry ($2.5 billion) yet it is the best seller few read and fewer understand.

The Bible has become a moving target. One can strip it down, twist it, misread it, add to it, supplement it, and even overrule it, and, unfortunately, 95 percent of the congregation will not realize it.

Why? Because Americans no longer know the Bible. The evidence is overpowering that contemporary Christianity is Bible-ish, at best, and at worst, in some cases, Bible-less.

The American Bible Society releases an annual State of the Bible report and their research is persuasive in understanding the declining influence of the Bible in America.

Everyone has an opinion about the Bible. Politicians attempt to use the Bible, Grammy-award winners quote it and Hollywood has portrayed it on the big screen.

Yet one problem remains: most are oblivious to the Bibles basic content, meaning, and message.

Across the pond, the results are even more dramatic: one-third of British parents thought Harry Potter was a thematic plotline derived from the Bible.

The Bible is not held in the esteem it once was. Over the last 150 years, America has drifted from its Biblical focus. In an election season, it is remarkable to recall that, though he was not a member of any church, the Bible was valued as an authority in America so much so that Abraham Lincoln quoted from it four strategic times in his second inaugural address on March 4, 1865. President Lincoln used words ascribed to Jesus in Matthew 18:7 and  using the Bible --- pronounced Gods judgment on our nation for her moral bankruptcy of slavery.

The unwillingness of many Americans to dig deeper into the Scriptures is not related to a lack of options. The Gideons give away a Bible every second. One publisher sells more than sixty different editions of the Bible.

Clearly, the challenge of biblical illiteracy in America is not because of a shortage of Bibles, but rather knowledge and appreciation of the Bibles message.

The Bible is a diverse love story. Actually, it is the greatest break-up-and-get-back together story the world has ever known.

The message of the Bible is that even though we are not what we should be, God loves us, redeems us, and has a purpose for our lives.

A tremendously exciting new initiative is underway to re-introduce the world to the Bible.

In 2017 the six-floor 430,000-square-foot Museum of the Bible will open only two blocks from the National Mall in Washington D.C. The Museum of the Bible invites all people  those with faith and those without  to engage with the Bible in an immersive experience with its unique history, narrative and influence.

Once one encounters the story of the Bibles history and preservation, the cost that was involved  and it was a terrible cost  one can never again open the Scriptures with the same detached, careless attitude.

The story of how the Bible has come to us is a tale of heroism, courage, persecution, betrayal and towering faith in a God who raises the dead, mixed through the centuries with the blood of martyrs. If 80 percent of Americans believe the Bible is Gods word, shouldnt we show the Bible some respect by knowing more about it?

Still, Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State captured a major terror stronghold in the country's northeast. Talal Sillo, spokesman for the Syria Democratic Forces, says their forces captured the town of Shaddadeh after sunset Friday, and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights corroborated his report.

Sillo told The Associated Press by telephone that ""we have fully liberated Shaddadeh"" adding that the next step is to remove booby traps and explosives left behind by extremists. He also said Turkish troops were bombing border areas Friday, killing civilians.

A U.N. special envoy said there was no way he ""realistically"" could get all parties to return to the bargaining table by Feb. 25 as he had hoped. ""We intend to do so soon,"" Staffan de Mistura told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.

Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday discussions with Russia have been ""constructive,"" adding, ""there is certainly a lot more work to do.""

The planned ""cessation of hostilities,"" negotiated by the United States, Russia and other countries, does not include groups that the United Nations has designated as terrorists, according to Foreign Policy. Airstrikes targeting groups such as the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front and ISIS were expected to continue.

Meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ""deeply alarmed' by the situation in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo where intensified fighting has forced 70,000 people to flee their homes and left many without water or electricity.

ICRC says two hospitals hit earlier this week in Aleppo are now out of service. They had provided thousands of consultations, surgeries and delivered hundreds of babies per month. The Red Cross also says that the hospitals which are still standing are struggling to function.

Also on Friday, Russia's President Vladimir Putin discussed the Syrian crisis in a telephone call with Saudi King Salman.

The Kremlin said Putin and the king ""expressed interest in settling the Syrian crisis and ensuring stability and security in the entire region of the Middle East and North Africa."" Putin also reaffirmed his invitation for the king to visit Russia at a time that would be convenient for him.

The state-run Saudi Press Agency simply said that ""diplomatic relations were discussed in addition to the review of the latest developments in the region.""

Moscow and Shiite power Iran back embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Sunni-ruled kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported Assad's foes throughout the five-year conflict and says it is ready to send ground forces into the country.

The World Food Program said Friday that it hopes aid deliveries to besieged areas of Syria were ""not a one-off"" convoy and will continue, as the UN agency prepares an airdrop to reach 200,000 in a city surrounded by ISIS.

WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher made the comments a day after the UN announced 114 trucks had delivered life-saving supplies over the previous 24 hours for 80,000 people in five besieged areas of Syria.

She said the WFP is preparing a ""high-altitude"" airdrop into the city of Deir el-Zour, whose residents are being besieged by ISIS fighters, in coordination with Syrian Arab Red Crescent operatives on the ground.

Luescher said Friday that ""a WFP registered company"" with experience in airdrops was expected to leave from as as-yet-undetermined country in the region.

The report shows 2015 surpassed the global growth rate as it set new arrival and spending records, though there are grave concerns that the virus could put a dent in those numbers in 2016.

Nearly 29 million people visited the region last year, a 7 percent jump that surpassed the 4 percent global tourism growth rate, said Hugh Riley, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization. Visitors to the Caribbean spent $30 billion last year, a $1 billion increase from 2014, he said.

""It's important for us to celebrate our victories in the Caribbean. We have our challenges,"" Riley said in a phone interview.

He credited a stronger U.S. economy, new flights, lower oil prices and persistent marketing.

U.S. travelers accounted for 14.3 million visits, representing roughly 50 percent of all arrivals. Barbados, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago reported the highest growth rates in U.S. arrivals. Meanwhile, there were more than 5 million arrivals from Europe for the first time in seven years, more than 1 million from Britain alone.

Hotel occupancies and average daily rates also increased last year for most hotels, although one-third of hotels reported a net loss as they struggled with high operating and air travel costs, said Frank Comito, CEO of the Florida-based Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association.

""While most destinations have done well and most hotels did well, that's not been the case across the board,"" he said. ""There have been some areas of slow growth and even no growth.""

The news comes as the Caribbean and Latin America struggle with an increase in Zika cases, with Puerto Rico already reporting several wedding and business conference cancellations. The U.S. territory has more than 30 confirmed Zika cases. The virus has hit Martinique and French Guiana the hardest, with more than 2,500 potential cases and more than 100 confirmed ones.

Comito said there have been some cancellations of trips to the Caribbean but declined to provide a specific number.

But officials said they expect tourist arrivals to increase roughly 5 percent this year.

worlds biggest ocean-dwelling crocodile buried on the edge of the Sahara, a creature that was twice the size of anything seen today.

Named Machimosaurus rex, this croc would have weighed in at

least 6,600 pounds and been around 32 feet long. Other than its size, it would have looked much like a modern day crocodile except for its narrow snout  which was designed to allow it swim in the ocean.

It would have been the top predator in what was then an

This is an incredibly big crocodile. It is twice as big as

a present day marine crocodile, University of Bolognas Federico Fanti, who was part of the team that made the discovery with support from the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration, told FoxNews.com.

The skull itself is as big I am, said Fanti, whose

discovery was detailed in a study in the journal Cretaceous Research. Just the skull is more than five feet long.

Its a massive crocodile.

Tunisia, where the skeleton and some bones were found, would have been a

lagoon facing the ocean and the environment would have been filled with huge fish and turtles  all favorite prey of the Machimosaurus rex.

This animal, however, used to feast on the large turtles or

big fishes that it found in the ocean, Fanti said. He was so big and so powerful that it was absolutely at the top of the food chain.

Beyond its size, Fanti said the significance of the find is

what it tells us about a mass extinction event that is believed to have happened between the Jurassic and Cretaceous period about 150 million years ago. Machimosaurus

rex was thought to have died out then but the discovery suggests the extinction event was not as widespread as some paleontologist thought.

Related: 20-Foot Fanged, Galloping Ancient Croc Fossils Found

The fact that Machimosaurus rex (pertaining to a group that

was well alive in the Jurassic) lived 130-120 million years ago indicate that there was no mass extinction, Fanti said.

Everyone thought this group of crocodiles went extinct in

the Jurassic but we found it well into the Cretaceous, he said. We simply extended the temporal range of the animals. Twenty million years is a lot of time.

Fanti, whose team has discovered 20 new species including a rebbachisaurid sauropod Tataouinea hannibalis in the same area, said there is less to learn about crocodile evolution from this new discovery. The reason, he said, is that crocodiles have changed little over time.

Basically, they are bigger or smaller, he said of their

evolution, adding that even bigger crocodiles lived on land, many of which also have gone extinct. The largest freshwater crocodile, Sarcosuchus imperator, lived 110 million years ago and grew as long as 40 feet (12 meters). It weighed

up to 17,500 pounds, according to National Geographic.","[]"

Jackie Collins Estate Is on the Market For $30M in Beverly Hills","[]","As a writer of 32 novels over her illustrious career, the late Jackie Collins obviously had an eye for detail. And she applied that same precision to the construction of her 21,784-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion.

Now on the market for $30 million, the eight-bedroom home includes five writing desks used by the author whose works included ""Hollywood Wives,"" which became a television mini-series in 1985.

The home has a two-story gallery entrance with a dramatic staircase, a 100-foot art gallery connecting to a guest apartment, a gym, a screening room, and a chef's kitchen with three islands.

Its master suite includes a living room, an office, his-and-her baths, massive walk-in closets and balconies with views of the Hollywood Hills.

Collins did most of her writing in two of the home's studies, one off her bedroom and the other next to the gym, she told the Wall Street Journal in 2014.

""My house in Beverly Hills was inspired by a David Hockney painting,"" Collins told the WSJ. ""In 1989, my husband, Oscar [Lerman], and I visited an art gallery in London, where we saw Mr. Hockney's 'A Bigger Splash.' I couldn't take my eyes off the pool and fell in love with the clean lines, suspended splash and overall tranquillity.

Jason Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper. Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations, police said.

A Michigan prosecutor said authorities were investigating a Facebook post that indicated Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he was aware of the post, but was not prepared to discuss it.

Dalton lived just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.

Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said investigators contacted Dalton's wife Saturday evening ""to make sure she wasn't a victim."" Hadley added that she's cooperated with police in their investigation.

Law enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt.

Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

He described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where the woman was shot and seriously wounded.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said.

Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree incomprehensible, according to Fox 17 Online.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.

A pair of NASA astronauts released a capsule loaded with 1.5 tons of trash Friday as the space station soared over Bolivia. The capsule should re-enter the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly over the Pacific on Saturday.

NASA supplier Orbital ATK launched the capsule to the space station in December, full of food, clothes and other goods. The astronauts removed the precious contents, then filled it with garbage and old equipment for incineration.

Commander Scott Kelly and Timothy Kopra, the Americans on board, sent computer commands to set the Cygnus free. The stunning 250-mile-high view showed the capsule slowly backing away, its two circular solar wings looking like open umbrellas.

Kelly, who's less than two weeks from wrapping up an unprecedented yearlong mission for NASA, thanked everyone who worked on the Cygnus  ""this great vehicle.""

""It's been a pleasure,"" he noted.

""A beautiful release,"" replied Mission Control.

Virginia-based Orbital ATK plans to launch another Cygnus with more supplies from Cape Canaveral, Florida, late next month. The flight was delayed a few weeks after black mold contaminated some of the cargo bags. Technicians had to disinfect everything.

SpaceX, meanwhile, another commercial cargo carrier for NASA, is aiming to make a delivery in the next few months. The company is working to get back on track following a launch accident last summer.

NASA has handed off space station shipments to private business so it can focus on getting astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit, namely to Mars. It hopes to do the same with space station crews next year. For now, U.S. astronauts are hitching rides with the Russians.","[]"

Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center CEO Allen Stefanek said the hackers demanded a ransom of 40 bitcoins, currently worth $16,664. The FBI is investigating the attack, which began on Feb. 5.

Authorities said this kind of attack is called ransomware, where hackers encrypt a computer networks data to hold it hostage, providing a digital decryption key to unlock it for a price.

""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,"" Stefanek said. ""In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.""

It was unclear if anyone had recommended the hospital pay off the hackers. Law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times the ransom was paid before authorities were called to help.

The hospital said it alerted authorities on Monday and was able to restore its network by Monday with the help of technology experts, according to the Los Angeles Times. Stefanek said patient care was never compromised, nor were any hospital records.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency is investigating the attack, but couldnt provide any further details. Neither authorities nor the hospital have an idea who is behind the attack.

Computer security experts normally recommend people not pay the ransom, though at times law enforcement agencies suggest they do, said Adam Kujawa, Head of Malware Intelligence for Malwarebytes, a San Jose-based company that recently released anti-ransomware software.

It's difficult to know how many victims pay the ransom, because many who do don't reveal it.

""Unfortunately, a lot of companies don't tell anybody if they had fallen victim to ransomware and especially if they have paid the criminals,"" Kujawa said, ""but I know from the experiences I hear about from various industry professionals that it's a pretty common practice to just hand over the cash.""

Bitcoins, the online currency that is hard to trace, is becoming the preferred way for hackers collect a ransom, FBI Special Agent Thomas Grasso, who is part of the government's efforts to fight malicious software including ransomware, told The Associated Press last year.

During 2013, the number of attacks each month rose from 100,000 in January to 600,000 in December, according to a 2014 report by Symantec, the maker of antivirus software.

A report from Intel Corp.'s McAfee Labs released in November said the number of ransomware attacks is expected to grow even more in 2016 because of increased sophistication in the software used to do it.

The company estimates that on average, 3 percent of users with infected machines pay a ransom. It's not clear how many of those users were individuals and how many companies. Some ransomware attacks go unreported because the victims don't want it publicized they were hacked.

The 434-bed hospital in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles was founded in 1924. It was sold to CHA Medical Center of South Korea in 2004. It offers a range of services including emergency care, maternity services, cancer care, physical therapy, and specialized operations such as fetal and orthopedic surgeries.

Schultz isn't known to be shy about his political views.

Rumors surfaced last year that he was considering a campaign for the White House. He put an end to the speculation with an op-ed in the New York Times last August announcing that he wouldn't run.





Schultz had landed in hot water earlier in the year after he encouraged baristas to talk about race relations with customers and write ""race together"" on the coffee chain's cups.

The campaign suffered a public backlash from the start, with critics accusing the company of using racial tension to sell coffee. The vitriol was so strong that it caused a senior Starbucks executive to temporarily suspend his Twitter account.

The company eventually abandoned the campaign.

Schultz acknowledged his critics in his remarks to employees last week, saying, ""I have been criticized because people say 'Well role is to create shareholder value and profits, not to use Starbucks as a political tool.'""

But he said he can't sit quiet through this election.

""I worry if we just continue on this track and don't speak up,"" he said. ""I'm asking myself what can we do, given our scale... to effect change, to elecate the discourse, and to demonstrate that this is not the way the country should be run.""

Schultz supported President Obama in the 2012 election but he hasn't endorsed a candidate in the 2016 election.

Brian Kilmeade is the co-author of the New York Times bestseller ""Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History"" (Sentinel, November 3, 2015).

President Obama was elected on a promise to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and avoid new wars. But a funny thing happened on the way to peace  more terror attacks at home and the rapid rise of ISIS abroad.

No matter how much hed rather focus on issues like global warming and gun control, the president has to rise to the challenge of this increasing Islamist threat.

America is in the crosshairs, and Obamas legacy will depend on what he does about it in 2016.

Hes certainly not the first president to have to shift priorities on the fly. Many if not all of his predecessors entered office with a clear agenda,only to watch world events scramble their to-do lists. When that happens, great presidents adjust to new challenges -- even if it becomes necessary to break a campaign promise.

Consider our third president, Thomas Jefferson, who took office in 1801. Like Obama, Jefferson was widely considered a pacifist who preferred diplomacy over war. But when Tripoli (now Libya) declared war on us because we refused to pay extortion and ransom to the pirates off the Barbary coast, Jefferson rose to the challenge.

He started with a display of strength to intimidate our enemies, sending the U.S. Navys newest frigates to the region. When that show of power wasnt enough to get the Tripoli pirates to stop their attacks and release their hostages, Jefferson ordered bombardment from those powerful new ships.

Unfortunately, then as now, long distance bombing didnt work. To the Islamic extremists of any generation, surviving against a Western attack is considered as good as winning. Thats why airstrikes and a few ground advisors wont break the back of ISIS today. In fact, ISIS just uses our bombings to recruit more terrorists.

Although Jefferson initially saw a land war as much too risky, he kept his options open. Eventually he recognized that theres no substitute for boots on the ground. Three years into the Barbary Wars, he embraced a plan by one of Americas finest officers, General William Eaton, to invade Tripoli over land, smash its army, and break the will of its leaders.

Eaton and a detachment of Marines took the major city of Derne in less than 3 hours. Yusef Qaramanli, the Tripoli leader, quickly surrendered. A deal was cut, hostages were released, and Americas merchant ships could finally pass safely near the Barbary Coast.

President Obama still hasnt learned the key lesson that Jefferson and other presidents (most recently George W. Bush) learned about the Middle East: You cant crush an outlaw Islamist regime from the air. The more we delay putting boots on the ground against ISIS, the more the American people will lose patience  and the more power and prestige ISIS will gain for surviving our attacks.

In his final year in office, with his legacy on the line, Obama needs to realize that winning a war is more important than his pledge to end a war. He needs to empower our military and trust the experts at the Pentagon. He needs to end the irresponsible releases of terrorists from Gitmo, tighten restrictions on immigrants from countries that support terrorism, confront our enemies abroad, and do whatever it takes to keep us safe at home.

Much has changed since the early 1800s, but if President Jefferson could learn the importance of ground troops, so can our current president.

Noreen had a hot gallbladder (inflamed).**

The question then became: Do they remove the gallbladder or drain it for eight to 10 weeks? Because of her somewhat deteriorating physical condition, they decided to put in a drain.

Thats where we are.

When her pain subsides enough from the gallbladder attack, she will be scheduled for the cryoablation procedure on the three ribs.

I just want to say that Noreen manages her pain in an amazing fashion. She still gives me orders! I love this woman.

Researchers uncovered the remains of the 160-million-year-old, plant-eating creature in China's Gobi desert. The new specimen has a unique ornamental texture on its skull, and it's much smaller than its famous distant cousin, Triceratops, which lived about 95 million years later in North America during the Late Cretaceous, the researchers said.

Though its anatomy suggests the newfound beast was an early horned dinosaur, it didn't sport any horns. That's no surprise  other early horned dinosaurs, including the small bipedal Yinlong downsi, which the researchers found in the same Gobi desert fossil bed, didn't have horns, either, the researchers said. [Photos: Oldest Known Horned Dinosaur in North America]

""It looks like Yinlong downsi, but much larger,"" said study lead author Fenglu Han, a postdoctoral student in the School of Earth Sciences at the China University of Geosciences. ""Most of the skull bones [of the new species] are sculpted.""

After analyzing the fossils  a partial skull and foot  the researchers named the newly identified species Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis (HWAL-ee-on SAR-ah-tops woo-sigh-wahn-EN-sis). In Mandarin, Hualian means ""ornamental face,"" referring to the unique texture on its skull, and ceratops means ""horned face"" in Greek. The wucaiwan part of the species name refers to the area in which the fossil was discovered, and means ""five color bay"" in Mandarin.

When the researchers uncovered H. wucaiwanensis in 2002, they initially thought it was an ankylosaur, Han told Live Science. But a detailed study confirmed that, like Yinlong downsi, the newfound plant eater is among the oldest ceratopsians known to science, he said.

""Finding these two species in the same fossil beds reveals there was more diversity there than we previously recognized,"" study co-author Catherine Forster, a professor of biology at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. ""It suggests that the ceratopsian dinosaurs already had diversified into at least four lineages by the beginning of the Jurassic period.""

A comparison of H. wucaiwanensis with other ceratopsians is helping researchers reassess the pace and pattern of horned-dinosaur evolution, the researchers said. For instance, little is known about the evolution of the small, parrot-beaked horned dinosaur group Psittacosaurus, which lived in China during the Early Cretaceous.

""Hualianceratops preserved some derived features of Psittacosaurus, and may provide more information of the origin of Psittacosaurus,"" Han said.

Moreover, H. wucaiwanensis lived at the same time and place as Guanlong, an early relative of Tyrannosaurus rex. It's possible that Guanlong hunted H. wucaiwanensis, but more evidence is needed to say for sure, Han said.

The new study is ""an exciting paper,"" said Caleb Brown, a paleobiologist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Canada, who was not involved in the study. ""These small, early ceratopsians are important because they can tell us about the early evolution of this iconic group.""

The analysis suggests that the evolutionary split between Neoceratopsia (a group that includes Triceratops) and Psittacosaurus is older than previously thought, Brown said.

""Given the pattern of relationships revealed by the new animal and new analysis, the paper also suggests that there are many more, and more varied, species of these small ...horned dinosaurs during the initial evolution of this group,"" Brown told Live Science.

The study was published online Dec. 9 in the journal PLOS ONE.

But what if your house could take care of you? That's the dream of the ""smart home""  and while there's no true sci-fi intelligent home that can do everything you need, we're getting closer.

Every day, 5.5 million smart devices are being connected in homes around the world, according to research firm Gartner. It further estimates there will be 6.4 billion of these ""Internet of Things"" devices by the end of the year, and 20.8 billion by 2020. If you want to get in on the ground floor, here are some gadgets you can buy today.

1. Tech to help you sleep better

There's been an explosion of gadgets that are designed to monitor and help you improve your sleep. The market for these gadgets is headed for more than $125 million in 2017, according to media reports.

Sense ($129) is a little orb that sits in your room, monitors noise, light, temperature, humidity and air particles and can wake you up at the ideal part of your sleep cycle. A tiny clip attached to your pillow tracks your movements. In the morning, it can tell you through an Apple app how much sleep you really got, and if something in your environment is disturbing your rest.

Some similar monitors include Beddit ($149), which also tracks your heart rate and breathing, and SleepRate ($100), which has an app full of useful information plus a wearable heart rate sensor. Withings Aura ($189.95) not only monitors your sleep, but it cycles through light and sound programs to try to improve it. Learn about other sleep trackers, including smartphone apps and smart mattresses.

These products mostly stand alone, but an upcoming sensor from Samsung called SleepSense will link up with Samsung's SmartThings Hub. When SleepSense detects that you're asleep, it will turn off the lights and TV and crank up the air conditioning. When you wake up, it'll turn on the coffee maker.

Note: Some fitness trackers that you wear around your wrist or clip onto your clothes monitor how well you sleep. Before you buy one, check out the exclusive Komando Fitness Tracker Comparison Chart.

2. A bright idea

How many times have you come home later than expected? It's dark outside and, of course, you didn't leave the lights on. You struggle to get the key in the door and, once you open it, you have to feel around the wall for the light switch. Then, room by dark room, you repeat those steps.

Wouldn't it be easier to tap an app on your phone while you're still in your car and turn on all the lights?

Lightbulb makers sell bulbs that you can link to the rest of your smart house. For example, with Philips' Hue LED lights and Philips Hue Bridge smart home device ($60; Amazon affiliate link), you can remotely turn on or off dozens of lightbulbs in and around your house.

These lights are also dimmable, so you can have softer lighting at night, or they can wake you up gently by turning on slowly in the morning. You can even sync your lightbulbs to your streaming music or movies. For example, you can program your Philips lightbulbs to dim automatically for optimal viewing when you turn on Netflix.

Bonus: ""Hey, Siri. Turn on the lights."" You can connect your Philips Hue lightbulbs to Apple's IoT hub, the Apple HomeKit. With it, you can use Apple's voice-activated assistant, Siri, to turn your lights on and off with voice commands.

3. A smart lock for your smart home

If you have a connected car, you may already be remotely turning it on or unlocking your doors without even touching your key ring. Cars are increasingly equipped with Internet-connected technology, so you can do things like unlock the doors when you've got an armful of groceries.

The same concept is at work in IoT homes. For instance, you can remotely lock and unlock your doors. Smart locks, like Kwikset's Kevo ($160; Amazon link) are Bluetooth-connected, too.

With Kevo and its smartphone app, you can program your home locks so only your family members can unlock the doors. You can set the times of day when they can unlock the doors, and you can give your house guests temporary access to your home. No keys required.

Once your family, guests and you have downloaded the Kevo app to your smartphones, you don't even need to take it out of your pocket or purse to unlock your doors. Just touch the lock with your finger, and it'll unlock.

4. Keeping things fresh

If you roll your eyes at the idea of smart appliances like a smart refrigerator, that's understandable. Why would you need a fridge that connects to the Internet? Actually, there are a few good reasons.

LG, for example, has SmartDiagnosis. If your LG smart appliance is on the fritz, it will connect you with LG's customer service department by phone, or with a smartphone app. The repair techs can tell you what's wrong and help you get it fixed fast.

Then there's food tracking. You can get alerts you when you need to restock an item or when an item is about to expire. Samsung's upcoming Family Hub refrigerator even has cameras inside, so you can check what's on its shelves while you're out grocery shopping.

5. A house that cleans itself

If you've ever been vacuuming and wished you had Rosie from the Jetsons around to help out, you can stop wishing. Roomba made its name with robotic vacuums that keep your house clean without you lifting a finger. But its latest model is the smartest yet.

The Roomba 980 ($899) has a Wi-Fi connection that lets you control it with a smartphone app no matter where you are. You can remotely tell Roomba to start vacuuming, and on its dashboard you can see what its been doing while you were out.

Plus, the 980 fixes one of Roomba's most frustrating faults. If you've ever used a Roomba, or another robotic vacuum, you can watch it clean and clean one section of your house and continually miss a spot. That's frustrating, but now it's been fixed: Using its cameras and sensors, Roomba creates a map of the room it's cleaning so it knows if it hasn't covered everything.

Bonus: Prepare for the future

One of the biggest hurdles to a true smart home is that most gadgets stand alone or work only with gadgets from the same company. That's why smart home hubs are going to be important.

Instead of tapping an app to unlock your door, then another app to put on your lights and yet another app to turn off your home security system, you just do all that from a single spot. There are plenty of companies pushing their own hubs.

But be sure to do your research on what gadgets will connect before you commit to one. Apple's HomeKit, for example, works with non-Apple gadgets, but only if they're HomeKit compatible. Some gadgets you buy might not be. Companies like Cassia and HomeGenie are creating third-party hubs and software that try to work with everything, but they, too, may not be fully compatible.

Whatever you choose, just keep in mind that it's still the early days of the smart gadget revolution. So enjoy what they can do, but don't be too surprised if everything changes in a year or two.

It also makes it easy to build up a list of present and future business connections. These are people who you're doing business with, may do business with, or who might become a future employer or employee.

To build your network, you can invite people to be your connections or accept their invitation. Just be sure they're real first. Plus, you can put your LinkedIn contact information on your email signature and on your business cards. That way, when you're sending everyday email, or passing out business cards, you can rack up more contacts. Of course, with all that work going into building your contact network, you don't want to lose it.

That's why making a backup on your computer is a good idea. Plus, having your contact list separate from LinkedIn means you don't have to log in to find someone. Fortunately, LinkedIn makes it easy to export your contacts to a regular spreadsheet.

Once you have all your contacts' information in a spreadsheet, you can print it out and run your finger down the list or search to find who you need. Or, you can copy and paste one or hundreds of email addresses from your LinkedIn spreadsheet to your email or Webmail. Of course, you can also export LinkedIn contacts directly to your email, if you want. Still, a spreadsheet is a bit more versatile.

HOW TO EXPORT LINKEDIN CONNECTIONS TO A SPREADSHEET

If you heard that LinkedIn got rid of its export-to-a-spreadsheet feature, it did for a while. That was to prevent unsavory businesses from scraping LinkedIn users' email addresses. Scraping is when companies use people's email addresses to market their products to them, or sell those email addresses to other companies.

However, enough people complained that LinkedIn brought the feature back. Still, it's one of several reason you want to be careful what email address you give out on LinkedIn. With that cleared up, let's talk exporting.

To export your connections to a spreadsheet, go to your LinkedIn profile. From near the top of the page, select My Network>>Connections. Then click the Settings gear icon in the upper-right corner.

Under Advanced Settings on the right side of the page, click on

""Export LinkedIn Connections."" Then from the ""Export To""

drop-down menu, select the .CSV file for Outlook or Yahoo Mail.

A .CSV, or Comma Separated Value, file is nice because it will open in any spreadsheet program, like Excel or the free LibreOffice. If you're using Mac, you can also select the .VCF file type to use with Mac's Address Book.

Once your file type is selected, click the Export button and

save the file. Open the file in an Excel or another spreadsheet program, to start making the most of all those LinkedIn connections you've made over the years.

While you're looking at your contacts, you might realize that

there are some you don't need anymore; they're just bogging down the rest of your list. That's why it's good every once in a while to go through your contacts and get rid the ones you're sure you don't need anymore.

Here's how: Near the top of the LinkedIn homepage, select My Network>>Connections. Highlight a connection's photo and choose More>>Remove Connection (it might say, Remove from Contacts). Just be sure you back up first, in case you accidentally delete someone.

Crystal City residents dont have any water they can drink. Black water came out of the pipes in homes in the tiny city where the sweeping bribery and conspiracy indictments brought down city leaders. Volunteers handed out donated bottles of water on Friday, as state environmental officials test the water for bacteria.

Joel Barajas  the only City Council member not facing criminal charges  told the San Antonio Express-News that he was grateful to residents elsewhere in the region who donated water. The city has blamed the water problem on dirt and mud build up in a water tank that was flushed, the newspaper reported.

""There are caring people in Southwest Texas,"" said Barajas, who has been thrust into being the point person for all of the city's departments.

Residents told Fox San Antonio Thursday they werent warned that the water tank was going to be flushed and were surprised of what was coming out of their faucets.

""It smelled as soon as I turned on the water we were getting ready for showers and I smelled it and then I started getting the text from my friends 'hey is this happening at your house look what's going on at mine,"" a woman identified only as Nora told Fox San Antonio.

""We didn't get a warning; we didn't get a warning that this was going to happen,"" she said.

And to add even more to the town's woes, the Texas Education Agency said Friday that the local school district could lose its accreditation after failing to meet state standards for the third straight year.

Crystal City leaders were charged with taking bribes from contractors and sending city workers to help an illegal gambling operator, according to a federal indictment released earlier this month. Another councilman is facing unrelated allegations that he helped smuggle Mexican immigrants into the U.S.

Mayor Ricardo Lopez resigned Friday afternoon, just days after he was arrested during a City Council meeting following a scuffle with an angry audience member  in full view of television cameras. That meeting was held to schedule a recall vote for Lopez and two City Council members.

I feel bad talking about the little town where I grew up, but this is ridiculous,"" Alicia Martinez told the Associated Press, 33. ""We need help to get it back to where it used to be.""

The Laredo office of the Texas Commission on Environmental is investigating the reports of black water. A water department employee said residents should boil water before using it.

The perfectly-preserved flowers named Strychnos electri are estimated by researchers from Oregon State and Rutgers universities to be from 20 million to 30 million years old.

It comes from the family of flowering plants called asteroid that gave us potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, petunias and our morning cup of coffee. But this one is from the genus Strychnos, which ultimate produce strychnine and curare  poisons used in everything from rat control to blow-gun weapons. Strychnine also played a part in the movie Psycho, in which Norman Bates uses rat poison to kill his mother and her boyfriend.

Related: Roots of ancient flowers reach back to dinosaur times

""The specimens are beautiful, perfectly preserved fossil flowers, which at one point in time were borne by plants that lived in a steamy tropical forest with both large and small trees, climbing vines, palms, grasses and other vegetation,"" Oregon States George Poinar, Jr. one of the world's experts on plant and animal life forms preserved in amber and a co-author of the discovery in the journal Nature Plants, said in a statement.

""Specimens such as this are what give us insights into the ecology of ecosystems in the distant past,"" he said. ""It shows that the asterids, which later gave humans all types of foods and other products, were already evolving many millions of years ago.""

The discovery of these two fossil flowers, researchers said, suggests that many other related plant families could have evolved in the Late Cretaceous in tropical forests and adds an important piece to the evolutionary jigsaw puzzle of neotropical forests that existed in the mid-Tertiary, long before North and South America were connected by the Panama land bridge.

Strychnos electri provides evidence that highly derived asterid groups were present in the mixed neotropical forest by the mid-Tertiary, Poinar and the other co-author Lena Struwe of Rutgers University, wrote. This suggests that many other present-day neotropical asterid genera and their families had also evolved by this time but their remains have not yet been discovered.

Asterids are among Earth's most important and diverse plants, with 10 orders, 98 families, and about 80,000 species. They represent about one-third of all the Earth's diversity of angiosperms, or flowering plants.

And one ancient genus, which has now been shown to be inherently toxic, existed for millions of years before humans appeared on the planet.

Related: Scientists discover prehistoric 'Jurassic butterfly'

""Species of the genus Strychnos are almost all toxic in some way,"" Poinar said. ""Each plant has its own alkaloids with varying effects. Some are more toxic than others, and it may be that they were successful because their poisons offered some defense against herbivores.

There are now about 200 species of Strychnos plants around the world, in forms ranging from shrubs to trees and woody climbing vines, mostly in the tropics. They are still being studied for medicinal properties, such as for the treatment of parasitic worm infections and for drugs to treat malaria.","[]"
"529","foxnews","2016-02-19 00:00:00","Medieval shipwreck hauled from the deep","[]","A nearly intact medieval shipwreck has been hauled from the frigid waters of a Dutch river.

The boat was likely deliberately sunk by maritime engineers more than 600 years ago in an effort to alter the flow of the Ijssel River, an offshoot of the mighty Rhine River that flows through six European countries. The trading ship sailed at a time when the Hanseatic League, a group of guilds that fostered trade across Europe, dominated the seas.

""The fact that we were able to raise the Ijssel cog [a type of wooden vessel] in its entirety and in one attempt is a fantastic achievement by the entire team,"" lead maritime archaeologist Wouter Waldus said in a statement. ""The shipwreck can become a symbol of our rich maritime history, and I fully expect many people, both young and old, to be amazed by and start enjoying this ship from the Hanseatic period's fascinating story."" [See Images of the Medieval Trading Ship and Reconstruction]

Surprise discovery

The boat was first discovered in 2012 at the river bottom during efforts to widen the flow of the Ijssel River. The massive ship was lying perpendicular to the river flow, along with a medieval barge and a punt, a specialized ship designed for navigating river deltas.

Over the course of the next three years, maritime archaeologists put in place a painstaking, meticulous plan to recover the ancient seafaring vessel. First, the team built a platform and crane on the river, then built a protective frame around the ship to lift it out of the water. After suctioning gunk from the area inside the frame, the archeological team created 3D images of the boat underwater. Only then were the team members ready to carefully lift the boat out of the water, using a basketlike structure made of straps, crossbeams and jacks. Each strap had its own motorized control to allow perfectly precise maneuvering in response to the forces experienced in the ship.

""This was an incredibly involved operation and was almost as impressive as the cog itself. The raising of the 65 feet ship was complex, in the middle of the river, near the navigation channel. Also, as a result of the fact, three different specializations had to work together here: an archaeological research team, divers and storage specialists,"" said Ben Broens, an official with the Rijkswaterstaat, a water management bureau in the Dutch government, which helped oversee the salvage operation.

Medieval cog

It turned out the 55-ton (50 tonnes) ship was a medieval cog, a type of wooden vessel with a steep, straight ship prow and deck beams that stick out from the boat's skin. Cogs were typically used in the late medieval period on international trade voyages. Many of the structural support elements, such as nails, were made of metal, meaning it was sturdier, and therefore easier to take out of the water without falling apart.

The team believes the ancient seafaring vessel was likely sunk deliberately. It was placed perpendicular in the stream of the river. By looking at medieval maps and historical documents and recreating the historical path of the river, the team found the ship was sunk at a time when silt was building up, creating huge sandbanks along the Ijssel River. Those sandbanks would have prevented ships from docking properly, so the ship, along with the barge and punt, were likely sent to the bottom of the river in a bid to narrow the river flow or divert it in a way that would improve sea traffic.

Though the ship was stripped of much of its original finery, the team did find an intact brick oven, as well as gorgeous glazed tiles, in the galley area of the ship.

Now that the ship is safely out of the water, the team will transport it inside its custom-made frame to a preservation facility in Leylstad, the Netherlands. There, it will undergo a painstaking process of drying out, which could take another three years. If all goes well, the Ijssel Cog will be placed on display in a museum. But if the ship can't be dried out safely, it will be studied thoroughly before being destroyed.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

TIME: Coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. ET



Carolina just cooled off one of hockey's top road teams, further growing its reputation as a tough home team to handle.

The Hurricanes will try to extend their season-best home winning streak Sunday night against Tampa Bay, but the Lightning have dominated this series recently and been a 5-on-5 force over their own mini-streak.

After a 5-2 win over streaking San Jose on Friday, the Hurricanes (27-22-10) are heading into the second of a three-game homestand seeking a fourth consecutive home win. They've gone 9-1-3 at home since the Christmas break, outscoring opponents by an average of 3.23 to 1.85 with a 93.1 percent penalty kill.

""It's a big time of year,"" Jeff Skinner told the team's official website. ""Every game you come to the rink, those two points are big. Even tonight, playing a Western Conference team, those two points are just as important as when we're playing anyone else in the league. It's a good win. Those guys are a good team over there, a good road team. It's big to get those two points, especially at this time of year.""

Skinner scored twice and Jordan Staal scored for a third straight game while adding an assist to give him 22 points in 19 games after managing 15 through his first 40.

Eric Staal's goal-scoring drought reached 15 games, but he at least notched an assist to end a seven-game span without a point.

""This is a fun time of year to be involved and to be playing,"" Eric Staal said. ""We're in the mix. We've put ourselves in that (position) and we've got to fight, we've got to win and we've got to pick up points every night.""

That's been the case for nearly two months with Cam Ward in goal. Carolina's No. 1 hasn't lost in regulation since Dec. 29, going 6-0-4 with a 1.90 goals-against average and .930 save percentage since the calendar flipped to 2016.

""He's our guy,"" coach Bill Peters said. ""We have a lot of confidence in (Ward and Eddie Lack), but we're going to ride a guy, and it will be Cam.""

Ward, however, has been peppered by Tampa Bay for more than six years now, going 6-10-2 with a 3.43 GAA and .895 save percentage, including four straight regulation losses. Among the 18 teams he's faced at least 10 times in his career, his 3.00 GAA versus the Lightning is the highest.

One of those losses came Nov. 1 as Tampa Bay (31-22-4) opened the season series with a 4-3 win in Carolina as part of a 10-2-0 span against the Hurricanes.

The Lightning are coming off Saturday's 4-2 win in Pittsburgh following a 6-5 shootout victory over Winnipeg, and they outscored those teams 9-3 at even strength.

""I didn't think we gave them a whole lot,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. ""When we did give them something, it was either we were on a power play or it was 4-on-4. But other than that, I thought 5-on-5 we played pretty steady. We got the lead. We played D. That was pretty much it.""

With that, however, comes a 0-for-10 power play as part of a 1-for-24 span, as well as two short-handed goals allowed in the last two games. The power play has been even worse on the road with one conversion in 41 chances dating to Dec. 6.

Individually, Steven Stamkos has scored in consecutive contests to get to 300 career goals, one of which came in November against Ward.

Tampa Bay's Ben Bishop is 5-1-0 with a 1.67 GAA and .950 save percentage in his career against Carolina.","[]"

"543","foxnews","2016-02-20 00:00:00","America, we could be looking at a Trump, Clinton contest","['Jessica Tarlov', 'Douglas E']","For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

UFC fighter Ronda Rousey got caught posting a photo of herself that was altered to make her appear slimmer  but not by her, she swears.

Following an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jimmy Fallon, Rousey shared an image of herself on Instagram. Her eagle-eyed fans quickly began commenting on whether the photo had been digitally altered  making her arms, waistline and face look skinnier.

A couple of days later, Rousey, 28, reposted the image side-by-side with the unretouched version. ""I was sent a picture to share on social for Fallon that was altered without me knowing,"" she explained. ""I won't say by who.""

The former UFC champion apologized in the post, adding, ""This goes against everything I believe, and I am extremely proud of every inch of my body. And I can assure you all it will never happen again. I could not be more appalled and hope you all forgive me.""

She has also posed naked on the cover of ESPN the Magazine and has appeared in sexy shoots for Maxim, she said, in an effort to embrace the body that used to embarrass her.

(Hint: The call button is not your friend.)

CALL BUTTONS: THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO SAY ""HATE ME""

What's your biggest job-related peeve? The kind of customer or co-worker behavior that just sends you up the wall no matter how well-meaning? For flight attendants, it's the ""call button."" You should basically never, ever, ever press it. I mean, like, ever. Some passengers regard the call button as their ticket to snacks and drinks before the rest of the cabin--no. Or a quick way to get rid of their trash while the flight attendants are still serving other passengers--no. Wondering when your plane will land? Or when those boxed lunches will be available for purchase? Your flight attendant passes by your seat about every 10 or 15 minutes (except in cases of serious turbulence), and you can wait your turn like everybody else.

YOU MAY MAKE MORE THAN YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANT

The flight attendant business is dogged by several myths, the most pervasive being that they are rolling in dough and perks--and getting rich off overtime. Nothing could be further from the truth. Flight attendants are paid for the time spent in flight, and delays just mean that they may work, say, 12 hours for seven hours' pay. Median salaries for flight attendants are about $37,000, with starting salaries around $16,000.

TO TIP OR NOT TO TIP?

Airlines and the Association of Flight Attendants discourage tipping, so when you offer a tip it is very likely your flight attendant will turn you down. But if you offer a second time, or slip a few bills into his or her hand, it will usually be greatly appreciated--and may earn you a free snack or even an extra-stiff Bloody Mary (if you're into that kind of thing). When you receive truly extraordinary service, though, a letter or email to the airline praising the work of a specific flight attendant or crew is most appreciated and can sincerely help a flight attendant's career.

PARENTS: YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANT IS NOT A DIAPER GENIE

New parents flying with infants are in an admittedly tough spot (my nine-month-old spilled orange juice all over me on our first cross-country flight together, but let's be honest, that was my fault). But just because you've heroically succeeded in changing a poopy diaper on your lap in the middle of an inflight movie amid turbulence at 30,000 feet doesn't make you Wolverine--and doesn't give you the right to hand the folded-up diaper to a flight attendant as if they can wave a wand and send it off to fairyland. Instead, travel with sturdy Ziploc bags that can hold not only Junior's expulsions but also orange rinds, apple cores, and granola bar wrappers until the crew is ready to make one of their frequent trash collection rounds.

NO, THERE IS NO ""SECRET"" TO GETTING AN OVERSIZE BAG INTO AN OVERHEAD BIN

We get that you don't want to pay $25 to check a bag both ways. But that means you've got to pack smart and, should you happen to sneak past the gatekeepers with a bag that's too big for the overhead bin, fess up and let them check it for you. Turning to an available flight attendant and asking, ""What do you suggest I do with this bag?"" is only opening up a conversation about what that overworked, underpaid flight attendant might wish you actually would do with that bag. (Tip: One of the best ways to avoid paying for checked bags is to sign up for an airline credit card, like the Citi Platinum Aadvantage Master Card, that allows you to check bags for free.)

SMILE!

Flight attendants go through careful screening during the hiring process, then comprehensive training before they start working with the public. For a good flight attendant, a smile and a friendly ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" is not just a good idea but also a job responsibility. For the best service possible, take a page from their playbook: Make eye contact, smile, address them the way you would a friend or neighbor, and you'll be amazed and how much more likely you are to get that extra blanket, cup of water, or sympathetic ear. (Sure, this precept should be obvious--but take a quick look around the plane to see how little it is observed among busy, cranky fliers!)

KEEP YOUR FEET OFF THE WALLS

Ever invited a friend over for coffee only to have them prop their feet against your living room walls? We didn't think so. If you're in a bulkhead seat, keep your feet off the walls. It's not just a pet peeve of flight attendants and pilots (who may call you out in public over it), but it can also be extremely dangerous to you during turbulent takeoffs and landings.

THERE IS NEVER A GOOD REASON TO TIE YOUR CARRYON BAG TO YOUR LEG

This one's a bit of a mystery to most flight attendants, since it only increases the odds that you will trip and fall when you try to get up out of your seat--or in the rare occasion where an emergency evacuation is necessary. But everyone has considered it at one point or another--including yours truly. But this is easy: Your carryon belongs under the seat in front of you (not on your lap, not on the empty seat beside you, and not under anyone else's seat), and your feet belong on the floor, and no mingling of bag and feet is ever, ever, ever a good idea.

YOU CAN HAND OUT SNACKS TOO

Frequent fliers glance at the snack cart and wince at the same-old-same-old. Guess how flight attendants who spend seven or more hours a day onboard feel about those packaged ""treats""? If you really want to make your flight attendant's day, board your flight with snacks not only for yourself and your loved ones but also for the crew! We always recommend that you travel with high-quality chocolate, not just because it's a nice surprise for airline staff at check-in and boarding, but also because it can really open up a flight crew to going the extra mile for you should you need it in the event of weather-related travel delays or cancellations.

SPECIAL OCCASION? SPREAD THE LOVE!

If you're flying on a honeymoon, anniversary, or other special occasion, flight attendants love to be looped in. They can help you make a little onboard fuss (the good kind!) and might even congratulate you over the PA system. If you're traveling with kids, it's basically always a special occasion, and the crew will do its best to accommodate a cockpit visit when the plane is on the ground. Just ask-but don't hit the call button!","[]"

""It seems like it happened right away but when I opened my restaurant I was 29 and I had been cooking 'full time' since I was 17. That's 12 years,"" Forgione says of his early rise. ""So I tell young kids all the time its not like you snap your fingers and you have your own restaurant, it was a lot of hard years.""

In fact, he was considering selling his restaurant --and even had meeting lined up with a buyer --but two days before he got his first Michelin star.

Since then Restaurant Marc Forgione has received numerous accolades, and by 2012 Forgione became the youngest American chef to maintain a Michelin star for three consecutive years.

But today he is focused not only on his restaurant, but other New York ventures as well, like his steak restaurant American Cut and the Laotian spot Khe-Yo.

Despite the variety in styles, he says there is a common component that keeps all of the restaurants together.

""I like to describe our style as honest, very respectful of the ingredients and the people that get them to us, and what we do with it. We let the ingredients drive what we're doing and then we think, 'what can we do with that without messing up, without being dishonest to the process here.'""

It is a philosophy of running restaurants based on the ingredients he grew up loving, but with one additional perspective that he has gained over his many years in the business:

""If you just make people smile with what you do you'll be a successful restaurant.""","[]"

When Rev. John Killian talks to his parishioners and others in Alabama about the presidential race, he says they raise one issue above all: immigration.

I really think thats the red-meat issue right now, said Mr. Killian, pastor of Maytown Baptist Church, near Birmingham, and former chaplain of the Alabama Republican Party. People are very frustrated, unemployment is rising and yet we persist in hiring overseas people.

Immigration, which took center stage in the GOP race Thursday after Pope Francis said GOP candidate Donald Trumps positions on the issue make him not Christian, promises to continue stirring up GOP voters and candidates as the presidential contest barrels toward the March 1 primary states. Concerns about undocumented workers and refugees run deep in a cluster of those states in the South. As a result, Republican presidential contenders likely will continue espousing hard-line positions on immigration matters, potentially hurting the party among Hispanic and Asian voters in the general election.

It is the Republican establishments nightmare. Its mandatory to reach new voters of all ethnic stripes, said Mario H. Lopez, president of the Hispanic Leadership Fund, a conservative advocacy group that seeks to draw more Latinos to the GOP. Any candidate who rejects that is ultimately going to be on the losing side of things.

After GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to President Barack Obama in 2012, a study commissioned by the Republican National Committee faulted the GOP candidates call for self-deportation as a solution to illegal immigration.

That comment and others turned off many Latino and Asian voters, who may not view immigration as a top-of-mind issue but can react viscerally if they perceive immigrants are being attacked. Mr. Romney garnered only 27% of the U.S. Hispanic vote and 26% of the Asian vote.

The RNC study urged the party to back immigration reform and strike a more inclusive tone with minorities. Yet on the campaign trail in the past year, Mr. Trump has said many Mexicans crossing the border are rapists who are bringing drugs and crime into the U.S.; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has ruled out any form of legal status for undocumented immigrants; and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has disowned the immigration-reform bill he helped craft in 2013.

On Thursday on CNN, Mr. Rubio said that he has said hed get rid of President Barack Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy and that he will. I will on my first day in office get rid of it because its unconstitutional, he said.

A November 2015 poll of Hispanic registered voters in 14 battleground states conducted by Latino Decisions, which does work for pro-immigrant groups, found that 69% of respondents said Mr. Trumps comments about immigrants, including his call to deport 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, gave them a very unfavorable view of the Republican Party.

Ahead of the Feb. 20 primary in South Carolina, the candidates have strived to outdo each other in talking tough on immigration, while attacking their rivals as potentially untrustworthy on the issue.

A similar dynamic could play out in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennesseeall part of the so-called SEC primary on March 1. Alabama passed one of the U.S.s strictest laws aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in 2011, parts of which courts later invalidated. Lawmakers at the time said the bill was aimed at making life so difficult for undocumented immigrants that they would leaveand many immigrants did.

Georgia also passed a strict measure in 2011 that authorized police to check the immigration status of some suspects and sought to deter businesses from hiring undocumented workers. Courts later struck down parts of that measure as well.

Some states in the South experienced some of the largest percentage increases of undocumented people in the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s. Those populations soared approximately twelvefold in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee from 1990 to 2009, according to the Pew Research Center. Though the numbers have declined in some states in recent years, alarm over the influx persists among many in the region.

Further inflaming the issue: the recent controversy over plans to allow some Syrian refugees into the U.S., a move some fear could open the way for terrorists to enter the country. Governors in states including Alabama and Texas, which also votes on March 1, have vowed to block refugees admission.

People here are literally scared to death, said Republican state Rep. Mike Holmes of Alabama, a Cruz supporter. Were losing control of our borders.

In previous campaign stops in the South, the GOP candidates have highlighted their stances on immigration. In Mobile, Ala., last year, Mr. Trump welcomed on stage Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican known for his hard-line positions on illegal immigration. In Nashville, Tenn., in December, Mr. Cruz promised to build a secure wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, as did Mr. Trump, and end health-care benefits for undocumented immigrants.

Expect to hear similar pronouncements in the weeks ahead.

According to Bloomberg News, more cruise lines are renting out their commercial ships for private hire.

Of course, anyone could afford the steep price tag would have to a superstar or a billionaireor both.

For example, Windstars 212-passenger Star Breeze cruise liner was rented in 2015 by an unnamed person during the Monaco Grand Prix. Bloomberg reports that a seven-day trip on one of Windstar's 212-passenger Star-class ships could cost ""from $600,000 to $1million.""

Crystal Esprit's private-hire rates start at a slightly lower $500,000 per week.

By comparison, a super yacht rental you could pay $731,000 for the same time frame.

So is there really a market?

Bloomberg notes that this luxury market niche my be spurred on by the super wealthily who feel limited by the number of guests allowed on even the largest of mega-cruise ships, which depending on the type of vessel, can hold between 12 to 36 passengers.

Last year, Hollywood director Steven Spielberg and Russian billionaire Kirill Pisarev both made headlines for ditching their multi-million dollar superyachts because they were too small.

There is an upside for people to rent these larger ships. Believe it not, it may cost the host less per person to invite someone on larger ships, due to the economies of scale.

The downside may be the lack of superior service you get on a private yacht or that some of these larger ships may not be able to anchor in smaller, more intimate spots.

But there's enough of a growth market that it's influencing the design of vessels newly-ordered by many major lines, noted Bloomberg.

Ships such as Crystal's 62-guest Crystal Esprit are made for private charter. Also France's Ponant has added four vessels to its fleet, each with just 132 cabins.

And with the world's most expensive yacht, the Eclipse built by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, valued at a cool $1 billion, the $600,000 rental price seems down right reasonable.","[]"

Tim Cook and his team made the right choice in laying all the cards on the table,"" marketing expert and President of JRM Comms Jason Mollica told FoxNews.com, via email. Apple let their customers and the general public know exactly what the situation was, how it could affect them, and why Apple could not support what the government was asking.

Related: Apple ups the ante in Silicon Valley's encryption battle with government

The tech giant announced Wednesday that it will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the Obama administration break into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in last December's San Bernardino attack that killed 14 people.

Mollica noted that Apples tough stance will resonate with consumers. There are many that agree with Cook's words and will continue to trust Apple's products, he told FoxNews.com. Again, transparency is something that people appreciate.

Suni Munshani, CEO of data security specialist Protegrity, also applauded Apples decision. It is the right stance to take because caving in to the governments demands would have extraordinary implications for millions of iPhone customers around the world, he explained, in a statement emailed to FoxNews.com. While I have empathy for victims and the families who have suffered great loss, it is regrettable that the actions of a few terrorists have brought us to think we must decide between personal privacy versus national security.

Social media giants Facebook and Twitter have backed Apple in its dispute with the FBI, as has Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users privacy, he tweeted Wednesday.

1/5 Important post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users privacy  sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

In a statement posted on Apple's website early Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said the order by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ""has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.""

Related: Legendary iPhone hacker weighs in on Apple's war with the FBI

The ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto shooter Syed Farooks county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature, which erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.

""The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake,"" Cook wrote. ""Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.""

Related: Use the dead to open an iPhone? Apple vs. FBI is getting weird

Michela Menting, digital security research director at ABI Research told FoxNews.com that the creation of a tool bypassing the self-destruct feature could have far-reaching consequences. I think its a dangerous line, and once breached, we are on a slippery slope, she told FoxNews.com, via email. What is to stop other governments from asking the same from Apple?

Requesting Apple to produce such a tool will inevitably result in two things: further requests down the road for providing more backdoors in other tools based on this precedent (including encryption), and, consequently, the slow and inevitable undermining of privacy as we know it today, added Menting. It may also mean that the U.S. tech industry moves abroad to more favorable governments (maybe Israel or Switzerland).

Related: Does Apple even have the ability to hack the iPhone like the FBI wants?

Americas tech titans have already voiced their concern about creating so-called backdoors into encrypted devices for government. In the wake of the Paris terror attacks last November, the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which includes Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter, rejected calls for weakened encryption.

Apple has been granted a three-day extension to Feb. 26 to respond to the court order to help unlock Farooks iPhone 5c.

Ken Griffey Jr. says steroid-tainted slugger Barry Bonds deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.

Griffey is serving as honorary starter for the Daytona 500, where he will waive the green flag to start the 58th running of ""The Great American Race."" Before he took his spot in the starter's stand Sunday, he met with the media and one of the first questions was about Bonds belonging in Cooperstown.

""Yeah,"" Griffey said after a long pause. ""I think that overall, when you look what people have done, yeah. It's not my vote, so I can't vote for him. But if you look at what he's done, those numbers speak for themselves.""

The polarizing home run king, Bonds is returning to the major leagues as hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Bonds is 0 for 4 in annual Hall of Fame balloting. He received 44 percent of the vote in January, a career high but far short of the 75 percent needed for induction.

Like Bonds, former home run king and admitted steroid user Mark McGwire also is back in baseball. He is the bench coach for the San Diego Padres.

Griffey declined to speculate whether being back in the game would help either one when it comes time to vote every year.

""I have no idea,"" Griffey said. ""My thing is I don't vote, so my opinion doesn't matter. It's up to the guys who do it for a living to decide what they want to do. I was honored by them voting for me. But it's up to these guys to determine if they get in or not. It's not up to me.""

A study out of Brigham Young University suggests obese people who undergo a certain kind of weight loss operation after age 35 may live longer than obese people of the same age who dont have the surgery.

The study reports that the gastric bypass operation is associated with a mortality benefit along with its better-known metabolic benefits. The data collected showed patients ages 35 to 44 were 46% less likely to die from any cause over the next seven years than those who didnt undergo surgery.

In this procedure, surgeons reduce the size of the stomach and reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract so that food will bypass part of the intestines as its being digested.

Others say the study results should be interpreted with caution, as bariatric surgeons exclude high risk patients from surgery so the obese people who had the surgery were a relatively healthy group to start with.

But along with choosing a provider and creating your birth plan, taking a tour of the hospital is one of the most important things you can do to ensure you and your baby will be healthy and safe.

Knowing the right questions to ask and what to look for can ensure that the hospital you choose is the best fit for you and your baby. Here are 10 to start with.

1. What level NICU do you have?

Each hospitals neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has designated levels of care, which are set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, its important that you deliver at a level III (subspecialty) NICU.

If you already know that your baby will require special services or will need surgery a few days after being born, for example, its a given that youll be at a hospital that has the appropriate medical team and services in place.

Even if your pregnancy is healthy however, you should make sure that if the hospital you plan to deliver in is a level I or level II NICU, they can still transfer your baby to a higher level NICU if necessary.

2. What amenities are available?

Its important to know what the hospital provides to help you manage labor. For example, youll want to know if they provide squatting bars and birthing balls or if youll need to bring your own.

You might also want to ask if you can bring in your own music or aromatherapy. Some hospitals also offer bathtubs for pain relief while others may only allow you to stand in the shower.

If youre planning to have a water birth, ask if birthing tubs are available, if you can arrange for one to be brought in or if you will need to give birth in a birthing center instead.

3. What type of fetal monitoring is available?

Once youre admitted into the hospital, your baby will be monitored for about 20 to 30 minutes. As long as youre OK, your baby doesnt show signs of distress, and you havent received any medication, you can walk around and have intermittent fetal monitoring until you deliver, said Michele Mayer, a certified nurse midwife at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. Your hospital may also offer portable fetal monitors, so be sure to ask.

4. Do you have doulas?

Studies show women who have doulas during pregnancy, labor and delivery are less likely to have interventions and cesarean sections. Plus, moms are more satisfied with their birthing experiences. Some hospitals offer doulas on staff while at others, you will need to hire an independent doula.

Although some hospitals will provide doulas if you decide to have one after youre admitted into the hospital, its a good idea to choose a doula beforehand so you can make sure you feel supported by her.

Its a relationship thats established during pregnancy, its not a last-minute decision, said Dr. Sherry Ross, an OB-GYN and womens health expert at Providence Saint Johns Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.

5. Can I eat?

If youre admitted into the hospital during early labor, your provider may allow you to eat something small. In fact, research presented at the American Society for Anesthesiologists last fall suggests that eating a light meal during labor is a good idea.

Once youre in active labor however, chances are you may not feel much like eating and you may even be nauseated.

Once youve received medication or an epidural you wont be allowed to eat, since theres a small chance you could aspirate food or liquid into your lungs if you have a cesarean section and need to be intubated, Ross said.

6. What are my pain relief options?

Its important to ask the hospital what your pain relief options are, including an epidural, analgesic medications, nitrous oxide, hydrotherapy or acupuncture, if there are any restrictions and if they will always be accessible.

7. Who can attend the birth?

If you wish to have more than one person in the delivery room, be sure to ask the hospital how many people are allowed to attend. Depending on the size of the room and the unique circumstances of your delivery, it may end up being a collaborative decision made between you, your partner and the doctors and nurses, Ross said.

8. Can we videotape the birth?

For legal reasons, its unlikely that the hospital will allow you to videotape. But once the baby is born, video, photos and FaceTime are probably OK.

9. Whats your security procedure?

After your baby is born, a security bracelet will be placed on your newborns ankle to protect him, but ask about other security measures the hospital takes as well.

10. Do you offer lactation consultants?

Breast-feeding may be natural, but it isnt always easy. In fact, more than 10 percent of women worry about learning how to breast-feed, according to a survey by Lansinoh.

One of the keys to success is to have support from the very beginning. So its a good idea to ask if youll have access to a lactation consultant on staff or if you should get a referral from an independent lactation consultant to come in.

Although your labor and delivery may not go exactly as you planned, knowledge is always power. Do your homework, keep an open mind and be flexible all things that will also serve you well when you become a mom!

Frill and horns may have helped dinosaur communicate","[]","The fancy frill and cheek horns that adorned the head of a triceratops relative may have helped the dinosaur communicate, possibly acting as a social or sexy signal, a new study suggests.

This isn't the first time researchers have analyzed the skull of Protoceratops andrewsi, a sheep-size dinosaur with four legs that dates to the Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. Protoceratops andrewsi lived just before Triceratops, and paleontologists regularly come across their fossilized remains in Mongolia.

As researchers collected more specimens over the years, they noticed a peculiar pattern: The frill was absent in juveniles, but it quickly grew disproportionately larger in relation to the dinosaur's size in adulthood. [Tiny & Old: Images of 'Triceratops' Ancestors]

This sudden burst in frill growth suggests that 6.5-foot-long P. andrewsi used the structure as a signal, possible to convey its dominance and age, and maybe even serve as a sexual sign, the researchers said.

""Paleontologistshave long suspected that many of the strange features we see in dinosaurs were linked to sexual display and social dominance, but this is very hard to show,"" study lead author David Hone, a lecturer of zoology at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said in a statement. ""The growth pattern we see in Protoceratops matches that seen for signaling structures in numerous different living species and forms a coherent pattern from very young animals right through to large adults.""

To investigate, the researchers measured how the frill changed in length and width in 37 dinosaurs over four life stages, including hatchling babies, young animals, near-adults and adults. The frill changed in size, as well as shape, becoming proportionally wider as the dinosaur grew up, they noted.

The dinosaur's cheek horns also grew larger with age, but they did not grow as much as the frills, according to the study. This finding suggests that P. andrewsiused its cheek horns for signaling as well, but more evidence is needed to confirm that idea.

""Biologists are increasingly realizing that sexual selection is a massively important force in shaping biodiversity both now and in the past,"" said study co-author Rob Knell, a professor of evolutionary ecology at QMUL.

""Not only does sexual selection account for most of the stranger, prettier and more impressive features that we see in the animal kingdom, [but] it also seems to play a part in determining how new species arise,"" Knell said. ""And there is increasing evidence that it also has effects on extinction rates and on the ways by which animals are able to adapt to changing environments.""

The study raises some interesting and compelling interpretations of P. andrewsi's frills and cheek horns, said Andrew Farke, a paleontologist at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, California, who was not involved in the new research.

""I would suspect that there is some sort of role in reproduction for this, if it's the adults that are showing the biggest size of this, it makes sense,"" Farke told Live Science. ""On the other hand, it's also likely that it could just be for how old are you relative to the next animal, so who gets to the food first?""

The study was published online Jan. 13 in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Apple announced Wednesday that the company will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the Obama administration break into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in last December's attack that killed 14 people.

But it's not because aquarium staff came to the conclusion that it's weird to invite a bunch of people to come watch octopi do it.

Rather, they pulled the plug on the eventa Feb. 14 mainstay for a decadebecause they were concerned the male octopus would eat his mate, KOMO News reports.

Weighing in at 70 pounds, Kong was just too much octopus for his female counterparts, who weighed 30 to 40 pounds. ""Theres a chance he would see her as food,"" the aquarium's Tom Carpenter tells Crosscut.

It could be that Kong dodged a bullet: Octopi are ""terminal breeders,"" meaning that both males and females of the species die shortly after mating. So instead, the aquarium let visitors watch Kong swim around with a diver on Valentine's Day, and later planned to return him to Puget Sound.

In any event, there's no telling what would have happened had the show been allowed to go on. ""A blind date is a blind date,"" Carpenter says, ""and you never know how it's going to go."" Lovemaking itself can be dangerous for the males, too.

Researchers in Indonesia have observed a female octopus basically strangle her mate during coitus and drag him to her den to eat him. (On the other hand, this little octopus is a romantic.)

"574","foxnews","2016-02-17 00:00:00","How to avoiding costly airline change fees","[]","Airlines now get one-fourth of their revenue from fees, and one of the biggest is a charge of up to $200 to change or cancel a ticket.

The fee galls consumers who find themselves with an unexpected need to change their travel plans. In some cases, the fee is more than the price they paid for the ticket.

When all the receipts are counted, it is likely that consumers paid the airlines more than $3 billion in fees to cancel or change a flight in 2015. That is triple what they paid in change fees in 2007.

Avoiding these hefty fees will take a bit of planning before you book your flight. Once you pay for the ticket, you're at the mercy of the airline. Experts have some tips:

GRACE PERIOD

If your flight is at least seven days away, federal regulations require airlines to give passengers 24 hours to change their mind at no cost.

Airlines can let passengers hold a reservation at the quoted price for 24 hours before paying, as American Airlines does, or let them cancel without penalty for 24 hours, as most other carriers do.

EXCEPTION AIRLINES

Southwest Airlines doesn't charge change fees. If you cancel at least 10 minutes before the flight you can use the ticket's value for another flight, but you could owe more money if the new flight has a higher fare.

Alaska Airlines lets passengers change or cancel for no fee if the flight is at least 60 days away.

TICKET TYPES

Refundable tickets cost more  sometimes substantially more  but they might pay off if you have any doubts about your ability to make the trip.

Also, some airlines offer bundled fares that include a free ticket change. ""The Works"" from Frontier Airlines costs more than a basic ticket, but includes a free change. You also get free bags and priority boarding. And it is refundable.

""Refundability is better than (a free) change because you get to say, 'I don't want to go.'"" says George Hobica, founder of airfarewatchdog.com.

Some experienced fliers suggest that you buy two one-way tickets if you can replace either one for less than the change fee on a round-trip ticket. Here's why:

Most airlines now sell one-way tickets for half the price of a round trip. Adam Goldstein, the co-founder and CEO of Hipmunk, a travel site-comparison firm, says he recently did this for a San Francisco-Los Angeles round trip. When he needed to change the first leg, he threw away his $80 ticket but was able to buy another for about the same price instead of paying the higher change fee.

TIME YOUR PURCHASE

If you book your flight many months in advance there is a greater chance that a crisis at work or an illness could cause you to miss the trip. Goldstein says you should book ahead of time because fares do rise closer to the flight, ""but wait until you are as confident as possible that you're actually going to make the trip.""

WING IT

Finally, ""You hope and pray your flight is severely delayed or canceled,"" Hobica says, because you are entitled to a refund if the airline can't honor your ticket. He says you should demand a refund even if the flight's schedule has changed significantly  if the departure time changes by several hours or a nonstop becomes a one-stop.

There are also outfits that will help travelers avoid hefty change fees by locking in a fare for several days without buying the ticket. It is like buying an option  you can walk away if your plans change, and it protects you from a sharp rise in the fare.

A start-up called Flyr lets you lock in a fare for up to seven days for a fee of $5 to $35 depending on the flight without buying the ticket, says the firm's product manager, Andrew Jing. There are limits to its service  American Airlines doesn't allow its fares to be displayed on Flyr or a similar service offered on Hipmunk. Some airlines including United offer their own versions of locking in a quoted fare for a fee.

U.S. airlines raised $2.98 billion from change fees in 2014, the latest full year for which government figures are available. Through the first nine months of 2015, revenue from the fee was up more than 2 percent, putting the airlines on a path toward raising about $3.05 billion from the charge in all of 2015. That's up from $915 million in 2007, and as extra charges on airline travelers go it is second only to baggage fees.","[]"

Using NASA open data, Ordnance Survey, the U.K.'s national mapping agency, has surveyed part of the red planets surface to create a one-off paper and digital map. The 2,282-by-1,691-mile Mars map, produced at a scale of 1 to 4 million, is part of an OS effort to assess potential use of its mapping expertise for future Mars missions.

Becoming more familiar with space is something that interests us all and the opportunity to apply our innovative cartography and mapping tradecraft to a different planet was something we couldnt resist, explained OS Director of Products David Henderson, in a press release. We were asked to map an area of Mars in an OS style because our maps are easy to understand and present a compelling visualization, and because of this we can envisage their usefulness in planning missions and for presenting information about missions to the public.

OS, which was created for military purposes in 1791, has 500 million unique geographic features of Great Britain in its database. The last time the agency created a map outside of Britains shores was in the mid-1990s.

We have set out from the start to treat the Mars data no different to how we would treat OS GB data or any other Earth-based geography, said OS Cartographic Design Consultant Chris Wesson, who designed the map. The cartographic style is something that is very different to your typical planetary map and is identifiable as an OS map. The key ingredients to this style are the soft color palette of the base combined with the traditional map features such as contours and grid lines, and the map sheet layout complete with legend.

NASA has a 2035 target for landing humans on Mars, although Elon Musk, CEO of private space company SpaceX, has predicted that people could be on Mars within 8 to 10 years. In December Musk said that SpaceXs audacious vertical rocket landing lays a critical foundation for reusable rockets that could help humans colonize Mars.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that pioneers tech for the US military, created the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program. Oregon-based company Leidos is working with the agency to develop the groundbreaking ship.

On Tuesday DARPA tweeted a picture of ACTUV being prepared for sea trials in the spring.

From concept: https://t.co/A2buvNq9DP to prototype -- this is ACTUV today, being prepped for sea trials this spring. pic.twitter.com/CsNQYmVl6S  DARPA (@DARPA) February 16, 2016

Without a human crew, this drone vessel will be able to execute important missions independently like tracking and trailing an enemy sub over thousands of miles  not just for a day or two, or even a few weeks  this drone could hunt the enemy for months.

Related: Drone swarms join the Navy

The ACTUV enemy submarine hunter is expected to be about 130 feet long. DARPA has announced that it will be revealed for the first time on April 7 when it will also be christened in Portland, Oregon.

In addition to hunting enemy subs, ACTUV will be capable of a wide range of missions, such as reconnaissance and counter-mine deployments. It could also be useful to resupply troops.

Whats the threat?

The rise of tough-to-detect and track diesel electric submarines poses a significant challenge to the U.S. Navy. ACTUV is designed to excel at tracking these ultra-quiet subs.

Diesel-electric submarines come at a relatively cheap price point of about $250 million, while giving their owners the advantage of stealthy movements beneath the surface due to their virtually silent engines.

Related: Historic aircraft carriers in pictures

How quiet is quiet? Reports suggest that some of these subs can be 15 decibels more quiet than a humpback whale.

Iran claims to have fleets of these sneaky subs.

How ACTUV will be a game changer

Enter ACTUV, which could roam the oceans for thousands and thousands of miles executing missions.

For next level tracking, the vessel will be armed with state-of-the art sensors allowing it to detect the quietest of enemy subs. The idea is that it will be nearly impossible for a hostile sub to slip the ACTUV when the unmanned vessel is on its tail.

Related: Israeli company Elbit Systems showcases robot warship

Despite being smaller than traditional subs, the ACTUV will be able to achieve speeds that exceed diesel electric propulsion submarines - and for a fraction of the cost.

ACTUV will have logic that allows it to not just identify other vessels, but also predict how they will behave. The sub hunter will be so smart that it should be able to interact, counter and outmaneuver manned enemy vessels.

It will be able to run operations as part of a team with other unmanned vessels operating beneath the water and on the surface. The sub hunter could also work in cooperation with manned vessels.

And get this  ACTUV is designed to figure out and comply with maritime laws, such as regulations to prevent collisions.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

When ACTUV enters service, it will give the U.S. military a range of advantages. Rather than send out a destroyer or a nuclear sub, ACTUV could be deployed, freeing up those assets and keeping costs down.

ACTUV will offer lots of versatility, such as launching from and returning to a pier  rather than having to deploy from a ship like other UUVs (Unmanned Underwater Vehicles). ACTUV will also give the Navy a vessel with far better endurance. It will also be able to carry far more weight than lots of the drone surface vessels launched from ships.

Whats Next?

After the big reveal in April, ACTUV will continue to be tested and refined.

Then, in 2015, their prayers for chicken sandwiches were answered, with the opening of the first stand-alone Manhattan Chick-fil-A restaurant. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to open its second Manhattan location.

Chick-fil-A isn't the only Southern chain gearing up for a Northern expansion.

See what it was like when the first Chick-fil-A opened in NYC:



Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Krispy Kreme announced on Monday that it signed a development deal to open seven locations in New Hampshire and Maine in the coming years.

This isn't Krispy Kreme's first attempt to penetrate a region dominated by Dunkin' Donuts. In the early 2000s, the doughnut chain opened, then shuttered, seven New England locations.

However, Krispy Kreme is convinced that the times are changing up north, and that even New Englanders are now beginning to crave southern favorites.

""The demand for Krispy Kreme doughnuts and coffee continues to grow throughout New England, so we are very happy to bring this iconic brand to New Hampshire and Maine,"" Patricia Perry, Krispy Kreme's vice president, global franchise development, said in a statement.

Part of the reason why Krispy Kreme is prepared to expand is because the chain is shifting its own image to emphasize quality and grow its beverage sales. The company is remodeling a number of locations, drawing inspiration from a new, Starbucks-esque concept store the company opened in Clemmons, North Carolina last October.

Chick-fil-A similarly debuted a more upscale design when it expanded into New York, swapping white subway tiles for more wood and natural tones. Staying plugged into different regions' preferences has been key to Chick-fil-A's expansion, allowing the chain to make changes to keep up with the times.

Another Southern chain that should be taking notes on Chick-fil-A's success is Bojangles.

About 420 of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based chain's 657 locations are in North or South Carolina. However, the company, which went public last May, is eager to expand.

Bojangles estimates it has the potential to open more than 3,500 locations nationwide, most of them outside of states in the Southeast that already have a Bojangles presence.

Currently, Bojangles is expanding by moving into neighboring markets, opening its first West Virginia and third Kentucky locations in 2015. Eventually, the company plans to open hundreds of locations in the Northeast, as well as the Midwest, Texas, and California.

Why are these three Southern chains expanding now? Ironically, in an era of hyper-healthy food, traditional Southern fast food is having a moment in the spotlight.

When customers seek ""healthy"" meals, often what they're actually looking for is some combination of nutrition and authenticity. While fried chicken and donuts aren't low calorie by any means, all three chains have majorly emphasized their dedication to their heritage and traditional Southern recipes.

""You do not want [customers] saying, 'This is not the Krispy Kreme we grew up on,'"" Krispy Kreme CEO Tony Thompson told Business Insider.

Another thing all three chains' have in common is their focus on breakfast, something that appeals to customers across the US.

In an ICR Conference presentation in January, Bojangles cited data that predicts the breakfast category will grow from $50 billion to a $60 billion daypart by 2019. McDonald's success with all-day-breakfast has proven that breakfast can be a major sales driver  something that benefits all three of these chains.

Fast-food chains like Chick-fil-A, Bojangles, and Krispy Kreme have been icons in the South for decades. However, as Americans across the country crave breakfast, quality food, and authenticity, it is finally time for Southern fast food to expand above the Mason-Dixon line.

"586","foxnews","2016-02-21 00:00:00","Musings Of An Average Joe: Make No Mistake, Obamas Snubbing Of Scalia Was Very Personal","[]","By Joe Bilello - Fox News

The president who continues to claim that his mission is to help bridge partisan divide has once again gone out of his way to create more partisan divide.

President Obama's refusal to attend the funeral services of Justice Antonin Scalia has led to much speculation about his motives. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed that Mr. Obama is concerned about the level of security required for a presidential visit. With the vice president, Supreme Court justices and other high profile people already attending, it can be safely assumed that the security footprint will be fairly large regardless of whether the president attends or not. According to Earnest, some people actually want to use the funeral of the Supreme Court justice as some sort of political cudgel. All of a sudden, President Obama is concerned about politicizing an event? Hasnt his decision to not attend actually caused the controversy? So, what is the real reason why President Obama decided not to attend? It is somewhat political and extremely personal. At least, ideologically personal.



Supreme Court Justices are not often viewed as political foes, but Antonin Scalia was essentially Barack Obamas ideological nemesis -- an honorable man with absolute respect for the Constitution and the law of the land versus a lawless man with virtually no regard, if not complete disdain for, the Constitution. Barack Obama, it has to be assumed, simply does not want to honor a man that he considers a political and ideological enemy of left-wing progressivism. Especially a man who had the courage and integrity to stand up to those who sought to undermine the Constitution. Antonin Scalia was a threat to Barack Obama and the American left.



Have you ever wondered how a man in his mid-40s doesnt know that he cant throw a baseball and would embarrass himself in front of millions of people? Its because everyone around him tells him that he reminds them of Nolan Ryan. People dont develop narcissistic personalities unless they are constantly given what they want and told how great they are. President Obama is not used to being defied. He is not used to losing.

And even those who criticize him in public ultimately cave to his demands. Despite constant claims of obstructionism, the GOP-led Congress has basically given the president everything he has asked for. Even Chief Justice John Roberts wanted to score some points with President Obama and the left with his ObamaCare decision. Obama knows he can break Republican Congressional leaders. He now knows he can break John Roberts. But he knew he could never break Antonin Scalia.



As a lame duck, President Obama does not have much political motivation behind a decision like this. As he prepares to nominate someone to fill the vacancy in the court, we can assume that his choice will not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia. Perhaps he doesn't want to be seen celebrating the life and singing the praises of a man just before appointing the man's polar opposite as his replacement.



The truth is that Obama's decision is not political in the sense that he needs to worry about running for office again. But it is political in terms of how he envisions his legacy. And while ones legacy is important to most presidents, it is an obsession for Barack Obama.



Barack Obama is not seeking the approval of those who will view his legacy as an utter and complete failure anyway. He is seeking the approval of those who will ultimately define his legacy. Those with an equal level of scorn for Justice Scalia. The college professors who will re-write history and indoctrinate a new generation of radical progressive thinkers. Snubbing the memory of Antonin Scalia would be seen as a badge of honor by anyone who would consider Obama's legacy to be a successful one.



President Obama is often misunderstood by his critics. His abysmal record has led many to believe he is incompetent. As Marco Rubio correctly pointed out, nothing could be further from the truth. He knows exactly what he is doing. His countless hours on the golf course have led some to believe he is disinterested, carefree, perhaps even lazy. This is also a dangerous misconception. Indifference is not a personality trait of Obama. He is calculating, passionate and committed to his radical agenda. President Obama sought to fundamentally transform America and he has been quite successful thus far. With a lack of meaningful opposition in Congress, there are very few people standing in his way. There are very few people with the courage and conviction to actually defend the Constitution and push back against the president and his progressive vision. One of those people was Antonin Scalia.



Rest in peace, Justice Antonin Scalia","[]"

The political dysfunction in Washington, DC has left many Americans feeling disillusioned, disenfranchised and  maybe most of all  angry that their elected leaders arent listening to them. Clearly, the country is yearning for strong leadership to get this great nation moving in the right direction again.

For Republicans, our party faces a critically important choice this Saturday too. In a crowded and competitive field, a very fine man stands out as the only proven conservative who has governed a major swing state and solved the kinds of big, difficult problems the country faces in Washington today. His name is Jeb, and here is why you should vote for him.

Leading Florida for eight years, Jeb held true to his conservative values while bringing Republicans and Democrats together around a series of reforms that made his state the national leader in job creation and small business creation. Hes the only candidate in the race who can say he has already cut the size of government, and on top of that he balanced eight budgets and provided $19 billion of tax cuts to Floridians.

Jeb is also passionate about reading and learning and recognized that, without a good education, a child cannot be expected to live a life of meaning and purpose. That is why he challenged the teachers union in Florida to pass sweeping  and conservative  education reforms that expanded school choice and provided parents and students with better learning opportunities. Today, Floridas high school graduation rate is nearly 50 percent higher than when Jeb passed his A+ reforms.

In the end, however, this nomination fight is not about the past. Rather, its about the future  your future. It is about your family, and your children, and who you want in the Oval Office that can actually deliver the economic growth, national security and real government reforms our country desperately needs.

The choice is clear.

Other candidates  who have no comparable record of accomplishment to which they can point  seem to measure strength by the loudness of their voices or the harshness of their tone. Jeb is even-tempered, serious and resolute  which history has repeatedly shown to be the true sign of executive strength.

The fact that Jeb has been endorsed by 30 retired admirals and generals and 12 Medal of Honor recipients speaks volumes about his readiness to serve as Commander-in-Chief. Jeb will be a president who restores our military strength and respects our veterans, and his economic plans will strengthen job growth and result in working families receiving a pay raise for the first time in a long time.

No one running for president has achieved more positive change for people in a bigger state than Jeb did. He was a transformational governor and I believe he would be a transformational president. I know that, if American people give Jeb their trust, he will work tirelessly to change the broken culture of Washington and to lift our great nation to new heights.

Marco, Bush said on September 13, 2005, in a ceremony at the Florida State Capitol, could you please come up here? Im going to bestow to you the sword of a great conservative warrior ...

Story Continued Below

The moment was significant, looking to observers like an anointment, a conferring of almost fatherly approval, a permanent linking of political lives. But today this long-term, now-strained relationship is hurtling toward a high-stakes climax. Saturdays Republican primary in South Carolina is shaping up to be the death of the presidential candidacy of Bush. The collapse of the campaign has something to do with the yoke of the Bush family history and a historically tumultuous, unforeseeable racebut the failure is particularly painful because it comes also at the hands of Rubio, the Cuban-American up-and-comer in whom Bush once identified potential and invested political capital.

It is widely believed that Bush and Rubio are mentor and protege, a tie even approaching familial. Based, though, on dozens of interviews with people who know them wellcolleagues and contemporaries in Florida politics, many of whom consider both men friends, almost all of whom over this past contentious year have had to pick sidesthat is a simplistic, incomplete and flawed characterization of the true nature of the relationship, which is less close and more transactional than previously reported. Perhaps no one misunderstood this more than Bush himself, and that misunderstanding is at the root of the anger and sense of betrayal that Bush, his staffers and his army of loyalists feel toward Rubio, from whom they had expected more deference.

The truth is, said Dan Gelber, the minority leader of the state house of representatives when Rubio was the speaker and Bush was the governor, Jeb wasnt a father figure, and Marco was going to be a star notwithstanding Jebs support.

It wasnt brothers, and it wasnt close friends, said a Bush backer wholike many Bush backershas a history with Rubio as well.

Its definitely not father-son, said Ralph Arza, one of Rubios best friends. I never saw or witnessed this mentor-mentee relationship.

These guys werent social buddies, another Bush supporter said. These guys were political friends.

In September 2005, Marco Rubio inherited a sword presented to him by then-Governor Jeb Bush, right, christening Rubio as the incoming Florida speaker of the House. Said one legislator in attendance during the ceremony: He was immediately tagged as a guy who was going places. | Phil Coale

I dont doubt that Marco Rubio respected Jeb Bush as a leader, but I dont suspect that he viewed that relationship nearly as personally as Bush and Bush people did, said Steve Schale, a Florida Democratic strategist who directed Barack Obamas campaign in the state in 2008. Marco got out of the relationship what he needed.

Less Shakespearean psychodrama, more a blind spot or a basic error in political math: There, back in 2005, it turns out, was Bushs first mistake in the failure of his White House bid of 2016. Recast, the sword ceremony that fall no longer looks like a gift exchange or a symbolic gesture. It looks like a transfer of power. It looks like the beginning of the end for Bush, and the end of the beginning for Rubio. There were people seated that day in the house chamber in Tallahassee who detected a whiff of noblesse oblige on the part of Bush and wondered, too, if he quite knew what he was doing by giving Rubio a sword. They worried that Rubio would one day use iteven against Bush.

***

Before the sword, the first time Rubio ran for office, Bush gave him money. It was March of 1998, Bush was running for governorhe had run in 1994, and lostand Rubio, 18 years younger, was running for a seat on the city commission of little West Miami, and they had a mutual friend. Al Cardenas was an ardent Bush donor who also employed Rubio at his Miami law firm. Cardenas gave the Rubio campaign $250. Bush gave $50.

Jeb was genuinely interested in helping people he agreed withsolid conservatives, said Nelson Diaz, who has known Rubio for 20 years and worked for him as his chief legislative aide in Tallahassee. Jeb did that a lot.

He kept an eye out for talented, energetic men and women who could be the future of conservatism in Florida, said Tom Feeney, Bushs running mate in 1994, who later would be the states speaker of the house.

When Rubio won his West Miami election, Bush called him to congratulate him. The next year, in 1999, Rubio won a spot in the state legislature. His baby face softened but did not conceal his obvious ambition.

He was immediately tagged as a guy who was going places, said Renier Diaz de la Portilla, who was elected to the legislature the same time as Rubio and shared an apartment with him early on.

Guzzling Mountain Dew, Rubio raced from Republican floor leader to majority whip to majority leader. By late 2003, he already had positioned himself to be speaker. His oratory in particular made him stand out. As a speech-maker, fellow lawmaker Dudley Goodlette said, Rubio was spell-binding. Said Frank Farkas, another legislator: When he would give a talk on the house floor, people just stopped. Rubios predecessor in the speakers role, Allan Bense, sometimes would attempt to gavel members to order but then turn to Rubio for help. Hed speak, Bense said, and hed calm the waters.

Even so, the man in charge in Tallahassee was not Rubioit was Bush. At the time, he was the son of a former president, and the brother of the current president, and a workaholic, activist governor with a Republican-dominated legislature. As the executive of the state of Florida, Bush almost always got his way.

Rubio, Gelber said, was obviously a superior political athlete, but Bush was the king of the hill.

Jeb, he said, was supreme.

There was then and remains now a vast contingent of Republicans in the capital city, and around the state in general, who owe to Bush their jobs, their positions and their influence. The word that comes up frequently in conversations with Florida politicos describing Bush: a cult of loyalty. Bush grew to expect loyalty, not just because it has been a basic political tenet of his family, but because in Tallahassee he so readily and regularly got it.

By the end of 2005, though, nearing the last full year of his two-term reign, Bush didnt see in presumptive next governor and then-Republican Charlie Crist a like-minded conservative. Bush needed someone to carry on his policies and to protect what he was beginning to view as his legacy.

He emailed his staff. I need to get a sword for Marco.

***

Some 170 of Rubios family members and friends flew from Miami for the ceremony in which he would be the first Cuban-American in Florida history to be designated as the speaker of the house. The floor passes that dangled from their necks, according to the St. Petersburg Times, sported a quote from Ronald Reagan. Theres no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesnt mind who gets the credit.

Throughout my career in public service, Rubio said in his much-anticipated speech, a number of people have taken the time to invest in me. He listed 10 names. He mentioned Cardenas. He mentioned Feeney. He mentioned the woman who was the mayor of West Miami when he won his first election. He mentioned state speakers, state senators, state representatives and congressman Mario Diaz-Balart.

He turned to Bense, the speaker at the time. I have learned a lot about true leadership just by watching you, Rubio said.

Bush sat in the front row, off to Rubios left, wearing a black suit and a fleshier face. Rubio thanked Bush, too, but in a different waynot personally, but on behalf of the people of Florida.

Governor Bush, Rubio said, we are honored that you have joined us here today. For the last eight years, you have been the driving intellectual force behind our movement. Your ideas have profoundly impacted the future of this state. And on behalf of the people of Florida, I thank you for your vision, for your commitment, and for your political courage. Thank you.

He pivoted quickly.

Bush giddily introduced Rubio at the victory celebration on November 2, 2010, at the swank Biltmore hotel in Coral Gables before taking a seat in the audience with his wife Columba. Im so proud of Marco, Bush began. Marco Rubio is the right man at the right time. | AP Photo/Lynne Sladky

But now, he said, this chapter in our history sets to close ...

He asked the members of the house to open packages he had left at their desks. It was a book, to be called 100 Innovative Ideas for Floridas Future. The pages were blank. Our ideas, Rubio told them, should be about tomorrow.

The speech, which is worth watching, because its a precursor for so much of what he still says today, elicited a sustained standing ovationincluding from Bush, who clapped and clapped and then shook his hand and gave him a hug and then followed Rubio at the lectern, speaking into the microphone, stumbling over his words.

Wow, Bush said. I cannotI cant think back on a time where Ive ever been prouder to be a Republican, Marco. His left hand awkwardly reached for a pocket of his suit jacket. I, uh, you know, I dont know how Im gonna talk now. I reallyI think that, uh, he capsulized exactly what the mission here is.

Bush looked up into the crowd at Rubios parents. He smiled and said, in Spanish, I know youre very proud of your little sonusing the diminutive for son, not hijo but hijito. And then Bush said this: Im 52 years old. I used to think I was young in this business. Now I see the incoming speaker of the Florida house, 34-year-old Marco Rubio, and I say, Its time.

And then he gave Rubio the gold and silver sword.

When Jeb gives Marco that sword, its sort of like, Listen, man, Im leaving, I dont know who the heck is going to be governor, and you have to keep up the mantle when Im gone, said J.C. Planas, a former legislator whos now an attorney back in Miami.

It was a big deal, former state representative Mike Haridopolos said. Whos he kind of passing the baton on to? This guy.

Marco was there to carry on the legacy of the policies he had put in place, Arza said. Jeb needed Marco.

Rubio hung the sword in his office, next to a framed Miami Dolphins jersey decorated with the autograph of former coach Don Shula, according to Rubios spokesman at the time. When the governor of the state makes a big deal of introducing you as really the standard-bearer to lead Florida in terms of conservatism, Jose Fuentes said, youre not going to toss that sword away.

PRESENTING YOUR SOUTH CAROLINA FIELD GUIDE

The polls say this should be a great day for Donald Trump  a big victory to ratify his status as the GOP frontrunner and a harbinger of future successes in the so-called SEC primary on March 1.

But the polls have gotten a little screwy in the final days of the first in the South primary, with Marco Rubio nipping past Ted Cruz in some surveys. Trumps dominance, however, hasnt been cast in much doubt.

His margin of victory matters, though. Given the resistance to Trumps nomination in many quarters of the party, a big win would be a big boost. The message from a Trump double-digit win: Resistance is futile. But if Trump stubs his toe and ends up with a narrow victory, it would only embolden his detractors.

With those high stakes in mind, the polls arent enough to get a grasp on whats really happening down South.

South Carolina Primary:

 50 total delegates

o 26 at-large awarded to the states overall winner plus the states 3 automatic delegates

o 21 congressional district delegates, 3 from each of the 7 total districts

 Open primary

 605,623 ballots cast in 2012

o Newt Gingrich, 40 percent, Mitt Romney, 28 percent, Rick Santorum, 17 percent, Ron Paul, 13 percent

 Polls close at 7 p.m. ET

[Watch Fox: Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier bring you the latest results from the South Carolina Primary tonight at 7 p.m. ET]

UPSTATE

This is not the South Carolina of palmetto trees and ocean breezes. This is Appalachia and very much part of what Michael Barone calls The Jacksonian Belt.

Voters here are famous dissenters and have long prided themselves on their stubborn independence.

But the Upstate of South Carolina is also fastest growing region of the state. The counties of Greenville and Spartanburg are home to big businesses like Bank of America, 3M and BMW.

For all the changes, the Upstate is true to its political roots. The region is one of the most politically conservative and most religiously observant throughout the South.

The more populous counties of the upstate region should be Ted Cruzs space. These are the most conservative voters in the state and have social issues on their mind. As the son of a preacher, and self-proclaimed defender of conservativism, Cruz relates well to these voters. In order to hold on to a second-place finish, Cruz needs to win in the more populated ares.

But Marco Rubio has a chance with these voters too. He is also a strong conservative who has been touting his family values throughout the state enough that he could siphon off some support from Cruz.

In less populated regions of the Upstate, however, its Trump territory. Counties like Anderson County are manufacturing areas, but havent felt the economic boom of the larger areas like Greenville just yet. This makes them more open to someone who says hell protect their jobs from going overseas.

MIDLANDS

Home to the states capital, Columbia, the University of South Carolina and a major military training hub, this region is fittingly somewhere on the political spectrum between the red-hot Jacksonian populism of the Upstate and the cooler political climate on the coast.

The city center and more affluent suburbs stand to be one of the biggest troves of votes for Marco Rubio. The Florida senator has paid plenty of attention to the region, often putting his plan for increased military spending front and center.

The Midlands is also home to the states best Republican bellwether, Lexington County, which includes part of Columbia and much of its suburbs, but also rural voters. A Republican stronghold, Lexington has picked the states Republican primary winner the past three presidential election cycles.

Communities farther from the population center are Trump territory. These are some of the poorest counties in South Carolina, with large African-American populations  the kinds of places polls have shown Trump excelling with blue-collar white voters. Places like Barnwell County, where 11 percent of adults have a college education and a low median household income, should be a sweep for Trump.

DOWNSTATE/COASTAL

The downstate and coastal area is the wealthiest and most politically moderate part of the state. The two major counties, Charleston and Beaufort, are vacation retreats and popular destinations for Yankee retirees fleeing cold winters.

But there is also a strong military and military retiree presence here that changes the political calculus. These are voters who lifted John McCain to his win in 2008 and kept Mitt Romney in the hunt in 2012. This should be the best part of the state for Marco Rubio, but it also is where he stands to have the most votes siphoned off by Jeb Bush and John Kasich. For Rubio to run second, he will need to prevent too much costal erosion.

Rubios endorsements from key South Carolina players like Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott should shore up any last-minute, undecided voters in this region.

Outside of these wealthier coastal towns, though, this is also Trump territory. Jasper County may be the neighbor to beachside Beaufort, but Jasper has a sliver of Beauforts population and none of the prosperity.

Thats sort of what the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport can do, when its not busy carving up the road itself.

The new high performance sedan has an active suspension system thats been programmed to know when it encounters the edge of a pothole and then reacts the same way that you do when bracing for impact, by stiffening up.

But in this case, that can keep the wheel from falling into a pothole by allowing it skip over it. By the time the rear wheel hits, the suspension has gathered more information on the obstacle and does an even better job clearing it.

Ford hasnt revealed exactly how big of a pothole the system can handle, but it partially depends on how fast the car is going. Along with making hard impacts less painful for passengers, Ford says it will help reduce damage to the suspension, wheels and tires, which a recent report from AAA says costs drivers $3 billion per year.

Unfortunately, the Fusion Sport wont be on sale until summer, when hopefully most of those potholes will be filled in, so you might have to wait until next winter to find out how good it works.","[]"

The good news, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , only one in five people infected with Zika (primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito) will get sick. So far, those who have gotten sick in the U.S. were infected outside of the country, though it appears the virus can also be spread through sexual contact. And once you have Zika, you are unlikely to get it again. The bad news, as we all now know, however, is that ZIKA has been linked to devastating birth defects of the brain called microcephaly.

If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the CDC recommends that you postpone travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. (For the latest information about Zika virus and travel, visit www.cdc.gov/zika.) But what about the rest of us, especially kids?

At the moment, there is no evidence that Zika virus is serious in young children or older children, said Dr. H. Cody Meissner , a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases . To date, the CDC says, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding.

Dr. Meissner cautions that infants aren't fully immunized and could be at risk to other diseases like measles. Even flying with infants can pose a risk from fellow passengers who unwittingly may be spreading colds and flu or worse .""If you have a newborn, that's not the time to go on vacation,"" he said.

You also shouldn't use insect repellent on babies younger than two months, the CDC says -- another reason to skip a trip to impacted areas right now. Use mosquito nets on strollers and make sure there are screens on windows. Also consider clothes that are treated with repellent. I've used them very effectively. (You can get them at REI, L.L. Bean and ExOfficio, among other places.)

For anyone, the best method to avoid any risk from mosquito and other insect bites is to follow the CDC guidelines, which include covering exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and hats and use an appropriate insect repellent. Apply sunscreen before insect repellent. Dress kids in clothing that covers arms and legs -- admittedly tough during the day when mosquitoes bite. Make sure when you go to bed, the windows are either shut or have screens.

Just FYI, this same mosquito also carries Dengue Fever, which I know from personal experience is no fun -- my daughter got very sick while doing an internship in Nicaragua .

Of course, no one wants to get sick on vacation or come home sick. Of course, you think it isn't going to happen to you. But remember, there really isn't a treatment for ZIKA, or a vaccine. If you have symptoms -- fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis -- all you can do is rest, drink a lot of fluids and take acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain. Also consider that you could be infected, not know it and then get bitten by another mosquito that then goes on to infect someone else.

If you don't want this pesky bug to derail your plans -- and resorts are quick to say they are doing all they can to keep bugs at bay -- the CDC says you should make not getting bitten a priority.

If you'd rather avoid the hassle entirely -- maybe head to the snowinstead -- airlines, resorts and cruise lines seem to be offering refunds or credits for future travel on a case-by-case basis. Just Google your carrier, hotel or cruise line and ZIKA virus to find out what they will do for you.

If you have booked on one of Carnival's 10 brands, for example, and are pregnant, the company will offer you alternate itinerary options or a future cruise credit. ""We are proactively providing all of our guests with information regarding Zika,"" the Carnival spokesman said, adding, ""We have not altered any of our itineraries but are closely monitoring the U.S. CDC and PAHO ( Pan American World Health Organization ) travel advisories for any updates to the Zika transmission areas and communicating with our guests accordingly.""

Karisma resorts notes that no cases of the Zika virus have been reported at or near any of their properties in the Riviera Maya, Mexico , Jamaica or the Dominican Republic . But the company will honor any related requests to refrain from travel at this time without penalty.

This is one case you can't necessarily count on travel insurance, unless you have bought a policy that allows ""cancel for any reason."" Most policies don't cover cancellation due to fear of travel, explained Megan Freedman , executive director of the US Travel Insurance Association . Read the fine print carefully.

If you are pregnant, Freedman added, and your doctor has advised against travel to an area affected by Zika, check with your travel insurance carrier to see if, in that case, you would be covered. ""It is going to vary by company,"" she said.

Clearly, if you have concerns and have booked already, see what your hotel will do for you. It's certainly not unreasonable to ask for a refund in this case and remember, they want happy customers.

""We don't know the full spectrum of the disease,"" warned Dr. Meissner. ""This is an individual decision every family has to make.""

The director of ""Moche and Its Neighbors: Reconstructing Identities,"" Cecilia Pardo, told EFE that the show seeks to offer ""an archaeological study of the mythological images that defined that culture.""

One element is the hero Ai Apaec (the powerful, the achiever), a man with catlike attributes who goes to sea to fight against frightening creatures, then moves upon the mountains,"" Pardo said.

The expo is made up of 80 ceramic, metal and fabric items associated with Mochica art and on loan from Peru's Larco Museum, the National Museum of Archaeology, and from archaeological remains on the north coast, such as San Jose de Moro and the Huacas of Moche.

One of the two galleries is dedicated to Ai Apaec, and Pardo notes his importance because, ""for the first time, we can confirm that these seemingly semi-divine characters are in fact real.""

About the Moche hero, Pardo spoke of his relations with ""people at the limits of the world, limits that this complex civilization determined to be at sea and on the mountains, and were ""fundamental to their concept"" of the universe.

Ai Apaec traded in various goods including coca leaf, which he obtained from eastern communities like La Libertad and Cajamarca.

The second gallery exhibits the construction of the ""collective identity of the Moches, the process of consolidating the Mochica state, and its relations with neighboring populations and the lands along the coast, in the south and on the mountains,"" Pardo said.

The exhibition, open until Aug. 14, is part of the MALI initiative to organize a different pre-Columbian art exhibition every year; in 2017 it will be dedicated to the Nazca culture, the director said. EFE","[]"

The team successfully reconstructed complete pathogen genomes from victims of the Great Plague of Marseille, which raged from 1720 to 1722. Scientists used teeth from plague pits in Marseille to access tiny fragments of DNA that had been preserved for hundreds of years.

""We faced a significant challenge in reconstructing these ancient genomes,"" said computational analyst Alexander Herbig, in a press release.

However, the geographical source of the Great Plague of Marseille has not yet been identified, according to Kirsten Bos, a lead author of the publication.

""Our results suggest that the disease was hiding somewhere in Europe for several hundred years, she noted.

We recently got this question from a viewer:

Dear Dr. Manny,

I get pain in my jaw when it's really cold out. Why does this happen?

Thanks,

Meghan

The first thing you should do is get your teeth checked to rule out cavities as a cause for your pain. But the weather can have an effect on your body in ways you may not expect.

Studies have shown that changes in barometric pressure that often accompany a drop in temperature can trigger pain by causing air pockets throughout your body to expand and/or shrink, putting pressure on the nerves.

Temporomandibular joint disorders, or TMJ, are also common in adult women.

Symptoms can include:

Earaches

Headaches

Chewing pain

Difficulty opening your mouth

Clicking or grating sounds in the joint

Shivering in cold weather can cause the muscles in your jaw to constrict or spasm, which can also result in pain.

Always talk to your doctor to determine the best treatment based on your condition.

But there's an Asian fruit that's come a serious alternative for meaty and savory protein.

Jackfruit is the largest tree-borne fruit on the planet (these beasts can weigh up to 75 pounds) and is indigenous to South America and South-east Asia.

It's got a tough, green, knobby exterior, sticky sap and odd looking seed pods that taste like a cross between a pineapple and a pear.

But in its unripened form --and after several hours of brining and basting and baking--a meaty like substance that looks something like pulled pork is created.

More on this... What's BBQ jackfruit like?

Jackfruit has started appearing on the menus of hip restaurant and mainstream barbecue joints around the country, including Baltimore's Blue Pit and San Francisco's Sneaky's BBQ. They even sold a jackfruit BBQ sandwich to Super Bowl ticket holders at Levis Stadium this month.

The process to prepare the jackfruit into something resembling barbecue is pretty time consuming, that is if you can find the raw ingredients. The jackfruit is usually sold either in a can or in a bag soaking in brine. (Chinese food markets are your best bet.)

But there are a handful of food purveyors that sell pre-made, pre-seasoned barbecue-style jackfruit.

Now, we love our pulled pork (and all types of BBQ), so we were a bit skeptical. So, we decided to take Uptown Naturals BBQ flavor to the streets of New York City--and were kind of shocked by the response.

""I'm a fan,"" said one woman.

""I like the actual pork, but this is a really good substitute,"" said another taster.

The jackfruit had the consistency of barbecue and tasted of barbecue. It was smokey, tangy and had a hint of sweetness, but at the end of the day, you knew it wasn't real barbecue.

For vegans or those who want to cut the cholesterol or meat consumption, it's a decent alternative.

But not everyone we spoke to was a fan. One person described it as eating bamboo. Another man, well, he had no words.","[]"

Irish-born graduate Eimear Ni Ghiallgairrh, 29, whipped off her skirt in the customs area in protest over delays. She was left standing in her black tights before the officers attempted to preserve her modesty and prevent any further revelations.

The trained architect claims she broke her arm in the scuffle as she was arrested. She was held in a cell for 12 hours and ripped up a police code of conduct handbook, a court heard.

Ghiallgairrh pleaded guilty to disorderly behavior and criminal damage when she appeared before Chelmsford magistrates this week.

Prosecutor Karen Phillips told how Ghiallgairrh was running late for a flight to Ireland and became frustrated at the situation as she was held up in security.

Miss Phillips added: She refused to be searched, became heated, got agitated and removed her skirt, standing in her tights.

Members of the public around were distressed as she was undressing. She also banged on the desk angrily.

But Ghiallgairrh blamed the incident on the overzealous security.

She said: I was becoming increasingly frustrated by the airport staff. A police officer came from behind me as I leant casually on the table, I turned around to hear him tell me to calm down.

He said youre on drugs. I said Im not on drugs. He said I shouldnt talk to him like that because he had a machine gun.

I asked why he would need to use a machine gun on me. He said that if I didnt shut up he was going to arrest me. I asked Why? What for?

He aggressively handcuffed me and shouted section four while lifting me up by my wrist, breaking my thumb as a consequence. I screamed in pain.

The architects arm was broken when two officers arrested her. She was fined $300 after pleading guilty to disorderly behavior and criminal damage.

District Judge John Woollard fined Ghiallgairrh $160 with $40 victim surcharge and $100 costs as she sat with her arm in plaster.

He added: I have to take into account the stress you were in which led to your behavior and the fact you were surrounded by thousands of other people also stressed.

Ghiallgairrh has been in the U.K. for 18-months and the court was told she is planning on going back to Ireland.

Gibbs has four strong chances Sunday to earn a second Daytona 500 victory, and his stable of Toyotas has been among the strongest cars during Speedweeks. The main competition comes from Daytona's favorite son  two-time 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his Hendrick Motorsports teammates.

Denny Hamlin and reigning Sprint Cup champion Kyle Busch already have given Gibbs a pair of wins this week at Daytona International Speedway. But the three-time Super Bowl winning coach has had his heart broken nearly two dozen times since Dale Jarrett took Joe Gibbs Racing to victory lane at Daytona in 1993.

Gibbs isn't used to losing  his only Super Bowl defeat was to the Raiders a decade before he won NASCAR's version of the big game  and he has made it clear he wants a win in NASCAR's season opener.

""There's always pressure from Coach,"" Carl Edwards said. ""Coach wants to win everything.""

JGR's lone defeat during Speedweeks came in the first qualifying race, with Earnhardt passing Hamlin with ease for the victory. Afterward, Earnhardt raved about his car  nicknamed ""Amelia Earhart"" because he feels unbeatable in that speedy Chevrolet. Amelia has won four of six races over 13 months and never finished lower than third.

""This car is something special,"" Earnhardt said.

It's often difficult to figure out who is the class of the field leading into the 500 because no one knows who may be playing it close to the vest. But JGR and Hendrick have the most speed, and proved it when rookie Chase Elliott put Jeff Gordon's famed No. 24 Chevrolet on the pole next to Gibbs driver Kenseth.

Elliott, the 20-year-old son of Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, could have his hands full in his first 500. He raced against teammate Earnhardt in the qualifying event, and Earnhardt warned him to be selfish on the track.

""I told Chase on the starting grid, 'I'm not going to be helping you. Don't help me,'"" Earnhardt said. ""'Don't worry about where I'm at. If I'm behind you in one of the lines, don't jump in thinking you're trying to help me. Do everything you can to keep the lead. Don't give the lead up no matter what.

""'I'm going to do what I need to do for me. You do what you need to do for you. You just got to be selfish.'""

Elliott, part of a new youth group moving into NASCAR's elite series, isn't alone in having to prove his mettle during the biggest race of the year. Ryan Blaney has proven to be fearless in restrictor-plate races, but the 22-year-old had trouble getting other drivers to trust him enough to draft with him last fall at Talladega.

It was a struggle as well in Thursday's qualifying race, when he came from a lap down in the Wood Brothers' famed No. 21 Ford to finish third. But he's a de facto teammate to Team Penske drivers Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano, the defending Daytona 500 winner, and should the Fords figure out an effective game plan, they may be able to disrupt the Gibbs and Hendrick juggernaut.

Blaney knows he'll have to prove himself lap after lap Sunday so someone will work with him in crunch time.

""If someone can get like a blowtorch, burn the yellow stripes off the bumper, that's going to help,"" Blaney said of the stripe on the back of his car that signifies his rookie status.

It wouldn't be unheard of for Elliott or Blaney to earn an upset win. Trevor Bayne pulled it off driving for the Wood Brothers in 2011 in his Daytona 500 debut. But ""The Great American Race"" is no longer considered the wide-open shootout most everyone once considered the hectic pack race.

The best plate racers have separated themselves from the field, and those usual suspects are typically the ones in contention.

""At every other race track we go to, you're single-minded, you're selfish and you're a jerk,"" Earnhardt said. ""You're a jerk on restarts. You're a jerk every time you're battling for position. You're not doing anybody any favors out there. You're not trying to help anybody. That's racing. That's the way it's always been, right?

""That's why you see the same guys up there, because they understand the mentality. Different styles work. Denny and mine is real similar. He's aggressive. Logano, he's aggressive. But Kenseth does well, and he's not quite as aggressive. He's real smart. It's a mentality, I guess, where you just have to be a selfish jerk.""

Hamlin understands that clearly and feels like not having won a Daytona 500 yet is a gaping hole in his resume. Same goes for teammate Busch, who has come up empty when he thought he had a winning car.

Busch has placed a special emphasis on this Daytona 500, though, because he missed the race a year ago. He broke his right leg and left foot in a crash the day before the 500 and missed 11 races. Still, he rallied to win his first Sprint Cup title in November and wants to open his title defense with a win for Gibbs.

Still, he refuses to go into Sunday thinking the famed track owes him anything.

""I don't think you're ever owed anything. I think certain things just come back through cycle,"" Busch said. ""There may be times where you're at a race track, you're horrible at it. ... You come so close to winning a particular race, boom, it's taken out from underneath you. A few years later, you win it.

""I think if I could end up in victory lane on Sunday, then I certainly think it would kind of come full circle essentially. I'd love to have that happen, but I'm not expecting anything from the race track or the racing gods to make that happen.""","[]"

Republicans are hoping to build on Hogans success by electing the first GOP U.S. senator from Maryland since 1987, in the contest to fill the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski.

Maryland House Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga is one of six GOP Senate candidates looking to duplicate the Hogan miracle in the partys April 26 primary.

As the highest-ranking Republican woman in the state Legislature, shes the perceived front-runner and boasts significant support from the political establishment.

Szeliga told InsideSources that the tide is changing in Marylan and that voters want a senator focused on jobs, national security and education.

As the only woman in the Republican field, Szeliga also argued shes a good fit for an electorate thats 60 percent female.

Its an uphill climb during a presidential election, especially in a state with more than twice as many registered Democrats as registered Republicans.

In addition, the Democratic candidate in the general election will likely either be Maryland Reps. Chris Van Hollen or Donna Edwards, who each have strong name recognition, though no strong connections to Baltimore's Democratic machine.

Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings said last week that he will not seek Mikulskis seat. Cummings has strong ties to Baltimore and would have become the instant frontrunner, according to some early polling.

Szeliga is facing several other candidates the the party primary including Chrys Kefalas, the 36-year-old vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers who thinks hes the candidate to replicate Hogans win.

A former legal counsel to Marylands previous GOP governor, Bob Ehrlich, Kefalas played up the fact that, as was the case with Hogan, hes never held public office.

""The people of Maryland, whether theyre Democrat, independent or Republican, are not looking for a politician, he said.

Szeliga touts her three decades of business experience -- including at a construction company she founded with her husband.

Kefalas said Republicans also need to compete in places like Baltimore, and in fact the entire campaign will turn on whether his party appeals to voters beyond its conservative base.

Its going to be very hard to get more Republican voters to the polls [than Hogan did in 2014], he said. The key to this election, with 250,000 or 300,000 more Democratic voters turning out in a presidential year, is doing better than Gov. Hogan did in predominantly Democratic and independent jurisdictions.

Kefalas, who is openly gay, plans to tout his advocacy for marriage equality and service as a speechwriter to former Attorney General Eric Holder.

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","[]"

In 2013, ""benzos"" played a role in 31 percent of the nation's 22,000 prescription overdose deaths, reports STAT. Seeing the rise in ODs outpace the rise in prescriptions suggests ""people have been taking them in a riskier way over time,"" says lead author Marcus Bachhuber.

One theory is that the spike in deaths is linked to higher dosesthe amount of benzodiazepine in prescriptions doubled over the study period, notes CNN.

It's also possible that people are taking them carelessly along with alcohol or opioids, in which case their ""lethality is magnified,"" says a doctor not involved with the study.

The authors caution that benzodiazepines are being over-prescribed in general and suggest doctors should look into alternatives drugs or treatments such as talk therapy.

The next-generation Galaxy S7 is expected to be one of the biggest pieces of news at the major mobile tech conference that kicks off Monday in Barcelona.

But dont expect any major changes to the physical design of Samsungs flagship phones. The curved display S7 edge should look pretty much the same, while the flatscreen S7 may see some subtle changes, according to reports.

But both Samsung phones may come with major internal changes, reflecting what Apple typically does with its s models. Those upgrades include improved battery life, a better camera, and a faster processor. All under-the-hood stuff but important to keep Samsung relevant vis-a-vis Apple.

Samsung is also keen on pushing ahead with virtual reality these days so new announcements about Gear VR are likely. The S6 and S6 edge plug into the Gear VR headset and function as the headsets display and processor. For that reason, any improvements to the S7s processor, for example, could boost the platforms capabilities.



Maybe more importantly, this would allow Samsung demonstrate that it is getting further ahead of Apple, which currently has no Apple-branded iPhone VR products (though Apple does sell third-party VR headsets on its store page).

Other major news includes:



LG: The other South Korean phone maker will show off its next-gen LG G5. So far, the most talked-about changes are not the phone itself but accessories such as a touch-enabled case. Like Samsung, LG is focusing on VR and rumors point to a few VR-related accessories and upgrades.



Huawei: the rising smartphone star is slated to make announcements at the conference. They may include a new phone but little more is known at this point outside of sketchy rumors.



Xiaomi: another rising smartphone maker, it is still heavily focused on areas outside of the U.S. Its new phone could include a raft of upgrades that new phones typically get.



Microsoft Lumia 650: while this Windows phone has already been announced, it has garnered a lot of media attention because of its top-flight materials and design. On price (about $200), it slots in below the higher-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL but beats both of those phones on aesthetics.

Trump captures 32 percent among South Carolina likely Republican primary voters. Ted Cruz gets 19 percent to Marco Rubios 15 percent. These are the only three candidates earning double-digit support.

Jeb Bush and Ben Carson tie at nine percent each, and John Kasich gets six percent.

Theres little difference among only those who say they will definitely vote in the GOP primary: Trump garners 34 percent, Cruz 20 percent, Rubio 15 percent, Bush 8 percent, Carson 7 percent, and Kasich 6 percent.

Some support could still shift, as 25 percent of these GOP likely voters say they could change their mind.

CLICK TO READ THE POLL RESULTS.

Trump has more supporters (83 percent) who feel certain they will vote for him than Cruz (73 percent) or Rubio (71 percent).

The race remains consistent when first and second vote choices are combined: Trump 41 percent, Cruz 35 percent, Rubio 32 percent, Bush and Carson 20 percent each, and Kasich 16 percent.

The poll, released Thursday, was conducted Monday through Wednesday evenings. Many political observers felt the Republican faithful might abandon the front-runner after the rowdy February 13 GOP debate in Greenville, where Trump said President George W. Bushs administration lied to push the U.S. into the Iraq war and Planned Parenthood does wonderful things for womens health.

Even so, the performance didnt hurt Trump with his backers. Support for Trump is mostly unchanged since early December when he received 35 percent. At that time, Carson had 15 percent support, and Cruz and Rubio were tied at 14 percent.

About 6 in 10 Palmetto State Republicans identify as evangelical Christian, while 4 in 10 are very conservative, and nearly 2 in 10 have served in the military.

Among evangelical Christians voting in the GOP primary, Trump tops Cruz by eight points: Trump 31 vs. Cruz 23 percent. Rubio receives 17 percent and Bush 10 percent.

Cruz is the top pick among very conservatives -- but just barely. He receives 31 percent, Trump 29 percent, and Rubio 14 percent.

Veterans, a small subgroup of voters, back Trump (37 percent), over Cruz (22 percent), Rubio (15 percent), and Bush (9 percent).

Whites with a college degree go for Trump (30 percent), and put Rubio in second (19 percent) over Cruz (15 percent). Whites without a degree put Trump over Cruz by nine points (34-25), with Rubio in third (11 percent).

Trump is the favorite for both men (35 percent) and women (28 percent) voting in the GOP primary.

Meanwhile, nearly four in 10 South Carolina Republicans say they would never support Trump (39 percent). Thats up from 24 percent who felt that way in December.

Some 21 percent would never vote for Bush, 19 percent Cruz, and 11 percent Kasich and Rubio.

Trump also grabs the (dubious) title when voters are asked which GOP candidate has made unfair attacks against fellow Republicans.

Nearly half, 47 percent, feel Trump has attacked other Republicans unfairly. Another 28 percent say the same of Cruz, 19 percent feel Rubio has attacked unfairly, and 17 percent say Bush. Carson (10 percent) and Kasich (12 percent) perform best on this measure, as fewer say they have attacked fellow Republicans unfairly. (Multiple responses were accepted.)

The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The telephone poll (landline and cellphone) was conducted February 15-17, 2016 with live interviewers among a random sample of 1,401 South Carolina voters selected from a statewide voter file. Results for the 759 likely Republican primary voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","[]"

Most Christians know enough about the Bible to be dangerous.

The Bible in America is a massive industry ($2.5 billion) yet it is the best seller few read and fewer understand.

The Bible has become a moving target. One can strip it down, twist it, misread it, add to it, supplement it, and even overrule it, and, unfortunately, 95 percent of the congregation will not realize it.

Why? Because Americans no longer know the Bible. The evidence is overpowering that contemporary Christianity is Bible-ish, at best, and at worst, in some cases, Bible-less.

The American Bible Society releases an annual State of the Bible report and their research is persuasive in understanding the declining influence of the Bible in America.

Everyone has an opinion about the Bible. Politicians attempt to use the Bible, Grammy-award winners quote it and Hollywood has portrayed it on the big screen.

Yet one problem remains: most are oblivious to the Bibles basic content, meaning, and message.

Across the pond, the results are even more dramatic: one-third of British parents thought Harry Potter was a thematic plotline derived from the Bible.

The Bible is not held in the esteem it once was. Over the last 150 years, America has drifted from its Biblical focus. In an election season, it is remarkable to recall that, though he was not a member of any church, the Bible was valued as an authority in America so much so that Abraham Lincoln quoted from it four strategic times in his second inaugural address on March 4, 1865. President Lincoln used words ascribed to Jesus in Matthew 18:7 and  using the Bible --- pronounced Gods judgment on our nation for her moral bankruptcy of slavery.

The unwillingness of many Americans to dig deeper into the Scriptures is not related to a lack of options. The Gideons give away a Bible every second. One publisher sells more than sixty different editions of the Bible.

Clearly, the challenge of biblical illiteracy in America is not because of a shortage of Bibles, but rather knowledge and appreciation of the Bibles message.

The Bible is a diverse love story. Actually, it is the greatest break-up-and-get-back together story the world has ever known.

The message of the Bible is that even though we are not what we should be, God loves us, redeems us, and has a purpose for our lives.

A tremendously exciting new initiative is underway to re-introduce the world to the Bible.

In 2017 the six-floor 430,000-square-foot Museum of the Bible will open only two blocks from the National Mall in Washington D.C. The Museum of the Bible invites all people  those with faith and those without  to engage with the Bible in an immersive experience with its unique history, narrative and influence.

Once one encounters the story of the Bibles history and preservation, the cost that was involved  and it was a terrible cost  one can never again open the Scriptures with the same detached, careless attitude.

The story of how the Bible has come to us is a tale of heroism, courage, persecution, betrayal and towering faith in a God who raises the dead, mixed through the centuries with the blood of martyrs. If 80 percent of Americans believe the Bible is Gods word, shouldnt we show the Bible some respect by knowing more about it?

Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday, Fox News projects, beating Bernie Sanders and breathing new life into her campaign just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

Though the victory appears to be a narrow one, Clinton is hoping the win will serve to undercut Sanders' momentum as they head next into several delegate-heavy contests.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.

With 66 percent of precincts reporting in Nevada, Clinton has 52 percent to Sanders' 48 percent.

The balloting in Nevada coincides with the Republican primary Saturday in South Carolina, where front-runner Donald Trump is hoping for a decisive win.

In Nevada, Clinton was looking to rebound after losing big to Sanders in the party's New Hampshire primary, and only narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses.

The candidates spent their final hours before the caucuses furiously trying to drive up turnout among their supporters.

Significant spending by Sanders on paid media and staff helped his campaign make inroads into the Latino and African-American communities, which make up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate in the state.

It wasn't enough to edge out Clinton. But each candidate benefited from a different set of constituencies.","[]"
"622","foxnews","2016-02-17 00:00:00","Why 10,000-plus sharks are hanging out in Florida waters","[]","Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 blacktip sharks are currently swimming off the Florida coast, but while these numbers may seem menacing, shark researchers say it's not unusual to see these animals  visible as tiny dark spots in aerial photos and video  in the area at this time of year.

These annual visitors are there to feed on fish and bask in warm coastal waters, according to Stephen Kajiura, a professor of biological sciences at Florida Atlantic University who conducts a survey of the migrating sharks every winter. And don't panic  these sharks typically have little interest in people, Kajiura told Live Science.

Visitors to those beaches could even catch a glimpse of the blacktips breaching, leaping out of the water ""like dolphins,"" Kajiura said.

Kajiura began surveying the blacktip sharks in 2011, counting them after they migrate to south Florida during the winter. He said these numbers are typical during the peak of the blacktips' winter sojurn in the area, which begins in mid-January and lasts until the end of March.

The sharks, which grow to about 6.5 feet (2 meters) in length, spend their summer months near Georgia and the Carolinas, where they mate and birth their pups, Kajiura said.

During their Florida stay, these colonies of blacktip sharks, so-named for the distinctive black markings on the tips of their dorsal fins and tails, gather in coastal waters stretching from Miami to Jupiter Inlet, covering a distance of about 80 miles (129 kilometers).

And the 10,000 to 12,000 estimate represents only the sharks that are visible in the narrow band of water about 660 feet (200 meters) from the shore, Kajiura said, and is ""a gross underestimate"" of how many sharks there are in total.

To conduct the surveys, Kajiura mounts a high-definition video camera and a digital still camera to point out the window of a small plane as it flies adjacent to the beach. He later downloads the stills and footage to count all the visible sharks in the water.

""We see lots more sharks on the other side of the plane, so there's a lot more out there that we're simply not counting in the survey,"" Kajiura told Live Science. ""We simply don't know how big this school is, how far it extends off into deeper water,"" he said.

But people have little to fear from these seasonal visitors, Kajiura added. They feed on small, shiny fish, so swimmers should avoid wearing reflective watches or jewelry that might be mistaken for the sharks' prey. And when the water is murky or when it's dark out, a shark may be more likely to confuse light signals from human movement with prey activity.

Otherwise, ""they're not curious types,"" Kajiura said, and as long as people exercise common sense and don't harass the sharks, the blacktips will likely just avoid them completely.

And lucky beachgoers might even catch a glimpse of the colony without ever entering the water.

""You can literally sit on the beach and you can watch the blacktips jumping and spinning and splashing back into the water,"" Kajiura said. ""They're not out to get you, you're not part of their diet, so you may as well go to the beach and enjoy the phenomenon.""

Researchers analyzed some 38,600 samples of illegal marijuanaincluding plant material, hashish, and hash oilseized by the DEA over the past 20 years, reports Live Science.

Not only did samples of a really potent type of marijuana, known as sinsemilla, increase from 2010 to 2014, but researchers found the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in samples jumped from 4% in 1995 to 12% in 2014; an earlier study in Colorado found some samples contained up to 30% THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in weed.

At the same time, the presence of cannabidiol (CBD)which is believed to have possible health benefitsdropped so that the THC level grew from 14 times the amount of CBD in 1995-era marijuana to 80 times the amount in 2014.

Lead author Mahmoud ElSohlywho helps supply high-quality marijuana to researchers through a program at Ole Miss, per the Oxford Eaglesays higher doses of THC bring a higher risk of negative health effects, including psychosis and panic attacks, while lower doses usually produce ""a pleasant feeling."" But why is more potent pot hitting the market? ElSohly explains marijuana users can develop a tolerance for THC so they need higher doses to get high.

Growers can also charge more for pot with extra THC. (Potent pot may cause concussion-like effects.)

The blunt-talking billionaire posted his second straight victory in South Carolina's Republican primary Saturday, ending any lingering doubts that he could transform his passionate supporters into voters. On the other side of the country, Hillary Clinton blunted concerns about her viability with a clear victory over Bernie Sanders in Nevada, the first state to test the Democrats' appeal among a racially diverse group of voters.

Trump, now the clear leader in the delegate race, cemented his standing as his party's favorite. No Republican in modern times has won New Hampshire and South Carolina and then failed to win the nomination. Having proven his mettle in South Carolina, Trump emerged well-primed for more winning as the primary heads toward a cluster of Southern states.

""It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious,"" Trump said of the rollicking presidential campaign. ""It's beautiful. When you win, it's beautiful.""

Though Trump's victory was vindication for political mavericks whose hunger for an outsider has defined this year's campaign, those fortunes didn't extend to Sanders. After winning the second contest in New Hampshire, the self-declared democratic socialist came up in short in Nevada, where Clinton collected the majority of delegates and told gleeful supporters that ""this one is for you.""

For Jeb Bush, it was the end of the line. His donors ready to bolt, the political scion dropped out of the race after failing to break into the top three.

Trump routed his rivals by capturing roughly one-third of the votes in South Carolina. Sen. Marco Rubio edged fellow freshman Sen. Ted Cruz for second place, according to complete but unofficial results. John Kasich shrugged off a weak performance in South Carolina, a conservative state the Ohio governor had largely written off.

From here, Republicans and Democrats swap places, with the GOP candidates preparing to face off Tuesday in Nevada and the Democrats four days later in South Carolina. The bigger prize comes a few days later, when a dozen states vote on March 1, with oodles of delegates up for grabs.

A string of victories for Clinton and Trump in those Super Tuesday contests would give them commanding leads in the delegate race, dampening prospects for their rivals to catch up. Already, Trump leads Republicans with 61 of the needed 1,237 delegates, while Clinton has 503 to Sanders' 70, including superdelegates who back the candidate of their choice.

When Trump jumped into the race eight months ago, most Republican leaders dismissed the real estate mogul, insisting the die-hards packing his amped-up rallies were fans, not real voters. Not anymore.

The biggest question facing Republicans now is whether those seeking to spoil a Trump nomination have simply run out of time. Both Cruz and Rubio hinted at their strategy for knocking him out as they addressed supporters after polls closed.

""We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump,"" said Cruz, the victor of the Iowa caucuses. ""If you are a conservative, this is where you belong because only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race.""

Rubio, the fresh-faced son of Cuban immigrants, has insisted he's the only Republican that can best Clinton or another Democrat with a voting public that's growing younger and more diverse. Having finally dispensed with Bush, he confidently told supporters in Columbia that ""this has become a three-person race.""

""This country is now ready for a new generation of conservatives to guide us into the 21st century,"" Rubio said, flanked by South Carolina's Indian-American Gov. Nikki Haley and African-American Sen. Tim Scott.

Clinton's victory was a relief for her campaign following her blowout loss in New Hampshire. She captured voters who said electability and experience were important to their vote, according to entrance polls Edison Research conducted for The Associated Press and TV networks. But in sign of Clinton's continuing vulnerability, Sanders did best with voters seeking someone caring and honest.

""We have come a very long way in nine months,"" Sanders said. He waxed optimistic that ""the wind is at our backs.""

Backed by a powerful network of small-dollar donors, Sanders has plenty of funds to stay in for months. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson vowed to keep campaigning despite lagging far behind his fellow Republicans.

But NASA said January stood out: The temperature was above normal by the highest margin of any month on record.

And January set another record: Arctic sea ice reached its lowest point for that ice-building winter month.

NASA said January 2016 was 2.03 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates temperatures differently, said last month was 1.87 degrees, which is the second biggest margin in history. NOAA said the greatest was this past December.

January's average global temperature was a record 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit, easily beating the old January record set in 2007, according to NOAA Records go back to 1880.

There were colder-than-normal patches in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in January, but they were overwhelmed by incredible ""off our chart"" warming in the Arctic region, according to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. Siberia, northwest Canada, and a lot of Alaska were at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, she said.

That heat was why there was record low sea ice in the Arctic for this time of year, when sea ice grows, Blunden said.

January Arctic sea ice averaged only 5.2 million square miles in January, which is 90,000 square miles below the previous record set in 2011, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's also 402,000 square miles  about the size of Texas and New Mexico, combined  less than the 30-year normal.

The string of nine consecutive record hot months matches June 1997 to February 1998, which was the last time Earth had a large El Nino. It is still behind the 10 straight months of record heat in 1944, Blunden said. It's likely we'll tie that record in February, she said.

The current El Nino  an occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather around the world and spikes global temperatures  is tied with 1997-1998 for the strongest on record, according to NOAA. And while it has been predicted to ease soon, it has not lessened yet, said NOAA Climate Prediction Center deputy director Mike Halpert.

NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt blamed the record heat mostly on man-made climate change, with an assist from El Nino.","[]"

Skulls of the fish known as Rhinconichthys were found in Colorado and the re-examination of a second one from Japan  which triples the numbers of species in the genus known to science and greatly expands their geographical range. Until now, the only fossils of this fish had been found in England.

The fish dates to 92 million years during the Cretaceous Period.

Based on our new study, we now have three different species of Rhinconichthys from three separate regions of the globe, each represented by a single skull, Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University, said of the species that have been named R. purgatoirensis and R. uyenoi. This tells just how little we still know about the biodiversity of organisms through the Earth's history. It's really mindboggling.

Rhinconichthys belongs to an extinct bony fish group called pachycormids, which contains the largest bony fish ever to have lived. Estimated to have been than 6.5 feet, its strangest feature might be the pair of bones called hyomandibulae that formed a massive oar-shaped lever to protrude and swing the jaws open extra wide, like a parachute.

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","[]"

Planning a trip is exciting, but it can also be exhausting. Whether its finding the best hotel deal, keeping track of booking information or getting directions to wherever youre going, there are a few easy-to-use resources that can cut down the stress.

Here are my five favorite travel resources, designed to make any vacation thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

1.&nbspHassle-Free Planning TripIt One of the most stressful parts of planning a trip is ensuring you have all your information  hotel address, car rental information, restaurant reservations, etc.  in one place. TripIt is one of the best tools available. Just input (or email) your booking information, and you get a detailed itinerary  generated entirely by TripIt  that is accurate and easy to access. Your itinerary can be as detailed as you want, and its easy to share with family and friends.

2.&nbspSimplified Currency Exchange The Converted When traveling abroad, trading your cash for foreign bills is a good way to get hustled. Currency rates at money exchange booths are notoriously bad, and theyre entirely avoidable in this digital age. Try The Converted, an app for iOS and Android smartphones. Its crisp and clear layout allows users to easily convert their own currency into the currency of the country theyre visiting. The exchange rates are updated daily, so it serves as a great baseline to make sure youre not getting swindled. The app is also great for converting units  a function that should prove especially handy for American travelers who arent familiar with the metric system.

3.&nbspNavigation Know-How Waze Whether traveling near or far, its always a good idea to have a navigational aid, and one of my favorites is Waze. This free, easy-to-use app is a huge boon whenever Im on a road Ive never driven before. Not only does Waze give navigational directions (including spoken turn-by-turn instructions), but it also processes information from other Waze users to calculate the worst traffic spots and provide the fastest, most efficient routes for getting around. It can add hours of vacation time that you might otherwise spend in traffic. Plus, you dont need to worry about where to fill up; Waze will direct you to nearby gas stations.

4.&nbspHotel Room Bookings from Your Fingertips Hotwire Booking hotels at the 11th hour can lead to some very steep discounts.

When Samsung ditched water-resistance and the inexpensive memory upgrade option on last years Galaxy S6 smartphones, a lot of consumers complained, even though the new phones had sleeker glass-and-aluminum cases and added convenient wireless and quick-charging options.

Enter the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. These models bring back the water-resistance and memory features while retaining their sleek cases and multi-charge conveniences. In fact, the Samsung S7 and S7 edge can dive deeper and accommodate larger-capacity memory cards (up to 200GB) than the S5, while their glass-and-metal cases have been given smoother, rounder edges to better fit in your hand.

The main camera is brand new, sporting a slightly larger image sensor and other hardware to make it, according to Samsung, ""twice as bright and four times as fast as the one in previous models. This despite sensor resolution stepping down from 16 to 12 megapixels.

Measuring up to Apple. Samsungs highly competitive relationship with Apple becomes quite apparent with the S7 smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S7, which measures 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.3 inches, is about the same height and width as the iPhone 6s, which has a 4.7-inch display. This is the form factor Samsung believes most people will buy. The phablet-sized S7 edge has a 5.5-inch display, which is closer to that of the iPhone 6s Plus, and measures 5.9 inches x 2.9 inches x 0.3 inches. It's geared toward users who appreciate the extra screen real estate for playing games and viewing multimedia. One significant Samsung advantage: Both new phones have quad HD displays that display their subjects with several times the resolution of either iPhone.

A camera that does more with less. Samsung says the Galaxy cameras megapixel downshift from 16 megapixels (5312 x 2988 pixels) to 12 megapixels (4032 x 2268 pixels) wont be missed once people take a gander at the results of the technologies it employed to improve image quality. First, its f/1.7 aperture (compared to f/1.9 on the S 6 models) lets in about twice as much light, allowing the camera to capture images with less noise at faster shutter speeds under low-light conditions. Its also the first camera to include phase-detect autofocus on every pixel site. The advantage of phase-detect auto-focus, a technology often found on SLRs and other high-end cameras, is that the camera can focus on objects almost instantaneously. Other smartphone cameras use a hybrid autofocus technology that may incorporate phase-detect autofocus, but these, according to Samsung, arent as fast or accurate.

Water resistance. Both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge meet the ip68 standard for dust and water resistance, which means they should be able to survive a 30-minute dunk in about 5 feet of water. Thats 2 feet deeper than where many other water-resistant smartphones can venture, including the venerable Galaxy S 5. Whats more, these Galaxies protect their ports and other openings without flaps that can get in the way or get lost. Samsung said a special nanocoating and strategically placed gaskets allow these phone to stay dry while keeping ports, jacks, and speaker holes open for business.

Upgradable memory. Samsung would probably like to forget the flack it received for dropping the upgradeable storage option with the Galaxy S6 redesign. Well, thats all forgotten because both the S7 and S7 edge have room for an extra slot on their SIM tray for a microSD memory cards with up to 200 gigabytes of capacity. On the European version of these phones, the extra slot can be used for a second SIM card, which allows the phones to handle two phone numbers.

Always-on display. With all the great things smartphones can do, the things most people use them for most often are to check the time, the date, the weather and app notifications. And you can set these Galaxies to continuously show these thing after the display goes to sleep. You can easily customize what the screen shows. For instance, you can have it just show you the time, or have it flash alternating views of the calendar, time, and app notifications.

Keeping what works. We quickly scanned the menus of the demo models to make sure these Samsungs kept some of the older, lower-profile features our engineers think improve the smartphone experience. And we were glad to see that Samsung kept its ergonomic five-row keyboard with cursor control, the ability to have several app windows open at once (Multi Window), and the Smart Stay feature that keeps the display from going to sleep while youre reading it. But there was one unfortunate casualty: Glove mode, which increases display sensitivity so that you can interact with it while wearing gloves.

Availablility. These Samsungs, which come with 32GB or 64GB of internal memory, will be available on all major U.S. carriers by April.

So why is it that the checkpoint youre in is always the one with the interminable line?

TSAs statistics are based on national averages, and theyre skewed somewhat by the fact that expedited screening lanes processed 44 percent of fliers in 2015. More than two million fliers have signed up for TSA PreCheck, those fast-pass lanes for travelers who pass a background check and pay a membership fee ($85 for five years). Others get line-cutting privileges via their airline.

But more than half of all travelers dont get any special treatment and when they hit a backed-up checkpoint, their wait can easily exceed 30 minutes. (The wait on what should have been a slow Wednesday morning at Newark Airport in mid-January took more than 40 minutes. I know: I clocked it as a family member was going through security at Terminal C.)

Why the security sluggishness? One reason is that the TSA is tightening the reins in the wake of terror attacks both here and abroad; several airlines, including United, do warn travelers to allow extra time ""as a result of heightened security measures at airports within the U.S.""

The big question for consumers, though, is whats going on at my local airport? J.D. Power, the consumer research firm, has taken a look at this side of travel in its 2015 North American Airport survey. While travelers perception of getting through security seems to have improved overall, with a 66 percent increase in its satisfaction score since the last survey in 2010, those without special privileges, understandably, have a lower opinion of how the TSA is doing.

Remember that individual airports may not have much direct control over security, which is, after all, a federal function. But airports see the benefits when their checkpoints operate more efficientlyin fact, the large airports that scored high on the efficiency of the checkpoint tended to do well overall in the survey. If travelers get through the lines quickly, they can use that extra time to enjoy the amenities on the other side. ""Time is money and airports with the higher scores tend to get the highest average spend,"" says Rick Garlick, Ph.D., head of J.D. Powers global travel and hospitality practice. Below are the average wait times at large and medium-sized U.S. airports, as reported by travelers surveyed by J.D. Power. Does this ring true to what you experience?

Best Wait Times at Large U.S. Airports

Tampa  11.4 minutes Fort Lauderdale  12.3 minutes San Diego  12.5 minutes Detroit  12.6 minutes Portland 12.8 minutes

Mid-sized airports tend to do even better, as their size makes for more manageable crowds: The best was Palm Beach airport, clocking in at just under ten minutes.

Worst Wait Times at Large U.S. Airports

JFK  16.8 minutes Newark  16.5 minutes LAX 16 minutes Philadelphia  15.6 minutes Seattle/Tacoma  15.6 minutes (tie) Chicago O'Hare 15.6 minutes (tie) LaGuardia  15.5 minutes Washington Dulles  15.5 minutes

But averages dont tell the whole story. The TSA doesnt post average wait times by airportalthough it used to years agoand instead maintains a crowd-sourced app that gives fliers the opportunity to post how long it took them to get through. Not surprisingly, most travelers are more interested in making their flight than taking the time to weigh ina recent check of wait-times at several major airports showed that days and even weeks can elapse between postings. That renders this service effectively useless for planning purposes, but still, the results are sobering: In half of the posted times in the past two weeks, the average wait exceeded 30 minutes at Newark; LaGuardia did a little better, with about a third waiting more than a half hour, another third from ten to 30 minutes, and the rest reporting no wait.

Browse NEW or USED cars for sale on driving.co.uk

According to the car maker, which is a subsidiary of Renault, the Alpine Vision is inspired by the Alpine A110 Berlinette of the 1960s and was revealed in the mountains around Monte Carlo where the company earned a reputation for rallying.

The mid-engined, two-seater blends styling cues from the A110 including quad front lights intended to recall that models array of lights, curvy styling incorporating a sloping roofline and sculpted sides. It sits on a lightweight chassis that Alpine claims is tuned for agility and perfectly suited to the twisting roads of the Southern French Alps.

Alpine claims that the concepts four-cylinder, turbocharged engine  it hasnt revealed its capacity but it is believed to be a 1.8-litre producing over 220bhp, and shared with the Clio RenaultSport  will launch the car from 0-62mph in less than 4.5 seconds.

The interior of the Alpine Vision looks impressively complete and finished for a concept car. It features bucket seats, lashings of quilted leather and aluminium detaling but its the quality of the cabin architecture and the dashboard that suggest this concept could provide more than a glimpse of the real car.

The centre console rests on a prominent, leather-trimmed aluminium structure that appears unsupported and features the control wheel for the cars multimedia touchscreen system, and the engine start button.

Meanwhile, the fascia incorporates a customisable TFT instrument display, presumably similar to the system in the Audi TT, below a carbon cowling.

For all that the Alpine Vision is billed as a concept car, the car maker says the eventual production model will be very close to it in terms of design, weight, handling, agility and attention to detail.

Alpine has set itself just 12 months to achieve these goals during which time, it says, it will create a dealer network and, to help re-establish the brands sporting credentials, build on its recent race achievements which, last year, saw the Signatech-Alpine racing team score two Endurance Championship victories. This year it will enter two Alpine LMP2 cars in the World Endurance Championship, including Le Mans.

The Alpine Vision concept will be revealed to the public at next months Geneva show before the production car is unmasked late this year. It will go on sale in 2017.

Alpine has yet to reveal a price for the car but admits it will be a niche model produced in limited volumes, meaning it could start at around 40,000. The company says it is considering extending the range with more powerful versions that will follow later.

The suit claims that (in a similar vein to GEs infamous annual house cleaning, made famous under Jack Welch) Yahoos methodology is more of a Draconian measure for making large staff cuts than a process for evaluating and enhancing human performance.

Continue Reading Below

There is no doubt the annual review has become more of a check-the-box obligation that both managers and employees begrudgingly endure. The problem with the traditional performance review is that it is very backward looking, and encourages managers to defer conversations about performance until its too late.

So, this begs the question: What is the purpose of the annual (or quarterly for that matter) performance review, and what should be the purpose?

First lets take a look at what the purpose IS.

The annual performance review is one of the oldest business processes in America and is rooted in the industrial age and the rise of unions, according to Jason Averbook, CEO of TMBC. Originally the annual review was about justifying adjustments in compensation and had little to do with enhancing performance. He argues that its an archaic method that has outlived its usefulness.

Mike Ettling, president HR Line of Business at SAP, agrees.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

I believe many executives are in a license to kill [the annual review] moment, says Ettling, adding that many organizations are taking notice.

And now well focus on what the purpose should be.

Ettling says the performance review should be about facilitating a quality dialogue between two people. It should be a conversation about what went well, and where there are opportunities to enhance performance moving forward. And the experts agree this isnt a conversation that can happen just once a year. As Averbook put it, if you are trying to lose weight you dont weigh yourself once a year.

Listen with Purpose

Just last week IBM introduced a newly overhauled performance review system that has been in the works since last year -- the overhaul was heavily guided by listening to the companys employees. I had the opportunity to speak to Carrie Altieri, IBMs Vice President of Communications - HR Initiatives, about the move.

Like every other company, we had a standard yearly appraisal with a single rating that defined your year, Altieri said. It just wasnt helpful because people are too rich to be boiled down to a single number.

The executive team felt that a dramatic change was in order, but it needed to come from the employees. So, the IBM human resources team reached out to employees to understand what they needed, so as to custom create a system that would work for them. The outreach included moderated online debates, virtual chats, polling, pulse surveys and social media.

Altieri points out that its not enough that you give people a vehicle to voice opinions, you have to actually follow-through with action. That action came last week with the unveiling of a new and deliberately fluid process that is employee driven. Employees have the ability to request feedback sessions as frequently as they feel needed (quarterly at a minimum), and also rate the quality and value of the feedback they receive, so as to help managers learn and grow as coaches. They are also providing training to managers based on this feedback.

The new program also includes an app that allows employees to solicit feedback from teammates. Just as for many companies today, much of IBMs work is project and team based, so getting feedback from those who actually had the experience of working with you is highly valuable. Thus far, 70,000 employees have downloaded the app, according to Altieri.

Moving From Check-the-Box to Quality Talks

Even with the best of intentions the purpose of evaluating performance often gets lost in the mechanics of the process. Consider that Deloitte discovered they were spending roughly two million hours a year on annual performance appraisals, an incredible burden on time and the bottom line.

Managers need to be coaches and they need to view managing performance as an ongoing process as opposed to a rare event. Effective coaches are constantly observing behavior and providing light touch suggestions for making positive change. Great coaches also spend time catching their people doing things right and letting them know it! Positive reinforcement is incredibly powerful when it is timely and authentic. Any system with the true purpose of enhancing and celebrating performance must run the gamut from light daily touches to regular formal conversations that focus on making positive change.

Merit Requires Measurement, Smart Measurement

Ultimately performance must tie to pay. In a capitalist society you have to differentiate between the type and level of contributions people make otherwise you lapse into a socialist system of equal pay for showing up. As Altieri explained we are a pay for performance company so metrics are important, its a matter of having the right metrics around both the what and how of performance.

Averbook points out that we live in a world where everything is rated. Being rated is the norm in our culture. Whether its rating your Uber driver (they rate you too by the way), evaluating a restaurant on Yelp, or liking a post on Facebook -- we are a ratings-based society. Its about the credibility of those ratings that realty matter. As Averbook notes, just as you wouldnt use the Body Mass Index (BMI) as a single indictor of your health, you shouldnt use a single manager rating as an indicator of employee performance.

Ettling believes the data has to be from a credible source and the ones doing the ratings and conducting the reviews need to be the ones who have the most exposure to their actual performance. Team leaders with direct responsibility, not managers who are separated by levels and locations, must be the ones to provide feedback, make the ratings and provide positive support. That feedback must be timely, authentic and constructive.","[]"

God bless dad for his faith, said the Rev. Paul Scalia, one of Justice Scalia's nine children, who led the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The deeper he went in his faith, the better public servant he was. God bless dad for his love of his family.

The roughly two-hour-long service was attended by such leaders in government and law as Vice President Joe Biden, former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 95-year-old retired Justice John Paul Stevens and the remaining eight high court justices.

Among them were Justice Clarence Thomas who read from the New Testament.

There was no eulogy in a service free of bipartisan politics.

However, the Rev. Scalia, a Catholic priest serving the diocese of Arlington, Va., shared some personal moments from his fathers life.

Scalia said his father once unknowingly stood in his line to confess sins, a Roman Catholic sacrament.

 Like heck Im confessing to you,  Scalia recalled his father later saying. The feeling was mutual.

Scalia, 79, died unexpectedly last weekend at a remote Texas ranch. He had spent nearly three decades on the high court.

The service, which began on an overcast day, concluded with the funeral procession headed to a private burial amid sunlight breaking through a grey sky.

Scalias flag-draped casket was brought to the church Saturday morning, in a short trip from the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Scalia's other sons and his sons-in-law served as pallbearers, carrying the casket into and out of the basilica, the countrys largest Roman Catholic church.

In additon to Scalia's wife of 55 years and their nine children and dozens of grandchildren, other dignitaries at the service included members of Congress and several federal judges who are considered possible replacements for Scalia. Among them were Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett and Chief Judge Merrick Garland, all of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Obama did not attend, despite criticism from some Republicans.

However, the president and first lady Michelle Obama were among the more than 6,000 people who paid tribute to Scalia at the Supreme Court building on Friday. His casket rested on a funeral bier that first held President Abraham Lincoln's casket after his assassination.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama's decision about the Mass was a ""respectful arrangement"" that took into account his large security detail.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, who also participated in the service, acknowledged the Scalia familys desire for a simple, parish-family mass, as much as possible.

Scalias unexpected death has touched off a sharp debate in Washington and across the country about whether Obama should nominate a replacement in his final roughly 10 months of office and whether he would attempt to make recess appointment -- appoint somebody to the high court while Congress is in recess over the extended Presidents Day weekend or during future recesses.

Republicans and others say the next president, who takes office in January 2017, should submit the nomination to the Congress.

GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz interrupted his campaign ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary to attend the Mass.

The Texas senator has been among those urging the Senate not to consider replacing Scalia until after the November election.

The GOP-led Senate is not expected to approve any appointment by Obama, who said after Scalias death he would make a consideration in time due.

Obama said Tuesday that he would not make a recess appointment full stop. But he said he would nominate somebody who would be indisputably qualified and whom any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

Never before had a funeral for a Supreme Court justice been held at the basilica. Three popes have visited the basilica: Pope John Paul II in 1979, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 and Pope Francis last year.

Jason Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper. Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations, police said.

A Michigan prosecutor said authorities were investigating a Facebook post that indicated Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he was aware of the post, but was not prepared to discuss it.

Dalton lived just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.

Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said investigators contacted Dalton's wife Saturday evening ""to make sure she wasn't a victim."" Hadley added that she's cooperated with police in their investigation.

Law enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt.

Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

He described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where the woman was shot and seriously wounded.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said.

Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree incomprehensible, according to Fox 17 Online.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.

Izaha Akins, of Marion, visited Mohawk High School in December and claimed to be a lawmaker who was going to replace another senator who was planning on resigning due to an illness. Akins told the school he was second in line for the appointment after the first choice declined, according to The Toledo Blade. He also gave a speech to students.

School officials realized they were duped weeks later after Sen. David Burke, of Marysville, showed up to speak weeks later, as scheduled. Burke told the Associated Press in an email Friday that when he learned about the hoax, he and the high school immediately began working with police.

Akins told The Toledo Blade he wanted to make a point about school security in small communities.

""These country schools think it can't happen to them,"" Akins told The Blade in a brief interview. He said he wanted to ""prove a point  that these kinds of things can happen. They could easily have Googled me, and they didn't.""

School officials said Burke was scheduled to speak to a class at Jan. 14 when Akins called to tell them he was his replacement. He arranged to visit Dec. 15, provided his real name, presented his drivers license at the school that afternoon, got a tour of the school from the principal, then gave his presentation and left, Mohawk Schools Superintendent Ken Ratliff said.

""The presentation was about being active in politics, political processes,"" Ratliff said. ""Everyone thought it was legit; bought into it, including the teacher.""

Authorities said Reineke Ford provided a car and driver for the day to the supposed legislator. The Blade said Reineke Motors general manager Tony Flood said it's not unusual for the dealership to help the nearby school district.

Wyandot County Sheriff Mike Hetzel said no one at the school was in any danger, and a sheriff's deputy was at the school during the time of the visit.

Ratliff said, though, that the district now takes extra steps to verify visitors' identities.

The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is designed to help researchers unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the universe, according to NASA. It also will discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life, explained the space agency, in a statement released Thursday.

NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is leading the WFIRST mission, with the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. managing the 7.8 foot telescope. The Jet Propulsion Lab will also deliver the cornograph, which helps image and characterize planets around stars.

""WFIRST has the potential to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe, much the same way Hubble has,"" said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at its headquarters in Washington. ""This mission uniquely combines the ability to discover and characterize planets beyond our own solar system with the sensitivity and optics to look wide and deep into the universe in a quest to unravel the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter.""

The new telescope will survey large parts of the sky in near-infrared light, according to NASA, answering questions about the evolution of the universe and broadening our knowledge about exoplanets situated outside our solar system.

""WFIRST is designed to address science areas identified as top priorities by the astronomical community,"" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's Astrophysics Division in Washington, in the statement. ""The Wide-Field Instrument will give the telescope the ability to capture a single image with the depth and quality of Hubble, but covering 100 times the area. The coronagraph will provide revolutionary science, capturing the faint, but direct images of distant gaseous worlds and super-Earths.""

"653","foxnews","2016-02-21 00:00:00","Warriors ride hot shooting to 115-112 victory over Clippers","[]","LOS ANGELES (AP) The Golden State Warriors rebounded from their biggest loss of the season with a dominating shooting performance.

Klay Thompson scored 32 points, fellow Splash Brother Stephen Curry added 23 and the Warriors shot 51 percent in beating the Los Angeles Clippers 115-112 on Saturday night to avoid losing back-to-back games for the first time this season.

''I was just proud of the way we responded from the jump, especially after letting (Portland's) best player go for 50 last night,'' Thompson said. ''We had to give some back. We were out to prove a point that last night was a fluke.''

The Warriors were coming off a 32-point drubbing at Portland a night earlier that snapped their 11-game winning streak. They appeared highly motivated to erase that memory from the opening tip, shooting 56 percent in the first half and twice leading by 15 points in the second quarter.

''We can have a letdown night like last night, but we come back and refocus, and turn it on and find a way to get a win against a great team that's been playing well the last 20 or so games,'' Curry said. ''With the short turnaround, we didn't want to have any excuses coming into tonight, and we got it done.''

Draymond Green had his NBA-leading 11th triple-double with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to help the defending champions improve to 49-5.

Jamal Crawford scored 25 points off the bench, Chris Paul added 24 and DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 21 rebounds for the Clippers. They fell to 19-6 without injured Blake Griffin. Their two earlier losses to the Warriors were by a combined 11 points with Griffin in the lineup.

''They're sort of becoming like San Antonio, they're not going to beat themselves,'' said Paul, whose thigh bruise got him pulled with 8:09 remaining. ''We had a few bad stretches. We know we have to be better and we will be.''

The Clippers were coming off a 19-point win over San Antonio on Thursday night. Even with a day of rest, they played behind nearly the entire game.

''Tonight was a good response to a great challenge because the Clippers have been playing really well and they're a great team,'' Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ''On the road, after a long flight, that's a great win.''

Pablo Prigioni's 3-pointer off Wesley Johnson's steal left the Clippers trailing 115-112 with five seconds to go, long after both teams' best players had gone to the bench. That brought Thompson, Curry, Green and Harrison Barnes back in a hurry.

Andre Iguodala's pass was stolen by C.J. Wilcox, but his desperation 3-pointer to tie fell well short of the basket as time expired.

The game was rarely as close as the final score.

The Clippers again trailed by 15 early in the third when they briefly matched the Warriors basket-for-basket during a furious scoring stretch to close within five on a dunk by Jordan off Crawford's alley-oop pass. Jordan threw down some highlight dunks that had fans roaring and Crawford scored on a one-handed scoop shot, getting fouled as he crashed to the floor and making the free throw for the three-point play.

''It was a horrible offensive night that created a horrible defensive night,'' Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ''We were impatient. We wanted to win the game so badly we were in our own way.''

The Warriors' shooting percentage dipped - barely - to 50 percent in the third when Curry missed a few shots and got called for traveling. The Clippers' defense couldn't stifle them, either from the perimeter or inside. Curry hit a 3-pointer with Paul in his face, and Green caught an inbounds pass from Iguodala in traffic at the basket and scored.

Curry was fouled on a 3-pointer and made two of three before Green's layup kept the Warriors ahead 93-84 going into the fourth.

Golden State went up 14 points early in the fourth on consecutive baskets by Barnes and later stretched it to 18 points on a 7-0 run that included Barnes' second 3 of the quarter.

TIP-INS

Warriors: Green had a technical in the first quarter. ... The Warriors improved to 25-5 on the road. ... C Andrew Bogot sat out with a strained right Achilles. ... F James Michael McAdoo missed his 22nd straight game because of a sprained toe on his left foot. ... After Curry got fouled on a 3-pointer and missed one of his free throws, a fan shouted, ''Why don't you make everything?''

Clippers: J.J. Redick, who finished with 16 points, and Paul each got technicals 67 seconds apart in the second quarter. ... The Clippers signed F-C Alex Stepheson to a 10-day contract. The 28-year-old former USC player was averaging 15.9 points, 13.8 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 31 games for the Iowa Energy of the NBA's D-League this season. Stepheson, who is 6-foot-10, has played overseas since failing to be drafted in 2011. ''He has the gift of a being a big that plays with energy,'' Rivers said. ... Rapper Kendrick Lamar was on hand in the same arena where he won five Grammys last Monday. Beyonce and Jay Z, Floyd Mayweather, comic Adam Sandler, Northern Trust Open third-round leader Bubba Watson, ''Grease'' actress Keke Palmer and former Clipper Baron Davis also attended.

GREEN VS JORDAN

With Bogut sidelined, Green started at center against Jordan, giving up four inches and 35 pounds to the Clippers' big man.

''He gets up for every kind of matchup. You see the passion he plays with,'' Thompson said. ''No matter who he's guarding, he's the most versatile defender I've ever seen. We packed in our defense and were able to switch a lot.''

The Clippers controlled the boards, 49-39, but were outclassed in the paint (58-46) and on fast-break points (32-19).

Now, more than 70 years after Pfc. Thomas E. Davis was killed in the war's final battle, a tangible reminder of her beloved sibling has been found on the Pacific island of Saipan  one of his Army dog tags.

Related Image Expand / Contract World War II Pfc. Thomas E. Davis survived bloody fighting on Saipan only to die during the battle for Okinawa nearly a year later. (Courtesy David Hollingsworth via AP)

""He was a great guy,"" said Hollingsworth, 82, who lives outside Dayton, Ohio, noting that some of her earliest memories are of the tall, thin sibling 17 years her senior who always sat next to her at the dinner table. ""He was always laughing and singing and whistling.""

Cultural historian Genevieve Cabrera told The Associated Press in an email that she found the discolored metal tag sticking out of the soil of a farm field on Saipan in early 2014. It was embossed with Davis' name, serial number, hometown and other information.

Cabrera recently gave the tag to members of Kuentai, a Japan-based organization that has found the remains of five 27th Division soldiers on Saipan. The group notified the AP this month about the dog tag's discovery in the hope that his relatives could be found. The AP tracked down members of the soldier's family with the help of Anthony Barger, the archivist for the Putnam County Public Library.

Kuentai representatives said they'll arrange to meet the Davis family in the U.S. to hand over the tag.

While it is relatively common to find canteens, weapons and even unexploded shells from the 100,000 Americans and Japanese who fought for 25 days on the 46-square-mile island, dog tags remain a rare find, Cabrera said. The tags, attached to a chain worn around the neck, were the only item of military-issued gear a soldier wore daily that included potentially life-saving information such as blood type and when a tetanus shot was administered.

A year before Davis died in the battle for Okinawa in April 1945, he earned one of the nation's highest military honors after surviving the bloody fighting on Saipan.

According to wartime records kept at the New York State Military Museum, home to many of the 27th Division's documents, Davis earned the Silver Star on Saipan in June 1944 for risking his own life to rescue a wounded comrade ""at a time when the American front was undergoing brutal Japanese artillery and mortar fire.""

Davis went into the Army in September 1941, three months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor drew the U.S. into WWII. He served in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division, a New York National Guard unit mobilized into active service in 1940.

Davis was with the 27th when it took part in the Okinawa invasion, which began on April 1, 1945. Three weeks later, he was shot by a Japanese sniper while again helping a wounded soldier, according to what Hollingsworth says military officials told the family. Davis died April 30, two months shy of his 28th birthday. Four years later, his body was brought back for reburial in his hometown.

Davis was born and raised on his family's farm in Roachdale in Putnam County, Indiana, 30 miles west of Indianapolis. His mother died when he was a young boy, and his father remarried. Davis had six siblings: an older brother, Harold, three half brothers and two half sisters, including Hollingsworth. The brothers have died. His other half-sister, Hazel Priest, 81, lives in Victoria, Texas, and several nieces and nephews live in Texas, Ohio and Indiana.

Hollingsworth said Tom Davis, of Victoria, a 57-year-old machinist who was named after his uncle, will likely get the dog tag.

The new study, published in the journal Nature, reports that genetic analysis of the remains of a Neanderthal woman detected residual DNA from Homo sapiens, a sign of inter-species mating.

The discovery by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology forces scientists to reasses the accepted timeline of when humans migrated out of Africa to other parts of the world.

One theory is that the recently discovered interbreeding arose from what scientists call a failed dispersal. That refers to a small population of Homo sapiens trekking to the Middle East and other parts of Eurasia, but failing to establish lasting colonies.

The remains of the Neanderthal woman at the center of the study were found in southern Siberia, near the border with present-day Mongolia.

We don't know what happened to them,"" geneticist Martin Kuhlwilm told Reuters. ""It seems likely that this population went extinct, either by environmental changes or maybe direct competition with Neanderthals ... It implies that modern humans left Africa in several waves, some of which probably went extinct.""

Neanderthals, renowned for their skill as hunters, lived in modern-day Europe and Asia. The last of them are believed to have died out approximately 40,000 years ago.

Last week, a study published in the journal Science presented evidence that one bit of Neanderthal DNA can boost the risk of tobacco addiction, while others can slightly raise or lower the risk of being diagnosed with depression. Past studies have suggested Neanderthal DNA raises the risk of allergies.

Neanderthals and modern people split off from each other on the evolutionary tree an estimated 600,000 years ago. In people of Asian or European ancestry, around 2 percent of DNA can be traced to Neanderthals.

The new Brooklyn Nets GM, who was hired away from the San Antonio Spurs earlier this week, made his first move Saturday when the team waived forward Andrea Bargnani. Next might be star Joe Johnson, who's making $24.9 million this season and has been rumored to be interested in signing with Cleveland if Brooklyn buys him out, too.

Bargnani, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2006 draft, had been a bust since signing with Brooklyn in July, averaging just 6.6 points while the Nets have gone 15-40, the second-worst record in the East. At least he wasn't an expensive bust -- the 30-year-old Italian signed for the veteran's minimum after two disappointing seasons with the Knicks.

In New York, Bargnani failed to achieve the success he had in Toronto, where he spent his first seven seasons, averaging 15.2 points. Injuries played a big role -- he's missed 200 games since 2011.

I use Windows 10 and OS X interchangeably on a variety of new PC laptops and MacBooks. While Im not going to make a blanket claim that one operating system is better than the other, I will say that OS X, in my experience, is the more stable of the two.



Arguably, Apple is better able to control the operating environment because it designs both the hardware and software. That said, here are a few (recent) Windows 10 pet peeves that can make it a more challenging OS to use day to day compared to OS X. Note that ""Windows"" in the context of this article does not necessarily imply Microsoft, as software issues can be attributed to software created by third-party software developers, the PC maker, or Microsoft.

Windows System hangs: a host of small annoyances like system slowdowns due to seemingly trivial software issues are nothing new to Windows users. One example of a quirk thats been particularly irksome for me is a right-click freeze. This happened on two late-model (new) PCs from two different top-tier PC makers  which means its a Windows problem, not a hardware problem. In short, if I right-clicked on the Windows desktop, I would get the spinning busy blue circle. This had the (very annoying) effect of hanging  i.e., slowing down  everything. It was a show-stopper for me. After some research, I solved this by diving into the Windows Registry (on both laptops) and making changes. But thats not something the average user will do.



Windows Processes weirdness: there are just too many examples to even begin to cover them all here. So, Ill focus on a very recent one that shows how a rogue process can cripple your system. One afternoon, all of the browsers I had open (Google Chrome, Firefox, and the Microsoft Edge browser) suddenly stopped loading pages. After being completely befuddled for a couple of hours, I decided to glance at the Windows 10 Task Manager under the Processes tab - I noticed that the CPU usage was maxing out  bouncing around between 98 percent and 100 percent, without falling back down into normal ranges. This is a red flag if youre doing relatively undemanding tasks. I solved it by isolating the problem process and disabling it. This immediately got the CPU percentage back to normal levels and all Web pages began loading normally. But it was time consuming to fix. And is your average user going to be able to figure something like this out? I wonder.



Microsoft Edge browser: while I was optimistic at first about the Edge browser, it has not worn well for me. Ive stopped (except on rare occasions) using it because it can't be used on other operating systems (just Windows 10) like Chrome and Firefox can.

Because I had already fixed two of the issues mentioned above on my own, I focused on the Edge browser.

And OS X? While its not flawless, I just spent more than a month using a new MacBook, pretty much all day every day. It was a relatively problem-free experience compared to Windows 10. Ironically, the only consistent, thorny problem I had on OS X was with Microsofts OneDrive (Microsofts file hosting service) for OS X. (I also have had show-stopping problems with OneDrive on Windows 10 -- but I won't go into that here.)



Let me repeat, OS X is not flawless  it has its own gotchas as any operating environment does. And Windows is indispensable for running many critical business applications  not to mention gaming. But, for me, reliability is really important, if not paramount. And in that department OS X is the clear winner.

A paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience Monday identifies a period from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age, spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere.

The research highlights key climactic changes that began around 1500 years ago, significantly impacting history. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil, it explained. The studys authors cited, for example, the Justinian plague that ravaged the Byzantine Empire, the Sasanian Empire in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region in 541 and 542 AD.

Related: Climate change didn't force Vikings to abandon Greenland, scientists say

The researchers also identified movements out of the Asian Steppe and the Arabian peninsula, as well as the spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China as the result of a cooler climate.

The studys lead author Ulf Buntgen is head of the Dendroecology Group at the Swiss Federal Institute. Dendroecology is the scientific study of tree rings.

Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia, explained the scientists, in their paper. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD.

Related: Early man's actions caused global warming, study says

By spewing sulfur, volcanic eruptions can increase reflection of solar radiation back into space, cooling the Earths atmosphere. The cooling temperatures following the sixth-century eruptions were probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, according to the researchers.

Scientists are using climate to gain insight into key periods in history.

Last year, for example, a report published in the journal Science Advances challenged the long-held theory that Vikings settled on Greenland during warmer temperatures during the so-called Medieval Warm Period. Researchers analyzed chemical isotopes in boulders that were left by advancing glaciers over the last 1,000 years in Southwestern Greenland and nearby Baffin Island.","[]"

"673","foxnews","2016-02-12 00:00:00","How Russia controls American policy","[]","Weve seen this movienow playing in Syria-- before.

The Russians have developed a way of getting the U.S. formally to permit offensive Russian military operations against American partners on the ground, all the while calling it a ceasefire.

What the Russians are proposing in Syriaa cessation of hostilities on terms they get to define-- is exactly what they have been doing in Eastern Ukraine for more than a year.

The Minsk II accords, signed in February 2015 between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, with the U.S. in support, supposedly established a cessation of hostilities across all of Ukraine. But Russian proxies on the ground, with active Russian support, have continued to attack Ukrainian positions while loudly blaming the Ukrainians for violating the ceasefire.

Then as now, humanitarian concerns were a prime motive. The West thought the Ukraine ceasefire would keep pro-Russian forces from seizing the town of Debaltseve, then under siege. But Russian proxies took Debaltseve three days after the ceasefire came into effect.

Putin will use exactly the same techniques in Syria to achieve a similar objectivethe weakening or destruction of opposition forces the U.S. has been supporting.

This matters, because Aleppo is one of the last few bastions for opposition groups that offers any hope of a future Syria that is neither brutally oppressed by Assad nor controlled by Al Qaeda and/or ISIS.

The Russians, of course, claim that all of the groups in northern Syria are al Qaeda or ISIS or their allies.

That claim is a lie.

The opposition in Aleppo includes groups that the U.S. has been supporting. Several of those groups have received TOW missiles from the U.S., indicating that they have passed a rigorous vetting process designed to ensure that those weapons will not end up in the hands of ISIS and al Qaeda.

The Russian false claim that it is fighting terrorists is a cynical device to conceal Putins real aim, which is to re-establish the vicious dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in order to guarantee Russias possession of air and naval bases on the Mediterranean littoral.

What will happen next?

Heres a version of the worst case. Syrian forces, heavily supported by Lebanese Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias, and Iranian troops, still backed by extensive Russian air strikes, will continue their offensive operations around Aleppo, further isolating the opposition in that city and expanding the Assad regimes control.

They will also continue to strike civilian targets in the area, creating additional tens of thousands of internally-displaced people and increasing the refugee flow to Turkey.

Secretary Kerry will no doubt launch strong protests with the Kremlin over this issue, but the Obama Administration will take no other action.

The regime will thus complete its encirclement of Aleppo and proceed to the destruction of the groups the U.S. has been supporting--all in the name of a process that the U.S. has just agreed to.

The net result will be the further weakening of any moderate opposition the U.S. could work with and the strengthening of Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their allies.

For one thing, these military operations will disproportionately damage the remaining opposition without striking areas that sustain ISIS and al Qaeda in Syria.

For another, they will powerfully reinforce the claims made by ISIS and Al Qaeda that the U.S. has thrown in completely with Assad and will support the dictators efforts to crush the Sunni population, and that ISIS and Al Quaeda alone are the Sunni defenders.

In this way, the Russians will make their lies come true.

We have watched the Russians execute this playbook in Ukraine for more than a year. The Russians have actually published descriptions of how they manipulate the West in precisely this fashion and that they have made it their policy to do so.

Manipulating the U.S. to support Russias aims is, in fact, Putins primary goal and purpose.

It is astonishing that anyone who has participated in this scenario in Ukraine over the last year could imagine that the outcome will be different in Syria this time.

And yet, at Foggy Bottom and in the White House, they apparently do.

Thats sort of the the idea behind the new LG G5, which has an ammo-clip-style removable bottom that allows you to swap in new audio or camera hardware in just a few seconds. This isnt as dramatic as the modular phone proposed by Google's Project Ara, whose every part can exchanged like Lego blocks. But it does offer an intriguing portal in which LG and third-party accessory makers can introduce significant, hardware-based upgrades that go beyond the traditional battery replacements and wireless charging options.

This modular design is just one of the compelling new features on LGs latest update to the flagship G series announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.

Here are the details on the new LG G5.

A new look and feel. The G5, which trades in the mildly elastic, plastic-backed design of its G-series predecessors for a sleeker, unibody glass-and-aluminum body, has a dual-lens camera for handling zoom shots with greater clarity.

The LG G5 is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor that promises 64-bit performance and has an integrated X12 modem that supports LTE download speeds of up to 600 megabits per second (Mbps). Thats lots of oomph, but it's a bit wasted on many customers, because in the United States the LTE download speeds of the major carriers are only about 10Mbps.

The G5 is virtually the same size as the G4, measuring 5.9 inches x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, but it has a smaller display (5.3 inches vs. 5.5 inches). Its quad HD resolution is the same (2560x1440 pixels) as the previous phone's, which means it presents photos, videos, and web pages with more than 500 pixels per inch of detail.

Easy and elegant accessory upgrades. Unlike the clunky aftermarket accessories that can make your phone look like a failing science project, the swappable modules on the LG G5 look like they're a natural part of the phone, as if that's how the phone came from the factory. And they might as well be factory components because they plug directly into the phone's core systems. What's more, they open the door to new speakers, data ports, physical controls and other improvements that would otherwise require the purchase of a new phone.

Case in point is the LG Cam Plus camera module option that will launch with the new LG G5. It comes with dedicated buttons for operating the shutter, flash, and zoom functions as well as an 1,100mAh battery that the phone will use first, before accessing the primary 2,800mAh battery.

Another module is the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O (Bang & Olufsen) PLAY, which LG says Bang & Olufsen helped engineer, to improve the audio quality of music, whether the files are on the phone, or streamed from external files such as a PC. In addition to the 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC upsampling technology (also on the LG V10) that purportedly adds depth to marginal-quality music, this module supports high-definition audio playback. It can be used either as a module with the LG G5 or as a separate Hi-Fi audio component by connecting it to any smartphone or PC. The module has its own headphone jack.

LG says more modules are on the way.



Wide-view camera. Its a fact that telescoping zoom lenses generally produce better images than digital-zoom schemes, which only magnify images that may not be that good in the first place. But theyre bulky, so you wont find them on most smartphones except, perhaps, on the Asus Zoom smartphone we saw at CES 2016, which cleverly squeezes one into its interior.

The main 16-megapixel camera on the LG G5 addresses the zoom challenge using two lenses: One has a 78-degree viewing angle for tight shots, while the other has a 135-degree viewing angle to capture more of whats happening on the periphery. (LG says the viewing angle of the 135-degree lens is about 1.7 times wider than those of existing smartphone cameras and 15 degrees wider than the human eyes field of view, which means the camera will capture scenery youd normally miss.) The camera automatically switches between them as you zoom in and out of a shot. This feature seemed to work well with still photos. What remains to be seen is how smooth the zoom transitions when you're shooting movies.

The camera also has a setting to automatically snap a picture as soon as its circuitry detects your subjects' faces.



Quick-charge battery. A 24-hour plus battery life is one of the G-series' great strengths, reached with the assistance of the phones' capacious 3,000mAh batteries. Alas, the G5s battery 2,800mAh battery holds less energy, but LG assured us it will still provide at least a full day of talk time. Our engineers, of course, will check this claim. The battery does support rapid charging, which LG says means the phone can be full charged 27 percent faster than earlier models could.

Always-on display. The LG G5 display has an always-on feature that shows the time, date, and battery status continuously when the display goes to sleep. Though not an must-have feature, this could could spare you from rudely handling your phone during a meeting to check on such things.

Availability. The LG G5 is expected to launch at all the major carriers this spring. It will come in silver, titanium, gold, and pink finishes. No info yet on pricing.

Well have more on this exciting phone in the coming weeks.

Brewers manager Craig Counsell said Sunday that Braun will switch this spring from right field to his former position.

Braun spent two seasons in right field after moving over from left. The slugger was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2007 as a third baseman.

Counsell said the shift will benefit both the 2011 NL MVP and the team.

""We talked it over and discussed it, and I think with the players that we have on our roster this year, it's an advantageous decision for both Ryan and the players we have involved,"" Counsell said on the first day Milwaukee pitchers and catchers officially reported to camp.

Despite having to survive a late scare against the 18th-placed club, Barca came away from the Canary Islands with three points, thus boosting their La Liga lead over Atletico Madrid to nine points with 13 games remaining in the season.

Las Palmas came out determined to move forward against its more talented rival, but Barcelona dissected the hosts' defense to open the scoring in the sixth minute.

On the play, Jordi Alba broke free down the left side and sent a perfectly placed cross to Suarez, who beat goalkeeper Javi Varas to the ball and tapped it home at close range.

But the lead was short-lived.

Just four minutes later, Jonathan Viera received a pass from Tana and back-heeled it to Willian Jose, who pushed away Dani Alves to get free in the area and then knocked the ball into the back of the net past Barca net minder Claudio Bravo.

Barcelona then tried to execute its intricate passing game against a sea of yellow jerseys, although its best opportunity to retake the lead in the first half hour came in the 27th minute, when Suarez missed a golden chance to head home a goal off a free kick by Messi.

But 12 minutes later, Barca brought the full force of its striking firepower, with Suarez beating two defenders and somehow keeping the ball alive near the endline before dishing off to Messi.

The Argentine's shot at close range was saved by Varas, but Neymar was there to power home the loose ball with his left foot.

Early in the second half, Varas kept Las Palmas within striking distance when he saved a shot at close range by Suarez, who had been set up by an Alves header.

The loss of Viera, who exited the game in the 66th minute with physical problems, seemed like it might completely eliminate Las Palmas' ability to create scoring chances.

But the home squad got a big lift in the 76th minute when Quique Setien sent on Argentine striker Sergio Araujo, who fired two shots that just missed hitting the woodwork in the final minutes.

""These are the games that win you La Liga,"" Suarez said afterward, referring to the Catalans' inability to put away their opponent until the final whistle.

""To win titles, you have to suffer, and we've been suffering in several games away from home but we go away happy with the three points,"" the Uruguayan added.

With the win, first-place Barcelona, the defending champion, now has a commanding nine-point lead over Atletico Madrid and a 10-point lead over Real Madrid, but those clubs can make up ground with victories on Sunday. EFE

This historic announcement provides the opportunity not only to help define President Obamas legacy, but to also prove that two countries once divided by generations of strife can come together through diplomacy to support the American and Cuban people.

There is ample room for American businesses across all sectors to gain a foothold in the Cuban market, especially in agriculture. Cuba imports 80 percent of its food from far away countries such as Brazil and Argentina. - James Williams

President Obamas visit comes at a pivotal moment for our country. At a time of heightened political divisiveness in and out of Washington on nearly every issue, support for a new Cuba policy cuts through tired party politics. Seventy-two percent of Americans from both parties agree that its time for Congress to end the embargo and open the U.S. up for business and travel with our Cuban neighbors. The Cuban people overwhelmingly support this as well, as 97 percent of them favor ending the embargo.

This agreement among Americans on both sides of the aisle, and in rural areas and cities alike, is why we launched Engage Cuba, a bipartisan coalition dedicated to ending the Cuban travel and trade embargo. We work with local community leaders and business people from across the country who can envision a future with renewed U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations and can see the increased economic activity that comes with it. It is amazing to see bipartisan leaders across diverse sectors in states such as Tennessee and Ohio come together through Engage Cuba State Councils to stand united in their support for ending the Cuban embargo, and because of the possibilities ahead, that support will only continue to grow.

Renewed U.S.-Cuba relations is appealing to Americans because at the center of this burgeoning relationship is the core American principle of opportunity. Engagement with Cuba presents numerous prospects for U.S. businesses and the Cuban people. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, trade with Cuba could generate $4.3 billion in American exports.

There is ample room for American businesses across all sectors to gain a foothold in the Cuban market, especially in agriculture. Cuba imports 80 percent of its food from far away countries such as Brazil and Argentina. But if the embargo were to be lifted, Cubans could instead import fresh and nutritious food from its close neighbor, the United States, and American farmers could bring their products to a largely untapped market while delivering quality, affordable food to the Cuban people.

This is just one of the many economic opportunities President Obama will witness when he visits Cuba. With the need for infrastructure investment, telecommunications expansion and so much more, each day the U.S. cannot trade with Cuba is a missed opportunity. The current embargo halts job growth and economic development in places that need it most  both in Cuba and here in America. But these changes are not solely the responsibility of the U.S. In order to build on this diplomatic moment, Cuba has to do its part to continue to open its economy and support greater economic ties with the United States.

As the President embarks on his first visit to Cuba, and opens up additional possibilities to engage with Cuba in the future, he is continuing the significant progress made over the last year. Just recently, the U.S. and Cuba reached an agreement to commence commercial flights for the first time in 50 years. In a short time, millions of Americans will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and soak in its rich and vibrant culture. And just this week, U.S. and Cuban trade officials met to discuss additional regulatory changes that can be made to support trade and commerce.

So we should celebrate President Obamas trip to Cuba as a historic moment, one that seeks to put an end to the conflict and tension that defined the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba for decades. After years of a failed policy, it is time for our country to engage with Cuba and ensure our foreign policy encourages opportunity that is good for both Americans and Cubans.

James Williams is the President of Engage Cuba, the leading coalition of private companies and organizations working to end the travel and trade embargo on Cuba.

This might seem outlandish, but cultural geographer Mark Bonta tells Newsweek it's ""standard knowledge"" among the aboriginal community and firefighters in northern Australia.

According to the Washington Post, birds of prey are known to hunt around the edges of wildfireswhich force small animals to flee their hiding placesbut those fires don't always start where the food is.

That's why brown falcons and black kites are apparently picking up burning sticks and dropping them elsewhere to start new fires. Bob Gosford, a lawyer who works with Australia's aboriginal people, has collected 15 accounts of birds starting fires, a behavior that is referenced in at least one old aboriginal ceremony.

He and Bonta of Penn State are working on getting their findings published in a peer-reviewed journal. If the pair can prove that birds are starting fires, it ""would force us to rewrite what we know,"" Bonta tells Newsweek.

It's been taken for granted that either humans or lightning cause wildfires. The change would mean birds, not humans, may have been responsible for the fires that cleared the savannas.

It would also open the possibility that humans learned to control fire by watching birds. ""The birds arent starting fires from scratch, but its the next best thing,"" Bonta tells the Post.

""Fire is supposedly so uniquely human."" Bonta admits their findings won't be accepted by the scientific community until they have video of the birds' behavior. That's why they're asking people around the world to keep an eye out for fire-starting birds and to have their cameras handy.

""If I deviated one degree, I would hear this great booming voice from heaven, and it wouldn't be God,"" Flynt said in an earlier interview.

Details of the service were fiercely guarded. The author, who for decades had declined media interviews, had wanted a quick and quiet funeral without pomp or fanfare, family members said.

""We obeyed her wishes,"" said Jackie Stovall, Lee's second cousin.

The town was appropriately somber a day after their native daughter's death. Black bows adorned the doors of the old courthouse in Monroeville where Lee as a child, like her literary creation Scout Finch, would peer down from the balcony as her lawyer father tried his cases in the courtroom.

Mockingbirds chirped and frolicked among blooming camellia bushes outside the courthouse on a warm Alabama morning that teased the early arrival of spring.

Jared Anton, of Hollywood, Florida, sat outside the old courthouse during part of a planned vacation through the South that coincided with Lee's death.

Anton said reading the book  in which attorney Atticus Finch defends a wrongly accused African-American man  was one of the reasons he decided to become a lawyer.

""It had an impact on me when I was younger. I wanted to do the right thing, to stand up to people, to defend the innocent, if you will,"" Anton said. ""It is the greatest American novel. Name one that really has had more of an impact on Americans than that book.""

The Southern town was home to childhood friends Truman Capote and Lee, giving rise to its self-given nickname of the literary capital of the South. Ann Mote, owner of the Ol' Curiosities & Book Shoppe in Monroeville, said she thinks the town will always be linked to Lee.

""She's a part of it and always will be,"" Mote said.

Tributes to Lee's novel dot the town. The courthouse is a museum that pays homage to her creation. There's the Mockingbird Inn on the edge of town and a statute of children reading ""Mockingbird"" in the courthouse square. Tickets go on sale in a week for the city's annual ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" play, Mote said. A black mourning bow donned the top of the sign at the bookstore, where a stack of hardcopy ""Mockingbird"" books sat the counter along with a DVD of the movie.

The town this summer had a celebration for the release of ""Go Set a Watchman""  Lee's initial draft of the story that would become ""Mockingbird""  even though many residents had ambivalent feelings about its release.

""She was an Alabama treasure. She was an international treasure. We were all blessed by her life and her work as we are diminished by her passing,"" said Cathy Randall, a friend of Lee's for the past 30 years.

Flynt and Randall said they had recently visited Lee at the Monroeville assisted living facility where she had lived for several years because of declining health. Flynt said Lee was ""savagely witty.""

""She was still the most brilliant person in any room,"" Randall said.","[]"

Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app

Its weird. The Pope is thought to be a third rail of politics. Fighting with the Pope is a loser. At least it has been.

Not any more.

The Pope criticized Donald Trump, without actually using his name. But the Popes remarks were clear. Someone who builds a wall and not bridges is not Christian. The statement came while the Pope was in Mexico right at the U.S. border in response to a question about Donald Trumps plan to build a wall.

Theres been some quibbling about the meaning of the full quote, the entire paragraph of words Pope Francis spoke, in which he confessed a less than full understanding of what Donald Trump has said or proposed.

But the headline was the headline: Wall Builder Donald Trump Isnt A Christian.

Trump responded that it was disgraceful for the Pope to question his Christianity.

Republican candidates running against Donald Trump ducked. Sorry, gotta run, forgot to feed the cat.

The Vatican hastened to clarify the Popes remarks, saying it was not a personal attack, and the Pope doesnt involve himself in politics.

Later, Trump softened his tone, saying he doesnt like fighting with the Pope.

With both retreating to their respective corners, its fair to wonder who won that round?

Weirdly, it seems to be Trump. Social media exploded with pictures of the massive walls surrounding the Vatican, and noted Trump bashers like George Will took the opportunity to note the Pope frequently jumps into political matters on the liberal side, and he should butt out. In all, it seems the fisticuffs with the Pope didnt hurt Donald Trump and might have helped him, at least in the short run.

Nobody wins wars with the Pope, at least not for the last few centuries.

A federal magistrate in California has ordered Apple to rewrite iPhone software to allow a government backdoor into your phone.

We live in a day and age when hackers have infiltrated the American governments computers routinely and stolen confidential information. Hackers prey on Android devices, Blackberries, etc. They steal information, add malware, and spy. Resourceful hackers can take over phones audio and cameras to spy with greater detail.

Apple has taken an approach with its iPhones to make them as secure for consumers as possible. Software is sandboxed, meaning various software on your phone cannot interact with each other. Fingerprint reader codes are stored on the phone and are not able to connect to the internet or other systems. Apples phones are very secure. They keep hackers out. They run reliably.

But because the phones keep hackers out, they make it harder for the government to break in during an emergency.

In the case at hand, one of the San Bernardino terrorists used an iPhone and the government wants access. Apple has given the government what it can give, but has not given direct access to the phone because it is not in Apples powers to give it. They designed the phone that way. They did not design a phone for terrorists, they designed a phone for consumers in an unsafe world where even super secure government servers can get hacked.

The federal magistrate wants Apple to redesign its software to make it less secure, less safe, and more easily hackable. Today, in an open letter, Apple is declining to do so. I agree with Apple.

There are lots of terrible people out there from terrorists to child pornographers who might want an iPhone because they think the government will not be able to get access. But there are vastly more people out there who want to hack into my phone.

The government cannot keep its own servers secure. If the government gets a backdoor to my phone, it will not be able to keep the backdoor to itself.

I support Apples relentless pursuit of consumer privacy. Bad people are always going to do bad things. But good people should not see their privacy reduced as a result.

The U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster uploaded some clips of an interview with Emma Coronel Aispuro that the network will broadcast in full on Sunday.

""I fear for his life,"" said the wife of the Sinaloa drug cartel chief, who escaped from the Altiplano I maximum-security prison outside Mexico City in July 2015 but was recaptured in January and returned to the same penitentiary.

Coronel, who married Guzman in 2007, complained about her husband's prison conditions, maintained that his health was suffering and said she would hold the Mexican government responsible for whatever happens to him.

""We don't know if he's eating well. In general, we don't know his situation because we haven't been able to see him,"" she said.

Guzman's wife said it was clear that the drug lord was being made to pay for having escaped last year. ""They say they're not punishing him, but of course they are.""

""El Chapo"" is being constantly monitored day and night, she said. ""They're there all day long. They're doing roll call at all hours. They don't let him sleep. He doesn't have any privacy, even to go to the bathroom.""

""I think any human being has the right to have at least the basic things of a human being. It's clear they're not enforcing that in his case,"" Coronel said.

None of the video clips provide insight into Guzman's personality, the couple's private life, their wedding or the drug lord's relationship with the couple's twin daughters, aged three and a half.

Journalist Anabel Hernandez conducted the interview, which was produced in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program.

Guzman escaped from Altiplano I on July 11, 2015, using a nearly mile-long tunnel that authorities say was built at great expense, but Mexican security forces tracked him down on Jan. 8 in his native state of Sinaloa.

He had earlier busted out of a Mexican prison in 2001 and evaded authorities for more than 13 years before being recaptured on Feb. 22, 2014, in the Pacific resort city of Mazatlan.

""There it was, artifacts from the 16th century lying on the ground,"" said Tom Garner, a history buff whose discovery has made him a celebrity in archaeological circles.

According to experts, Garners find at a newly cleared lot along the Pensacola Bay was the landing site of a doomed 1559 expedition led by Tristan de Luna. The discovery bolsters Pensacolas claim as the first European settlement in the modern-day United States, six years before Pedro Menendez founded St. Augustine on Floridas Atlantic coast. The Luna expedition was scuttled by a hurricane that sank five ships in September 1559, shortly after the fleet arrived.

Part of Lunas doomed fleet was discovered in Pensacola Bay in the 1990s. But the exact site where Luna and 1,500 soldiers, Mexican Indians and Spanish settlers lived for about two years had eluded searchers  until now. Many believed Lunas settlement had been washed away in storms or was entombed beneath centuries of land development.

Archaeologists from the University of West Florida are now digging in the quaint, waterfront neighborhood of homes and businesses.

John Worth, an associate professor of anthropology, specializes in Spanish colonial history and has studied Luna expeditionary documents. The university confirmed the find this fall and announced it to the archaeology world just before the beginning of the year.

""This gives us a whole new window on early Spanish colonialism here in the United States,"" he said.

Luna was ordered by Spain's King Philip II to construct a village that would include a church, government house, town plaza and a residential site. Archaeologists hope to find out how far the work progressed.

Worth said if Luna's colonization attempt had succeeded, it would have changed the history of North America. A lasting Spanish foothold in the Panhandle could have checked later French influence on the region, he said.

Cal Halbirt, city archaeologist for St. Augustine, said the discovery should add new understanding to Florida's colonial past.

""Having actual, tangible remains from the Tristan de Luna site is very important,"" he said. ""I think, from a level of wow factor, it ranks right up there.""

Meanwhile, St. Augustine proudly maintains its claim as the oldest continuously occupied European settlement city in the present-day U.S. ""There is definitely community pride because of that,"" he said.

Cohen thought that odd, because the eight-legged arachnid looked tiny to her, reports Live Science.

And so a study was born. They set out to see if people's fear of spiders can influence perception of the creature's size, and that appears to be the case.

""Although individuals with both high and low arachnophobia rated spiders as highly unpleasant, only the highly fearful participants overestimated the spider size,"" says Leibovich in a statement.

How the researchers tested this: Figuring women were more averse to spiders than men, they divided 25 women into a low-fear group and a high-fear group.

From there, they had the subjects review pictures of butterflies, birds, and spiders and estimate their sizes, using a sliding scale with a fly on one end and a lamb on the other.

Although both groups found the spiders unpleasant, only the fearful group overestimated their size compared to butterflies, the researchers report in Biological Psychology. To check if this perceptual phenomenon happens with other creepy-crawlies, the researchers duplicated the experiment using wasps, beetles, and butterfliesand found that the group more fearful of wasps didn't overestimate their size compared to the butterflies.

They did overestimate the size of the beetles, but based on exit interviews, the researchers think it's because most subjects IDed the beetles as more phobia-inducing cockroaches.

The results raise a question, says Leibovich: ""Is it fear that triggers size disturbance, or maybe the size disturbance is what causes fear in the first place?"" (How to cure a spider phobia in two minutes.)

Continue Reading Below

The victories by Trump and Clinton solidified their positions as the front-runners to win their parties' respective presidential nominations ahead of the Nov. 8 election.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush suffered a distant fourth place finish and announced he had suspended his campaign, ending his dream of becoming a third Bush president after his father and brother.

""The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision,"" an emotional Bush said in Columbia. He finished far out of the running in each of the first three states.

Trump won despite getting into a controversy with Pope Francis and having a debate performance that raised questions about his temperament in the days before the voting.

Trump, 69, easily defeated Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who were in a close fight for second place and the right to declare themselves the main anti-Trumpalternative.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

With 57 percent of South Carolina precincts reporting, Trump had 33.9 percent, followed by Cruz with 21.8 percent and Rubio with 21.5 percent.

""People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE),"" Trump tweeted shortly before the television networks declared him the winner.

It was Trump's second victory in a row, after New Hampshire on Feb. 9, an outcome that frightens establishment Republicans but thrills the ""throw-the-bums-out"" conservative base of the party that has long been fed up with Washington.

After South Carolina, the Republican presidential campaign is about to rapidly pick up steam in March when dozens of states hold nominating contests. Another candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich, is concentrating on midwestern and northern states in the state-by-state contest to pick nominees for the Nov. 8 election.

Clinton's victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses could help calm Democratic Party worries about the strength of her campaign.

Her win denied Sanders the breakthrough win he sought in a state with a heavy minority population, but his ability to close a one-time double-digit polling lead for Clinton suggested the Democratic nominating race could be long and hard fought.

With 85 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton was leading with 52.5 percent of the vote to Sanders' 47.4 percent. Vote counting was delayed in Nevada by heavy turnout.

Clinton's victory buoyed worried supporters and gave her fresh momentum as she heads into the next contest in South Carolina on Feb. 27, where polls show her with a double-digit lead largely as a result of heavy support from black voters.

""Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,"" she told cheering supporters at a victory rally in Las Vegas. ""This is your campaign.""

Sanders vowed to fight on and set his sights on the 11 states that vote on ""Super Tuesday,"" March 1. He predicted that when Democrats gather for their nominating convention in Philadelphia in July, ""We are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.""

""The wind is at our banks,"" he said. ""We have the momentum.""

After routing Clinton in New Hampshire and finishing a strong second in Iowa, states with nearly all-white populations, Sanders had hoped to prove in Nevada that he could win over black and Hispanic voters and compete nationally as the race moves to states with more diverse populations.

But entrance polling in Nevada showed he badly lost among black voters, by 76 percent to 22 percent, a bad omen for South Carolina and other southern states with big black populations. He did win among Hispanics by 53 percent to 45 percent.

Clinton's campaign has argued she would assert control of the Democratic race once it moved to more diverse states with black and Hispanic populations who have traditionally backed Clinton and have been slow to warm to Sanders.

Trump, the bellicose New York billionaire, created some last-minute drama in South Carolina after Pope Francis said on Thursday his views on U.S. immigration were ""not Christian.""Trump initially called Francis ""disgraceful,"" but later called him ""a wonderful guy.""

The Vatican later clarified the pope's remarks, saying they were ""in no way"" a personal attack and were not an indication how to vote.

Trump stirred fresh controversy on Friday when he told a crowd about a U.S. general who was said to have dipped bullets in pigs' blood to kill Muslim prisoners a century ago.

The evidence comes from a series of scrapes that were uncovered in 100 million year old Dakota sandstone at four sites in western Colorado. These ancient scrapes from Cretaceous therapods are similar to a behavior known as nest scrape display or scrape ceremonies among modern birds, where males show off their ability to be good mates by digging up pseudo nests for their prospective partners.

Related: Ancient marine reptiles flew through the water

These are the first sites with evidence of dinosaur mating display rituals ever discovered, and the first physical evidence of courtship behavior, Lockley, a University of Colorado Denver geology professor and a co-author on a study of the findings in Scientific Reports Thursday, said in a statement. These huge scrape displays fill in a missing gap in our understanding of dinosaur behavior.

Related Image Expand / Contract Team leader Martin Lockley (right) and co-author (Ken Cart) kneel beside two large Cretaceous-age scrapes from western Colorado that are the first physical-reported evidence that large theropod dinosaurs engaged in courtship behavior. (M. Lockley )

Lockley, who also is a world-renowned expert on dinosaur footprints, found evidence of more than 50 dinosaur scrapes, some as large as bathtubs, in an area where tracks of carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs have also been confirmed. The display arenas, also called leks were found in two National Conservation Areas (Dominguez-Escalante and Gunnison Gorge) on property permitted by the Bureau of Land Management near

Evidence of mating areas were also discovered by Lockley at Dinosaur Ridge, a National Natural Landmark, just west of Denver.

Related: These dinosaurs liked to get their feet wet

Since it was logistically difficult to remove the scrapes, the researchers turned to technology for help. They created 3-D images of the scrapes using a technique of layering photographs called photogrammetry. They also made rubber molds and fiberglass copies of the scrapes  which are being stored at the Denver Museum.

Until now, theories abounded about dinosaur sex including that it was driven by sexual selection and the idea that male dinosaurs in prehistoric times looked for mates and drove off weaker rivals. Females, meanwhile, would have selected the biggest and strongest mates  much as we see in the animal kingdom today.

The problem was there was no physical evidence  until now.

The scrapes, which the researchers believe were most likely associated with territorial activity during the breeding season, demonstrate that the mating behavior is similar to birds - which makes sense since they are descended from dinosaurs.

The scrape evidence has significant implications, Lockley said. This is physical evidence of pre-historic foreplay that is very similar to birds today. Modern birds using scrape ceremony courtship usually do so near their final nesting sites. So the fossil scrape evidence offers a tantalizing clue that dinosaurs in heat may have gathered here millions of years ago to breed and then nest nearby.

Related: 'The Good Dinosaur': Could humans and dinos coexist?

Initially, the authors considered several possible reasons for the scrapes  including a nesting site, territorial markings or evidence that the dinosaurs were digging for food.

They ruled out the nesting site because they found no eggs while the food theory suffers from the fact that such behavior probably would have resulted in deeper digging and pooling that would wash out scrape marks in sandy sediments.

As for the scrapes done to mark territory, the researchers said it was unlikely since this behavior is found in mammals but not known in water-conserving uricothelic reptiles and birds.

That leaves the mating behavior, which the authors said was consistently supported by the evidence and is similar to the rituals of several modern bird species including ostriches, puffins and shorebirds like Wilsons plover.

Thomas E. Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science who did not take part in the study, told FoxNews.com that the findings were interesting especially because so little is known about the mating rituals of dinosaurs.

Related: Study sheds fresh light on early relatives of dinosaurs

Williamson said that it is suspected that dinosaurs must have had a rich repertoire of behaviors related to mating and/or territoriality based on the elaborate skull ornamentation, colored plumage, and other structures that many dinosaurs have. Some were using these structures to visually recognize and communicate with others of their own species, he said, while others dinosaurs such as lambeosaurine hadrosaurs (crested duck-billed dinosaurs), probably communicated through acoustic displays using resonating tubes on their heads.

Williamson agreed that dinosaur behavior must have been similar to birds and their other closest living relatives, crocodilians. Both groups use complex behaviors for territorial and courtship displays and based on this, it is likely that dinosaurs did too.

However, this new evidence is really something special. Tracks, such as the unusual ones described in this paper, provide actual physical evidence of dinosaur activity  and similar activity appears to be present in some modern birds, he said in an email interview. This suggests that some of these behaviors can be traced far back into the dinosaurian heritage of birds. This really brings some of these animals to life!","[]"

The television report said Sunday's blasts struck in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa  a frequent target for similar explosions.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists around Syria, said the blasts killed 25 and wounded more than 100. The Observatory said the blasts were caused by two vehicles rigged with explosives after reporting earlier that it was not immediately clear if the second was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attacker wearing an explosive belt.

State TV said the blasts occurred at about 8:15 a.m. saying they were the result of two car bombs.

The report aired footage of the destruction caused by the blasts. Debris and mangled cars filled the streets and the charred body of a man was seen being taken away on a stretcher.

The Zahra neighborhood is predominantly Alawite, the minority sect to which President Bashar Assad belongs.

Homs, once dubbed the capital of the Syrian revolution, has been hit with a wave of explosions in recent months, killing and wounding scores of people.

Two blasts hit the Zahra neighborhood on Jan. 26, killing 20 and wounding more than 100 people.

Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!

O'REILLY: Back to Fox segment tonight. How to solve the border mess.

Joining us from Washington, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.

So Senator, top of the program we told the audience about polls that are coming in now on the border crisis. President Obama getting hammered. The vast majority of Americans think he is doing a terrible job there. However, just 23 percent of Americans believe the Republicans in Congress, of which you are one are doing a good job. 23 percent. So you guys are getting a blast as well. So my question to you is, if you were the president of the United States how would you stop this humanitarian disaster down there?

SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R) FLORIDA: Well, first of all, it wouldn't have happened because I never would have signed an executive order granting a deferred action to those who were in this country illegally. I think he was showing a tremendous amount of compassion, but that was not the right way to do it. It sent a message that actually invited people to come, and you see the disaster that has followed. The second thing, I would say, is that the first step in this process needs to be an all-out effort to finally put to rest the illegal immigration problem in America. And this involves the construction of strategic fencing, but also the deployment of specific technologies like ground sensors and cameras and drones and so forth to secure the southern border with Mexico. It involves a verify system, to require employers to verify that the people they are hiring are legally here. It involves an entry-exit tracking system, particularly at our airports, because 40 percent of our illegal immigration problem are people that enter the country legally and overstay visas. That would be the first step in this process, you have to do every single aspect of it, and only after you do that can you move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration .

O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100 percent, you have got to stop - you've got to stop the madness first. But let's deal with the kids now because this is the humanitarian crisis the whole world is watching. Number one, you have no fence in these hot sectors, you say we should. And I agree. Number two, Governor Perry of Texas is asking and has asked for years, the National Guard to get down and help the border patrol. Do you favor that?

RUBIO: I do, and again, that has to do with manpower and that would be a part of any effort to secure the border.

O'REILLY: OK. So you put the guard down there, you show the world the pictures of our military on the border. Right away just those pictures then would de-incentivize the people who are paying these terrible cartels to human smuggle. So you would have a solution. All right, now, why do you think the folks are holding it against the Republicans -- are they believing President Obama when he is trying to blame you, guys, for the border madness?

RUBIO: I think it is an indictment of all of Washington, of the failure for more than a decade to deal with the problem that we know exists. Unless you are in favor of the status quo, unless you look at what is happening now and say, I think, this is working for America you have to be in favor of fixing it. So that is not really the debate, the debate is how do you fix it? And in my mind, the first step in fixing this, is to stop the growth and the problem that we have right now with illegal immigration, and then to begin to erode that number, to lower it, so that you can move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration process towards one that is based on merit and works for our country in the 21ST century.

O'REILLY: OK, would you send the kids back?

RUBIO: Yes, and I'll tell you why that' important. Because the leading reason why this is happening, is word of mouth is spreading that if you make it to the United States as an unaccompanied minor or as a family with children you are going to be treated differently than adults who are traveling by themselves. And that word gets back, so imagine for a moment, if someone comes across the border, as a family or as an individual, they are now released into the population, with a notice to appear, but, of course, they never will, or do. And then what happens is, they call back home, people see they made the voyage safely, and you've now created a word of mouth incentive.

O'REILLY: Sure.

RUBIO: For others to do the same thing.

O'REILLY: All right, so you would send them back - you would get the increased courts, the judges down there to get them out, because that's going to be a big thing when that starts to happen. How many times have you spoken to President Obama personally about immigration reform?

RUBIO: Well, we've spoken a couple of times, but not in more than a year. And again, my conversations always begin with, what I've been saying publicly, and that is, anyone who is in favor of immigration reform must first be in favor of border security.

O'REILLY: And then how - what does he reply to that?

RUBIO: Well, I think they don't necessarily - well, two points - number one, the thing they'll say is the border has never been more secure, which is true for a handful of the sectors, but not for the others, not for the Rio Grande sector, not for the other sectors that we've seen, the Tucson sector of the border where people are crossing. And that has been the real challenge, is that the argument if you recall, he gave a speech in El Paso a few years ago where he mocked people who said we needed more border security by talking about how we would insist on a moat with alligators in it. And of course, now, we've seen that the border is in fact not secure.

O'REILLY: All right, Senator, we appreciate your time tonight, thank you.

Whether you are a skeptic or not, many cruise liners provide passengers with the five-star luxury one might expect from a boutique hotel. Plus you get the added benefit of seeing several locations from the comfort of your stateroom.

Here are some of the worlds most lavish and extravagant liners afloat:

1.&nbspSilverseas Silver Shadow Silversea This small fleet of just eight ships, led by the beautiful Silver Shadow, provides travelers with a personal and indulgent voyage experience that includes Egyptian cotton sheets, Bulgari bath amenities, uniquely stocked minibars, private verandas, and personal butler service. The boats in the fleet are smaller than most, so they are able to access smaller ports all over the globe. The line is known for its spectacular annual round-the-world voyage, which sets sail in January of every year and stops in 50 ports in 30 countries over 115 days while circumnavigating the globe. And it will just set you back for the small fee of $58,950.

2.&nbspRMS Queen Mary 2 Cunard Line The Queen Mary 2 wins the prize for the most expensive cruise liner cabin in the world, costing a staggering $183,000 for the round-the-world trip. That is more than $1,600 a night. However, with 2,249 square feet of space over two floors, his and hers bathrooms, a private gym, and a large private deck, some say the price is worth it. The 2015 round-the-world trip will take in 38 ports in 22 countries.

3.&nbspRoyal Caribbeans Oasis of the Seas Royal Caribbean In 2009, Royal Caribbean International announced that it was launching the worlds most expensive cruise ship, costing an eye-popping $1.4 billion to build. The Oasis of the Seas measures 1,184 feet in length, stands 18 decks tall, and has a crew of 2,394 to tend to 5,400 passengers. But it is the ships amenities that make it spectacular. The boat comes equipped with a football-field-size park with more than 12,000 trees and plants, an AquaTheatre with seating for 600 people, two rock-climbing walls, two FlowRider Surf Simulators, a zipline, a 600-meter running track, a large main theater, and a full-service spa, just to name a few.

4.&nbspSeaDream Yacht Clubs SeaDream I and II SeaDream Yacht Club SeaDream has two luxury mega yachts (as they like to call them), which can hold up to 56 couples and 95 crew each, providing luxury, privacy, and pampering to its guests in a setting that is more intimate than big-ship sailing provides. The five-star service sees passengers waited on hand and foot; treated to award-winning gourmet cuisine and fine wines; and given access to a fitness center and a variety of water sports activities, including kayaks, paddle boards, snorkeling equipment, and Jet Skis.

5.&nbspCrystal Cruises the Crystal Serenity Crystal Cruises Regularly voted the worlds best cruise ship, the Crystal Serenity underwent a full refurbishment in 2013 costing $17 million. The ships interior design is inspired by the casual-yet-cultured vibe of Southern California and has unique features including a chefs herb garden, vertical walls of greenery, and a retractable glass roof in the Trident Grill. The Crystal Penthouse suite has 1,345 square feet of space, London-inspired interior design, 24-hour butler service, and a guest bathroom. The rest of the suites feature fresh flowers, Frette linens and robes, room service, and nightly turndown service.","[]"

Weve collected a list of parks across the globe that are home to some of the strangest, most off-the-wall sculptures you can imagine. From Man Throwing Babies to 1001 Nights built from thousands of tons of sand, these works of art will likely leave you scratching your head in wonder.

1.&nbspAll Hands on Deck Suncruise Resort At Sun Cruise Resort in South Korea, you can enjoy the feel of a cruise while staying safely on land. At the hotel, shaped like a full-size cruise ship perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean, you can find a variety of eccentricities-- not the least of which is the sculpture garden. Its centerpiece is a gigantic pair of hands called The Hands of Blessing, which open to the sea and are a perfect spot to catch the sun rise. Also found in their sculpture garden is a collection of totem poles nestled among flowers and gardens. The resort is reportedly a popular place to propose.

2.&nbspUnder the Sea www.jasondecairestaylor.com In Mexico, dive into the waters around Cancun, Isla Mujeres and Punta Nizuc to discover an underwater museum of 450 permanent life-size sculptures by Jason deCaires Taylor. Named the Museo Subacuatico de Arte (MUSA), the underwater park provides a reef structure that encourages coral life, while also offering an attraction for snorkelers and divers, drawing them away from other natural reefs that are in recovery. Mexico is not the only home to one of Taylors under-the-sea sculpture parks. You can also find them below the sea in Grenada, in a river in Canterbury, England, and the Bahamas.

3.&nbspA Desert Marvel The Sand Sculpture Company What can you do with 35,000 tons of sand, 70 sculptors and five soccer fields of space? Create the worlds largest sand sculpture, of course. Opened from January to April 2014, the sands of time recently erased this marvel in Kuwait (all sand sculptures are temporary). Yet, the park was a spectacle to behold. Created by the Sand Sculpture Company and commissioned by the Proud to Be Kuwaiti organization, this sculpture pictured took nine weeks to build and featured a 10,000-ton central palace that was more than five stories high and which ranks as the tallest sand sculpture ever built. Look for more sand sculptures around the world this year at the Fulong Sand Sculpting Art Festival in Taiwan through June, the Fiesa International Sand Sculpture Festival in Portugal May through October, and Storyland at Frankston Waterfront in Australia in December.

4.&nbspArt in the Park Visit Oslo Norway offers visitors the worlds largest sculpture park made by a single artist, and is one of the countrys most popular attractions. Vigeland Park in Oslo features more than 200 bronze and granite sculptures by artist Gustav Vigeland whose works evoke twisting, intertwining people in various poses. Although within a lovely park setting thats a favorite with locals, the sculptures are off the wall with names like Man Throwing Babies and a somewhat erotic mixing of bodies. Oslo is also home to a brand new sculpture park within Ekeberg public park, where Edvard Munch famously got his inspiration for his painting The Scream. The park is a mix of artists from classical masters, such as Rodin and Renoir, to more modern and contemporary artists-- all of whose works honor women.

5.&nbspAbout Face Reuters Where can you see the worlds most famous (and infamous) people recreated in stone? At Great Stone Face Sculpture Park in South Korea. About an hour or so by bus from Seoul, this park is full of sculptures (mostly just large faces) of everyone from Sharon Stone, Elvis, Fidel Castro and Abraham Lincoln to Jesus and Arnold Palmer. The founder has created a space that he says honors some of the most important political leaders, writers, scientists, philosophers, artists and more from 180 countries around the world. The park is divided into themed walks like Buddhism, Greek Gods, Musicians, Sports Stars and others. You can even catch a demonstration of how the faces are created.

6.&nbspHeavy Metal Audrey Porter If you happen to be driving through South Dakota, you might notice some large sculptures out in the middle of the prairie.

At the time the NSAs surveillance program was under attack in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. As I walked into the gala that night several reporters stopped me to ask for my thoughts on the NSA. My answer apparently surprised them because it ended up making headlines the next morning: Ex-Homeland Secretary says I dont want the NSA looking at my emails.

I didnt then, and I still dont. I objected to reports that an NSA surveillance program had given agency operatives the green light to look at the emails of American citizens without probable cause. It was an overreach of a program that began in the months after 9/11 when I served as advisor to the president on Homeland Security.

I share this anecdote today because it not only underscores my record of protecting privacy, it will help you to better understand why I hope Apple CEO Tim Cook will reconsider his opposition to the court order to unlock an iPhone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

Mr. Cooks open letter to Apple customers, in which he explains the companys rationale, is both thoughtful and sincere. He raises valid concerns about the dangerous precedent that would be established should Apple work with the FBI to unlock this particular phone. I would agree such a danger would exist if the federal government were asking for broad powers to unlock phones without hard evidence or approved warrants. However, that is not the case in this situation.

It is one thing for Apple to oppose, on privacy grounds, providing back doors to the FBI regarding consumer phones generally. But in this case, we know the heinous acts committed by the San Bernardino terrorists. Fourteen people were murdered. When we know that a particular individual has committed a crime  as we know here  it is a wholly different matter. It is logical to assume that there are phone numbers and other information on that iPhone that could very well lead to co-conspirators and perhaps prevent other attacks.

Earlier this month, Twitter announced it had suspended 125,000 ISIS-related accounts. Facebook has also started to take steps to help combat terrorism.

I applaud such efforts and was pleased to see that leaders of our tech giants recently agreed to sit down with administration officials to take a more proactive approach to dealing with the growing scourge of terrorism and their use of technology. This situation underscores the need for the broader tech community and government to come together to prevent known terrorists from hiding behind technology.

While I strongly believed the NSA was overreaching in its review of emails, I see no such overreach by the FBI in their investigation in California. Nor do I see a threat to Apple customers broadly  like me  who will continue to benefit from the strong privacy shields Apples programmers have developed.

I believe Mr. Cook when he says he has no sympathy for terrorists and that he thinks Apple customers will agree with his position. Yet in opposing this court order, and in the wake of events in places like Paris and San Bernardino, can terrorists now conclude they have an ally in Apple? I believe Apple customers in this instance are able to separate the need to protect their privacy with the needs of law enforcement to defend all of us from future terror attacks.

Jason Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper. Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations, police said.

A Michigan prosecutor said authorities were investigating a Facebook post that indicated Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he was aware of the post, but was not prepared to discuss it.

Dalton lived just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.

Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said investigators contacted Dalton's wife Saturday evening ""to make sure she wasn't a victim."" Hadley added that she's cooperated with police in their investigation.

Law enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt.

Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

He described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where the woman was shot and seriously wounded.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said.

Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree incomprehensible, according to Fox 17 Online.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.

Mayor Maria Melendez Altieri of Ponce, the southern Puerto Rican municipality where the author was born, regretted the passing of Ramirez de Arellano, whom she described as ""a great human being who won great recognition for our country through her letters and literature that evinced such a deep love for her city and her country.""

While Ferre Ramirez de Arellano studied at the University of Puerto Rico, she founded in 1972, together with several of her companions, the student literary magazine ""Zona de Carga y Descarga,"" which offered a space for publishing new authors who as yet had no access to the island's established literary publications.

In 1981 she published her first book of children's stories, ""El Medio Pollito,"" followed by ""Los Cuentos de Juan Bobo"" and ""La Mona que le Pisaron la Cola.""

In 1987 she launched the novel ""Maldito Amor,"" and in 1993 she published ""La Batalla de las Virgenes,"" based on the practice of Catholicism in Puerto Rico.

And if he doesnt give ground, Obama may have only one option for an end-run: a recess appointment.

But Republicans can rest easy: GOP leaders have an ace up their sleeve.

The truth is, it doesnt take much to prevent a recess appointment, as long as congressional leaders are watching the calendar. Closely.

If youre trying to block the president from making one to the Supreme Court, all the Senate has to do is commence a session every three days. Because the Senate is only truly in recess after that three-day period.

The Constitution actually requires the House and Senate to meet every three days unless theres an agreement between the two bodies to skip, and go on recess. With the battle over a Supreme Court pick heating up, dont expect that to happen in the near future.

All McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have to do is schedule what are called pro-forma sessions at three-day intervals for the rest of the year. Pro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting but a minute or two  and sometimes, a matter of seconds. They help the House and Senate comport with the constitutional mandate of huddling every three days  even if they arent really doing anything.

The House and Senate dont conduct any business during these confabs. In congressional parlance, theyre sometimes referred to as just gavel-in, gavel-out. No votes. No speeches. Few words are uttered at all.

The phrase pro-forma is derived from Latin, meaning formality.

Congress doesnt consider itself adjourned or on recess if its meeting every three days. And thats all it takes to block a recess appointment for the rest of the presidents term.

In 2011 and 2012, Democrats still controlled the Senate. But Republicans ran the show in the House. The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, the House and Senate met every three days.

In early 2012, the president made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments. The court said that was the point of the three-day sessions. The Senate was indeed in session. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against the administrations brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three days.

Ironically, Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case. They argued that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the Presidents arsenal. They added it was unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronism.

When the roles were reversed, Democrats used the same tool.

For much of the final two years of President George W. Bushs term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointment.

In 2003, Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations. Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats didnt like Pryors views on womens issues and homosexuality. So they filibustered Pryor.

During a summertime adjournment (not amid the three-day, pro-forma theater discussed here), Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consent.

Democrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer, too. But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three days.

A new study shows the moon is likely to break apart before it hits the atmosphere, creating a debris ring that will encircle Mars for millions of years.

The research, published in this weeks Nature Geoscience, follows a report earlier this month that not only is Phobos losing altitude due to Mars gravity, it also already is showing signs of structurally stress from tidal forces.

NEWS: Mars Moon Phobos Is Double-Doomed

Phobos survived a giant impact early in its history, but damage from the crash left the moon weak, say Benjamin Black and Tushar Mittal, planetary scientists with University of California at Berkeley.

Their study shows that in 20 million to 40 million years, Phobos will break apart, leaving a cloud of debris that will relatively quickly assembly into a ring around Mars.

Initially, the ring will be as dense as Saturns rings today, and it will last for up to 100 million years, the study shows.

For Earthlings, Phobos demise presents a unique opportunity to study what may be the solar systems last inwardly migrating moon.

Inwardly migrating satellites  some of which may break up tidally, some of which may collide with their primaries  are likely to be an under-appreciated and important component of planetary evolution, the authors note.

Phobos offers the last possible glimpse of the signatures and processes that applied to inwardly migrating moons and the interplay with ring formation early in our solar systems history.","[]"

Sources close to the fight confirmed the news to FOX Sports following an initial report on Twitter on Saturday. Arlovski also confirmed the news via his Instagram account as well.

The fight will certainly be an odd twist for the heavyweight contenders, considering they typically train side by side under the tutelage of coaches Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn on New Mexico.

All signs indicate that Overeem and Arlovski will continue to train at the gym to prepare to face each other, although chances are they won't actually be working together.

The fight is a chance for Overeem to compete at home after signing a new multi-fight deal with the UFC recently while looking to build on a three-fight win streak.

Most recently, Overeem dispatched former UFC heavyweight champion Junior Dos Santos for his biggest win since joining the UFC roster.

As for Arlovski, the former champion will look to bounce back following a disappointing outing in his last fight, where he felt to Stipe Miocic at UFC 195.

Prior to that fight, Arlovski had won six in a row, including four bouts in the UFC.

The UFC will land in Rotterdam in the Netherlands for the first card taking place in the country. With a lot of fighters training in the area, chances are the requests to compete on this show will keep matchmakers busy over the next few weeks.","[]"

But NASA said January stood out: The temperature was above normal by the highest margin of any month on record.

And January set another record: Arctic sea ice reached its lowest point for that ice-building winter month.

NASA said January 2016 was 2.03 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates temperatures differently, said last month was 1.87 degrees, which is the second biggest margin in history. NOAA said the greatest was this past December.

January's average global temperature was a record 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit, easily beating the old January record set in 2007, according to NOAA Records go back to 1880.

There were colder-than-normal patches in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in January, but they were overwhelmed by incredible ""off our chart"" warming in the Arctic region, according to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. Siberia, northwest Canada, and a lot of Alaska were at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, she said.

That heat was why there was record low sea ice in the Arctic for this time of year, when sea ice grows, Blunden said.

January Arctic sea ice averaged only 5.2 million square miles in January, which is 90,000 square miles below the previous record set in 2011, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's also 402,000 square miles  about the size of Texas and New Mexico, combined  less than the 30-year normal.

The string of nine consecutive record hot months matches June 1997 to February 1998, which was the last time Earth had a large El Nino. It is still behind the 10 straight months of record heat in 1944, Blunden said. It's likely we'll tie that record in February, she said.

The current El Nino  an occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather around the world and spikes global temperatures  is tied with 1997-1998 for the strongest on record, according to NOAA. And while it has been predicted to ease soon, it has not lessened yet, said NOAA Climate Prediction Center deputy director Mike Halpert.

NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt blamed the record heat mostly on man-made climate change, with an assist from El Nino.","[]"

As the San Francisco Chronicle reports, that insight comes from an analysis of the stomach contents of mountain lions legally killed last year. Of the 83 cougars analyzed, 52% had recently dined on a dog, a cat, or another domestic animal.

The true percentage is likely higher, however, because the contents of 18% of the stomachs were too digested to make a determination. As for deer, considered a menu staple, a measly 5% of the mountain lions had eaten one.

One resident of Vista can attest, blaming a mountain lion for killing his Lab mix one morning earlier this month.

On that question, those of us who knew him and knew his deep respect for the place of politics in our constitutional order know that he would have been the first to remind us that the president may nominate his replacement, but the Senates power to consent, or not, is equally important and equally to be respected.

Far more important than that immediate question, however, is whether Justice Scalias legacy of respect for the written Constitution and the limited government it authorizes will continue to animate the nations highest court, or whether instead the Court will join the political branches as handmaiden and move us ever closer to the vision President Obama and his party have been pushing now for nearly eight decades.

We need only look to those of Mr. Obamas persuasion who would succeed him for the particulars of that vision. Driven by identity politics and class warfare, and informed by a medieval understanding of economics, they would make America look like the rest of the worlda world from which so many of us have fled. They rail against our present economic straits, especially for the young, yet would only double down on the very policies that have brought us here and so endanger our future. Answering always the same, their solution for government created problems is more government programs.

Justice Scalia had little patience for that vision, but he was a study in judicial evolution. He arrived at the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982 a staunch friend of the free market but also a strict disciple of judicial restraint, the view then animating conservatives that judges should defer to the political branches in all but the clearest cases of constitutional abuse. Thus, in a famous debate two years later with his former University of Chicago colleague, Richard Epstein, over whether judges should better protect economic liberty than they had done in recent decades, Scalia argued that that should happen only if facilitated by the creation of a constitutional ethos of economic liberty, which he did not see. Rising to the occasion, Epstein pressed Scalia to pursue, energetically, the tasks that our Constitution assigns to him.

And so the issues were joined in a struggle that had begun a decade earlier at Chicago and would continue to the presentbetween conservatives urging judicial restraint, against the excesses of the Warren and Burger Courts, and libertarians urging judges to engage more fully in enforcing the Madisonian vision of constitutionally limited government. As that debate evolved increasingly in the direction of greater engagement, so too did many of the judges Presidents Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43 appointed, including Justice Scalia.

In 1993, for example, Scalia joined us at Cato for an informal luncheon discussion where I asked him if the Court was ever going to revive the doctrine of enumerated powers as wed been urgingthe bedrock principle that Congress has only limited, enumerated powers, the rest belonging to the states or the people, as the Tenth Amendment says. Oh we lost that battle a long time ago, he responded. Yet two years later the Court held, for the first time in 58 years, that Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate commerce when it enacted the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1990and Scalia was on the right side of that 5-4 decision. And two years after that he would write the 5-4 opinion holding that Congress had no power to dragoon state officials into carrying out federal functions.

Justice Scalias federalism was not entirely consistent. Nor did he ever wholly embrace the vision of constitutional liberty that many of us have urged. He is famous, however, for holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. That again was a 5-4 decision, as often were his property rights rulings. Thus, he held that South Carolina could not provide its citizens with various goods by prohibiting a man from building on his property, the result of which was to wipe out the million dollars hed paid for it. Shockingly, four justices would have allowed thatthe same four, ideologically speaking, who would have allowed government restrictions on religious liberty, school choice, campaign finance, and so much more.

Today, the complaint about an activist Court more often comes from progressives who see that branch as impeding their plans for ever more government. Mr. Obama should know: more than any other administration, his has lost before the Court more than half the time, many of the most important cases by a single vote. Is it any wonder that he wants to fill Justice Scalias seat as quickly as possible, or that he is already trying to shame Senate Republicans against a filibuster, the very tactic he himself employed against then-Judge Samuel Alito? And that was not a lame-duck year.

Given the profound implications for the nations future of this presidents filling this seat, it is imperative, especially after the people spoke so clearly in 2014, that they be allowed to speak once more about our future before this seat is filled.

First, Jennifer Aniston is offered a lowly bag of peanuts, then shes shocked to discover theres no shower onboard the aircraft. The flight attendants deliver the final blow when they tell Aniston that- horror of horrorstheres no aircraft bar.

Of course this is all just a dream and she soon awakens in her luxurious walnut-paneled, flat-bed seat of an Emirates superjumbos first-class cabin, bristling from the nightmare.

The U.A.E. based airline says it spent $20 million on the spot, and it will be first be screened in the U.S. before being rolled out across Europe in 30 and 60 second versions, reports Bloomberg.

Though the ad is meant to be humorous, its struck a nerve with many YouTube users who point out that few travelers could actually afford the lavish experience depicted in the commercial. A round trip, First Class ticket from New Yorks John F. Kennedy to Dubai starts around $25,000.

NASA must pick 1 goal for astronauts, experts tell Congress","[]","NASA can't afford to put humans on Mars while also pursuing missions to put astronauts back on the moon, according to a panel of experts who testified to the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Space Wednesday.

""Today the future of NASA's human spaceflight program is far from clear,"" said Tom Young, former director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""There has been continual debate about should we go to the moon or Mars or both ... It is clear, again, that we cannot do both. And there is a need to focus our attention, capability and resources on one option.""

NASA has been advertising its ""Journey to Mars"" campaign, with NASA Administrator Charles Bolden saying that humans could go to the Red Planet as early as the 2030s. But in addition to the technological and fiscal hurdles, the three panelists agreed that without a solid plan in place, none of the proposed human-spaceflight goals would come to fruition. [5 Ideas for Manned Missions to Mars]

Target: Mars

""In the current fiscal environment, there are no good pathways to Mars,"" said John Sommerer, retired director of the Space Department at Johns Hopkins University.

Sommerer contributed to a report that Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to assemble, which looked at the feasibility of human spaceflight endeavors. The results of its investigation were released in a report called ""Pathways to Exploration,"" in 2014.

The report concluded that ""the first crewed Mars landing might be possible 20 to 40 years from now, after a cumulative expenditure on the order of half a trillion dollars,"" Sommerer said.

If the current budget of $9 billion spent on human spaceflight ""remains constant, with the addition of inflation,"" Young said, then approximately $180 billion ""with today's spending power"" will be spent on human spaceflight over the next two decades.

""Just as it is not feasible to take a cross-country trip on a child's allowance ... we may well never be able to get to Mars at current expenditure levels,"" Sommerer said. ""It might be better to stop talking about Mars if there is no appetite in Congress and the administration for higher human spaceflight budgets, and no willingness to cut programs that do not contribute to progress.""

Subcommittee member Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., spoke enthusiastically to the panel about the possibility of a human mission to Mars, and pointed out some of the young people in the room who might be the ones to go to Mars. He showed the panel a bumper sticker that read ""Mars 2033: We Can Do This."" He pressed Sommerer to confirm that, if given a sufficient budget, NASA could put humans on Mars in only 17 years.

""If you give [NASA] the date, and the money, and help with the discipline, the answer is yes,"" Sommerer said. ""If any of those three things is missing, the answer is almost certainly no.""

Mo Brooks, R-Ala., noted that the United States is currently facing serious budget concerns. He mentioned the Constellation program  which aimed to put humans back on the moon by 2020, but which was defunded in 2010  and asked the panelists to talk about how to avoid putting money into missions that would ultimately not come to fruition, and what lessons could be learned.

Young spoke about the desire to have fewer ""tombstones"" for cancelled projects and more ""memorials"" to successful ones. He reiterated the thesis of his opening remarks, that what NASA needs more than anything is a concrete plan for how it should proceed.

""I am personally passionate about humans going to Mars, but I'm equally passionate about a good, disciplined plan that is not frivolous,"" he said. ""A plan that does what is required, but also ... doesn't just do what's possible.""

In a response to Brook, Sommerer brought up the possibility of defunding human spaceflight and relying entirely on robotic missions, which are ""much more cost effective.""

""That's a choice that, in really grim financial straits, the country might be forced to make,"" Sommerer said. ""But it doesn't seem to be something people want to stand up and proudly say, 'Let's end the human space endeavor and rely on only robots.'""

He added, ""Although the robot stuff is pretty cool.""

To the moon

The third member of the witness panel was Paul Spudis, a senior scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute at the Universities Space Research Association. Spudis' research is focused on the geology of the moon. In his opening remarks, Spudis laid out reasons why NASA and humanity should not only return humans to the surface of the moon, but also develop an entire infrastructure in cislunar space (the space between Earth and the moon) that would include ""transport vehicles, staging nodes, deep-space habitats, power stations and fuel depots.""

In the journey to send humans to other planets, a pit stop at the moon might to be the right way to go, Spudis argued. A moon base might help humans develop technologies and know-how to survive on Mars. Humans could potentially harvest resources from the moon, like water, which can be used to keep humans alive  as well as broken up into oxygen and hydrogen to fuel spacecraft. Having access to those resources could make a trip to Mars more feasible, he said. (This is a discussion going on in congress for some time).

""America's space program is in disarray,"" Spudis said. ""What we need is a logically arranged set of short-term, realizable space goals that are not only interesting in and of themselves, but whose attainment will build capability in the long term.""

Spudis also spoke about the need to have crewed spacecraft that can be used to visit satellites that humans are relying on more and more for communications and other daily services, such as GPS.

""Many of these satellites are national security assets. Satellites upon which we are critically dependent,"" Spudis said. Currently, when those satellites break, often the only option is to let them die and replace them, Spudis said.

""If we could move people and machines throughout various locales in cislunar space, we would be able to replace, construct, upgrade and maintain satellites,"" he said.

Spudis also said that China is developing the ability to ""travel throughout and loiter within cislunar space,"" which might enable the country to disable satellites belonging to other countries. Such a move would put the United States at a disadvantage if it didn't have the same capabilities, he said.

A cislunar program would also offer NASA a set of goals that could be obtained on much shorter timelines than a human mission to Mars. The appeal of financing a set of shorter-term goals, rather than a single, long-term goal, was echoed by subcommittee member Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who expressed concern at the prospect of investing in a human Mars mission, only to have it set aside if a more pressing priority arose.

Moving forward

It is highly unlikely that the United States would be able to afford to simultaneously pursue a human mission to Mars while also deploying human missions to the moon or cislunar space, said Young during his testimony.

If congress decided to push for NASA to pursue a human mission to Mars, Young said, the agency would need to develop a specific plan in the near future ""that takes us from today to humans on Mars."" He listed a dozen things that such a plan would need to address, including defining intermediate missions that would be needed to prepare for a Mars trip, assessing risk, getting an idea of the resources that would need to be allocated and applying those resources ""in the most effective manner.""

""An argument against a plan at the current time is that we are not ready to finalize the necessary elements of the plan,"" Young said. ""I believe a strength of NASA program management is to establish a plan relatively early, with the recognition that as new information becomes available, the plan can be changed.""

""We have our work cut out to us,"" subcommittee chair Brian Babin, (R-Texas, 36th District) said in his closing comments. ""I agree that whatever NASA puts their mind to we can do. But we do have the parameters of an almost 20 trill dollar national debt that we have at this time. ... I think we have our marching orders. We just have to get organized on this.""","[]"

But if the U.S. starts seizing more militants in expanded military operations, where will they go, who will hold them and where will they be tried?

Those are questions that worry legal experts, lawmakers and others as U.S. special operations forces deploy in larger numbers to Iraq, Syria and, maybe soon, Libya, with the Islamic State group and affiliated organizations in their sights.

Throughout Obama's presidency, suspects have been killed in drone strikes or raids, or captured and interrogated, sometimes aboard Navy ships. After that, they're either prosecuted in U.S. courts and military commissions or handed over to other nations.

Winds from Cyclone Winston, which tore through the Pacific Island chain over the weekend, reached 177 miles per hour, making it the strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere since record-keeping began, according to the Weather Underground website.

Although the weather calmed Sunday, a curfew was extended through early Monday and police were empowered to make arrests without a warrant to ensure order.

In a televised address to the nation Sunday, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said many people had been left without power, fresh water or communications.

""The damage has been widespread, homes have been destroyed, many low-lying areas have flooded, and many people have been left stunned and confused about what to do,"" he said.

He said that the police and military had been brought in to help with rescue operations and the general cleanup, and that government agencies were working overtime to clear roads and restore power.

""This is a time of sorrow, but it will also be a time of action,"" Bainimarama said. ""We will stand united in the face of this disaster.""

Officials were trying to establish communications and road access to the hardest-hit areas, and said they would not know the full extent of the damage and injuries until then.

George Dregaso of Fiji's National Disaster Management Office said that two people on Ovalau Island died when the house they were sheltering in collapsed on them, and that another man was killed on Koro Island, although it wasn't clear how.

Authorities also said three people on the main island of Viti Levu were killed in the storm, but didn't have more details.

Tourism Minister Faiyaz Siddiq Koya said that all tourists in Fiji were safe and that there was no significant damage to the majority of hotels on the main island. Fiji is a popular tourist destination, known for its beach resorts and scuba diving.

Cyclone Winston hit Fiji on Saturday and moved westward overnight along the northern coast of Viti Levu. Fiji's capital, Suva, located in the southern part of the main island, was not directly in the cyclone's path and avoided the worst of its destructive power.

""Truth be told, we've gotten off pretty lightly here in the capital,"" said Alice Clements, a spokeswoman for UNICEF. ""It was still a pretty awful night. You could hear crashing trees and power lines, and popping rivets as roofs got lifted and ripped out.""

She said there was foliage everywhere that looked like it had been put through a blender.

About 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 people were without regular power, although about one-third of them were able to get some electricity from generators, said Dregaso, the disaster office official. Landlines throughout Fiji were down, but most mobile networks were working.

Dregaso said there were 483 people who had evacuated from their homes and were staying in 32 emergency shelters. He said he expected the number of evacuees to rise.

Authorities were urging people to remain indoors as they cleared fallen trees and power lines. They said that all schools would be closed for a week to allow time for the cleanup, and that three universities would be closed until further notice.

The government declared a 30-day state of natural disaster, giving extra powers to police to arrest people without a warrant.

The government said the curfew would end at 5:30 a.m. Monday.

""The curfew has been imposed to protect lives and protect property,"" Prime Minister Bainimarama said in his address.

Clements, the UNICEF spokeswoman, said there was particular concern for people on the northern part of the main island and on smaller islands. She said that many would have lost their homes and livelihoods, and that some tourist resorts on the outer islands may have been damaged.

The airport reopened Sunday to allow emergency flights, Dregaso said, after many flights had been canceled the day before.","[]"

A new study says horses can, offering evidence for the first time that they can recognize when someone is happy or angry from looking at our faces. The findings suggests there is plenty more to learn about emotional expression across species.

In their Biology Letters study, researchers from the University of Sussex showed a group of 28 horses photographs of positive and negative human expressions  mostly of faces that looked really happy or very angry. The horses appeared to respond most to the angry faces, giving a sideways glance with the left eye to the photo  considered important because negative events are processed in the right hemisphere of the brain. Their heart rate also increased more quickly and they showed more stress-related behaviors.

What's really interesting about this research is that it shows that horses have the ability to read emotions across the species barrier, Amy Smith, a doctoral student at the University of Sussex who co-led the research, said in a statement.

Related: Dogs can detect emotion in human voices, study shows

We have known for a long time that horses are a socially sophisticated species but this is the first time we have seen that they can distinguish between positive and negative human facial expressions,"" she said. ""The reaction to the angry facial expressions was particularly clear - there was a quicker increase in their heart rate, and the horses moved their heads to look at the angry faces with their left eye.""

Karen McComb, who also was a co-lead author of the research, said the findings illustrate that horses may have developed this ability to read emotions over time.

Horses may have adapted an ancestral ability for reading emotional cues in other horses to respond appropriately to human facial expressions during their co-evolution, she said. Alternatively, individual horses may have learned to interpret human expressions during their own lifetime. What's interesting is that accurate assessment of a negative emotion is possible across the species barrier despite the dramatic difference in facial morphology between horses and humans.""

Smith and her colleagues said it was interesting that the horses had such a strong reaction to the negative expressions, and little to no response to the positive. They acknowledged that it could be influenced by the fact these were faces the horses had not seen before and that more work was needed to understand the response by age, gender and other indicators.

""This may be because it is particularly important for animals to recognize threats in their environment, Smith said. In this context, recognizing angry faces may act as a warning system, allowing horses to anticipate negative human behavior such as rough handling.""

Robin Foster, a horse behavior expert at the University of Puget Sound who was not part of the research, said the study was solid and the methods were simple and elegantreminiscent of the early studies of the expression and recognition of emotions in human psychology.

Horses are socially intelligent animals, but the simplest explanation or why horses in this study reacted to angry human faces (but not happy ones) is associative learningangry faces are linked to unpleasant or painful experiences, Foster told FoxNews.com in an email interview, though she acknowledged the study left room for alternative explanations.

""Alternatively the horse may have simply been checking in with the handler, who always stood on the horse's left side - which would also explain why the horse looked to the left more when happy face was presented,"" she said. ""There is good evidence that horses seek out the proximity of familiar people to cope with stress.""

The finding is the latest to demonstrate the connections between humans and animals. Dogs, for example, were shown this year to be able to recognize positive and negative emotional states in human. And last year, a study in Science found that the connections between humans and their dogs have the same biochemical basis as the mother-child bond, and it's strengthened by a loving gaze.

Horses, though, like dogs, have been domesticated for use with people, which means generation after generation of intentional selection means that animals with the most favorable human interactions have been retained and perpetuated through breeding, training, and use, Miami Universitys Allen R. McConnell, the president elect of the Midwestern Psychological Association, told FoxNews.com in an email interview.

Dogs, for example, are adept at reading their owners because of such self-perpetuating processes in self-selection, he said. Many dogs can read faces, detect stress through smelling cortisol, etc. The study looks reasonable (e.g., blind video coding, inferential statistics used), so it seems like its conclusions are sensible.","[]"

12:30 p.m.

Police say a fire has damaged a former hotel that was being converted into a refugee home in eastern Germany and two people have been detained after hindering firefighters' work.

The blaze at the roof of the building in Bautzen, in the eastern state of Saxony, broke out early Sunday for reasons that remain unclear. Police said no one was injured, but a group of people gathered outside, some of them ""commenting with derogatory remarks or unashamed joy"" on the fire.

The fire came three days after an incident elsewhere in Saxony in which a mob screaming ""Go home!"" blocked a bus carrying asylum-seekers outside a refugee home. Police drew criticism in that case for hauling some migrants off the bus, which they insist was necessary to prevent the situation from escalating.

11:15 a.m.

Greek police say Macedonia has closed its southern border with Greece to Afghan migrants, allowing entry only for Iraqis and Syrians.

Macedonian authorities reportedly said that Serbia has done the same on its southern border with Macedonia.

Macedonian police started restricting the flow of migrants across the Greek-Macedonian border Saturday, conducting body searches and demanding passports. Earlier, they had accepted Greek police's official documents attesting that an individual had been processed.

The moves have led to a buildup of migrants waiting at the Greek side of the border. Greek police said 800 were stranded at the border Sunday and another 2,750 were waiting in 55 buses nearby.

He said Russia has to talk with Iran and the Syrian government and the U.S. has to talk with the opposition and members of the International Syria Support Group.

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger admittted that he got emotional to the point of shedding tears on Friday, when tight end Heath Miller called him and broke the news that he was retiring after 11 NFL seasons.

""He told me it was official, that he was retiring,"" Roethlisberger told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""He thanked me for being his teammate and said how lucky he was to play with just one quarterback for all of his 11 years in the NFL. I told him he had it all wrong. I told I was the lucky one ...

""It's hard for me to talk about him. It really is. Where do you start? I could talk about him all day. But I don't know where to start.""

Big Ben and Miller formed a tight bond during their time with the Black and Gold, which included two Super Bowl wins in three appearances. In fact, Roethlisberger often referred to Miller as his greatest teammate.

""No doubt he was,"" Roethlisberger told the Post-Gazette. ""I've had a lot of great teammates, a lot of guys I could put up there. But what Heath personified as a player and a teammate? There's never been another like him. I've never known a more unselfish player.""

""I'd ask him if he was open on a play and he would say 'no'. Other receivers say they are open on every play, but he never did,"" Big Ben said. Then, I would look at the film and he'd be wide open. He always told me he didn't want me to have to worry about him.""

Heath Miller sounds like quite a guy. Can't blame Roethlisberger for getting teary-eyed. Unfortunately, none of us were there to witness him shedding tears. Though we at FOXSports.com imagine it would look a lot like this:

Q. My Internet provider is trying to get me to pay for a faster Internet connection. I already have a 20Mbps package. Should I upgrade?

A. It depends on how many people are using the Internet. A 10Mbps connection or more is enough for the average single user or couple. Unless you have an entire family watching online video, downloading huge files or playing online games, 20Mbps is probably as high as you need to go. Learn why Internet ""speed"" doesn't work the way you think, and make sure you're getting the speed you're paying for.

Dealing with a frozen computer

Q. My computer froze three times in two weeks. What should I do?

A. First, back up your information in case the computer is about to die. Next time the computer freezes, make a note of what programs were running. Restart and try those programs again. If you can narrow down a particular program, you have your culprit. Get more instructions for getting to the bottom of a freezing computer, including how to check for hardware problems.

Spot a phishing email attack before it's too late

Q. I just came within a hair of giving my Social Security number to a hacker. How can I get better at spotting trick emails sooner?

A. Don't trust any email that asks you to click a link, download an attachment or give out personal information. Period. It doesn't matter how urgent the email says the situation is. Instead, go to the company's website, get its contact information and call its customer service to verify if there's anything you need to do. Still not sure you can avoid this type of scam? Learn five things most phishing emails do that are a dead giveaway.

Improve your TV's picture quality for free

Q. I'm a little disappointed with my new TV's picture quality. Should I return it?

I use Windows 10 and OS X interchangeably on a variety of new PC laptops and MacBooks. While Im not going to make a blanket claim that one operating system is better than the other, I will say that OS X, in my experience, is the more stable of the two.



Arguably, Apple is better able to control the operating environment because it designs both the hardware and software. That said, here are a few (recent) Windows 10 pet peeves that can make it a more challenging OS to use day to day compared to OS X. Note that ""Windows"" in the context of this article does not necessarily imply Microsoft, as software issues can be attributed to software created by third-party software developers, the PC maker, or Microsoft.

Related: New 4-inch iPhone and 'iPad Air 3' get March release date, report says

Windows System hangs: a host of small annoyances like system slowdowns due to seemingly trivial software issues are nothing new to Windows users. One example of a quirk thats been particularly irksome for me is a right-click freeze. This happened on two late-model (new) PCs from two different top-tier PC makers  which means its a Windows problem, not a hardware problem. In short, if I right-clicked on the Windows desktop, I would get the spinning busy blue circle. This had the (very annoying) effect of hanging  i.e., slowing down  everything. It was a show-stopper for me. After some research, I solved this by diving into the Windows Registry (on both laptops) and making changes. But thats not something the average user will do.



Windows Processes weirdness: there are just too many examples to even begin to cover them all here. So, Ill focus on a very recent one that shows how a rogue process can cripple your system. One afternoon, all of the browsers I had open (Google Chrome, Firefox, and the Microsoft Edge browser) suddenly stopped loading pages. After being completely befuddled for a couple of hours, I decided to glance at the Windows 10 Task Manager under the Processes tab - I noticed that the CPU usage was maxing out  bouncing around between 98 percent and 100 percent, without falling back down into normal ranges. This is a red flag if youre doing relatively undemanding tasks. I solved it by isolating the problem process and disabling it. This immediately got the CPU percentage back to normal levels and all Web pages began loading normally. But it was time consuming to fix. And is your average user going to be able to figure something like this out? I wonder.



Microsoft Edge browser: while I was optimistic at first about the Edge browser, it has not worn well for me. Ive stopped (except on rare occasions) using it because it can't be used on other operating systems (just Windows 10) like Chrome and Firefox can. And its behavior on the two Windows laptops I use regularly is erratic. While all browsers can behave unpredictably, Edge is more prone to that behavior than other browsers.

Related: Samsung Galaxy S7 vs. iPhone 7 rumor roundup

After contacting Microsoft about the problems cited above, I was put in touch with a Microsoft support specialist, who offered suggested fixes. Because I had already fixed two of the issues mentioned above on my own, I focused on the Edge browser. The specialist took control of my computer for about 30 minutes and tweaked some settings and erased unnecessary temporary files, among other things. I won't know if his changes helped until I use Edge on a regular basis.



And OS X? While its not flawless, I just spent more than a month using a new MacBook, pretty much all day every day. It was a relatively problem-free experience compared to Windows 10. Ironically, the only consistent, thorny problem I had on OS X was with Microsofts OneDrive (Microsofts file hosting service) for OS X. (I also have had show-stopping problems with OneDrive on Windows 10 -- but I won't go into that here.)



Let me repeat, OS X is not flawless  it has its own gotchas as any operating environment does. And Windows is indispensable for running many critical business applications  not to mention gaming. But, for me, reliability is really important, if not paramount. And in that department OS X is the clear winner.

Related: iPhone 7 rumored to wow with killer camera, reports say

As a postscript, my experience obviously does not apply to everyone. And I plan to revisit the Windows 10 vs. OS X topic again. As, I said, this is not intended as a blanket statement about OS X's across-the-board superiority, just one aspect based on my own experience.","[]"

The former Florida governor and political scion told supporters in Columbia that he'd tried to stay true to what he believes. Still, he was lagging far behind in the primary in South Carolina, where his well-organized campaign was outmatched by insurgent billionaire Donald Trump, and Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.

""I'm proud of the campaign that we've run to unify our country and to advocate conservative solutions,"" a visibly emotional Bush said. ""The presidency is bigger than any one person. It's certainly bigger than any one candidate.""

The son of George H. W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush entered the race to huge expectations in June, and quickly fueled them with fundraising. Working with a super PAC that has supported his candidacy, Bush and allies raised more than $150 million by the end of 2015  far more than any of his GOP rivals.

However, Bush's presence in the race and fundraising potential wasn't enough to dissuade more than a dozen other Republicans from entering the race, including fellow Floridian, Sen. Marco Rubio.

Fundraising reports filed Saturday night show how dire Bush's financial situation had become.

His big-money super PAC raised just $379,000 in January, and most of that was from a single donor who'd also given the same amount to rival Marco Rubio. The group, Right to Rise, had blown through more than $85 million over the past nine months, largely on TV ads, bashing other candidates, most notably Rubio.

Meanwhile, Bush's official campaign  which provided basic funding for his travel and political staff  had less than $3 million in available cash as the month began. He had only been able to raise $1.6 million in January, despite a once-sprawling donor network.

Bush's failure to ignite was not simply a factor of the size of the GOP field. Bush, like others, was caught off-guard by the durable popularity of political outsiders  particularly Trump.

""I firmly believe the American people must entrust this office to someone who understands that whoever holds it is a servant, not the master,"" Bush said as he withdrew from the race on Saturday.

The final stage of Bush's campaign became an all-out bout with the outspoken real estate mogul  the two frequently referring to each other as a ""loser."" Bush took shots at Trump's lack of experience while Trump attacked Bush's family legacy, particularly the unpopular Iraq war waged by his brother George W. Bush.

Bush, meanwhile, offered himself as an experienced public executive and potential world statesman informed in part by his father's and brother's wartime presidencies. But it wasn't a case strong enough to translate into votes.

""I just don't see a third Bush presidency,"" Julie Michau of Beaufort, South Carolina, said Wednesday after attending a Bush event.

There were other problems as well. The policy-oriented Bush was overshadowed in early debates by Trump and Rubio, which dramatically slowed his early autumn fundraising.

Bush went on to finish sixth in the Iowa caucuses, but barely squeezed ahead of Rubio in New Hampshire for a fourth place finish. South Carolina was viewed as a last early voting state for Bush to make a mark.

Having previously kept his family at arm's length, Bush brought all family ties to the forefront ahead of South Carolina, where his father and brother both won primaries as they pursued the presidency. Ultimately, it wasn't enough.

But you dont need to have started aninternational career-ending media storm to have your online presence wreak havoc on your professional life.

In fact, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled in recent years that employers can justifiably fire you for comments you make on social media, even if they had nothing to do with work. Meanwhile, a 2015 CareerBuilder survey found that 48% of hiring managers have found something on a potential hires social media account (such as inappropriate photos or discriminatory comments) that caused them to pass on that candidate.

Yet, though most of us know that terrible tweets and Facebook faux pas can cause trouble, that doesnt seem to prevent the occasional slip-up. Plus, even if you monitor your activity, friends can quickly unravel your image by tagging you in questionable posts or pictures or leaving less-than-palatable comments on your account.

So what do you do if youre feeling a bad case of social-media remorse? We asked a few experts to outline the steps to take if you find you need to do some damage control and reclaim control of your online brand.

Step 1: Figure Out ASAP Whos Likely to See and Take Issue With Your Post/Tweet/Instagram

You attended an epic bachelor party on Friday night and, in a less-than-sober state, you captured the highlights on social mediaincluding that 3 a.m. trip to a racy club that would make your boss cringe. What now?

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

Youll want to assess quickly not only how many peopleand which onesmay have caught wind of itstat. If only one or two people saw it, but its the wrong one or two people, you still have a problem, says Miriam Salpeter, a social media strategist and founder of Keppie Careers.

If your faux pas happened on Twitter, you can use the apps analytics feature to see how many impressions a tweet has (i.e., how many users saw it) or engagements (i.e., how many times someone liked it or retweeted it, for example). Though it doesnt list the users individually, itll give you a sense of how viral the tweet became.

If your lapse in judgment happened on Facebook, you may be able to deduce which people likely saw your post in their News Feed. As Facebook explains it, what pops up on a users feed is influenced by who they engage with the most, as well as how many comments or likes the post generated. So if youre in the habit of liking your bosss Facebook posts, its much more likely she may have seen yours. But if you havent interacted with her in the last several months or dont see her show up much on your feed, you could (fingers crossed) be in the clear.

But the only way to be 100% sure someone saw your post is if you actually noticed that they commented on it or shared, liked or favorited it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. So ...

Step 2: Get Rid of the Evidence

We know, we knownothing is ever truly gone from the Internet, right? But still, the first line of defense would be to immediately delete said post, says Bill Fish, founder and president of ReputationManagement.com.

So heres a quick cheat sheet on how to do that across some of the most common social media platforms:

Facebook: Go to your Activity Log. From there, you can delete a post, hide it from your timeline or untag yourself from any questionable photos. (Better yet, ask your best buds if theyre willing to delete any photos of you that they posted.) For further control, you can enable your privacy settings to review posts or photos your friends tag you in before they hit your public timeline.

Twitter: Go to your tweets, open the offending tweet, choose the ellipsis symbol and hit Delete Tweet.

Instagram: Go to the incriminating photo, tap the ellipsis shown beneath it and hit delete.

LinkedIn: Go to the regrettable update and hover your cursor over the time stamp on your update. Youll see the option to delete in the drop down menu.

Google+: Click on the post you wish never existed, click on the menu icon (the three vertical dots) and select delete from the drop-down menu.

Depending on how bad your social media slip is, you might be tempted to delete your entire accountbut unless youre being threatened, that might be an extreme move. Shutting down an account admits defeat and basically looks like you are hiding from the issue you caused, says Fish. Why delete any good will you have built with your posts over the years? Simply go in and scrub your account to get rid of anything that could be offensive.

Of course, that doesnt necessarily mean that what youre trying to cover up wont live on in screenshots, shares or similar photos from oblivious friends who cant stop trying to relive the moment. This means you may have to keep doing some digital triage (more on that later).

Step 3: Apologize, As Needed

As weve just discussed, theres no way to fully know who saw what, so keep your eyes and ears peeled to see whether youre the talk of the water cooler come Monday morning. Workplace gossip likely makes it clear who saw your unfortunate post. However, if youre unsure, dont stir up trouble by asking questions that may lead to more problems, advises Salpeter.

In other words, thinking youre doing right by blurting out an apologyin real life or onlinecould generate even more publicity about your slip-up to folks who may not even know what youre talking about.

But what if you do get pulled into the bosss office with raised eyebrows?

Then its time to take full responsibility, says Fishand it is imperative that you do not use phrases like If I offended someone ...  The only reason you are making this apology is because you offended someone, so as difficult as it may be, admit you were wrong and offer a heartfelt apology, he adds.

Salpeter adds that an in-person or phone meeting is probably best for an apology. I would advise making the effort to engage live with a supervisor instead of trying to explain something via email, where tone is lost and it can be difficult to avoid the appearance of trying to justify an inappropriate scenario, she says. Then, of course, assure them that youll exhibit better judgment down the road.

Step 4: Scrub Your Social Media

For starters, go back to your normal posting schedule (although youre going to think twice and only publish things that are safe for workright?). This is especially helpful if you dont think youve gotten rid of all the vestiges of your questionable decisions.

There are no guarantees when it comes to burying a bad post, but unless people make a point to keep sharing and referring to your mistake, the post itself will be buried in no time if you post other updates. People are less likely to scroll through your content than you think, Salpeter says.

Personal security expert Robert Siciliano also recommends ramping up your privacy settings on all social media accounts to prevent unwanted retweets, shares, likes or posts. Then comb through your previous posts to remove anything that could tarnish your image. For instance, duck-face mirror selfies and party pictures are a major red flag, Siciliano says, as are any insulting or negative comments you may have left on other peoples posts. One final caveat: Never drink while posting. While PUIsposting under the influenceare legal, you could regret it, he says.

Finally, take a moment to search for yourself online to see what shows up in the results. Use all of the popular search engines, such as Bing and Google, he suggests. View the search results when youre logged in and out of your browser, as this can alter the outcomeresults can be different depending on many factors, including the type of web browser youre using, geographic location, web history or the data center that is serving up the search results.

If truly false or unflattering results appear, you can request to remove the page from Google search results by going here. However, keep in mind that a search engine may only remove the page if it proves to hold sensitive personal information, is sexually explicit or is in response to a legal request, such as copyright infringement. If its just your old Spring Break photos, youre probably out of luck.

In that case, your best defense is to strategically focus on rebuilding your online image.

Step 5: Reinvent Your Online Self

It only takes a moment to post a potentially career-threatening faux pas on social mediaand far longer to create a positive and professional online image. But there are ways to expedite the process. Our mantra is to take up as much search engine real estate as possible, says Fish. Creating [business] social accounts across multiple platforms will be in your best interestbut you can also take it a step further.

First, create a simple website for yourself. Try to reserve a domain name thats as close to your name as possible, suggests Fish. The site may only house your resume at first, but its a step toward building a professional brand online. Online portfolio sites like flavors.me or About.me are also good places to start, suggests Siciliano.

Then, create professional-only social media accounts. Link to them from the homepage of your new site. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ seem to be given the most preferential treatment on Google these days, says Fish. Keeping your posts intelligent on those platforms gives you the best chance to succeed. Once you start to get a bit of a following, your website and connected social media accounts should gradually begin to appear on page one of Google when someone searches your name.

We believe this is the first time a person using a mind-controlled prosthesis has immediately performed individual digit movements without extensive training, senior study author Dr. Nathan Crone, neurology professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a news release.

Details of the feat, published this week in the Journal of Neural Engineering, may offer a model that would one day help individuals who have lost limbs regain movement. The Amputee Coalition estimates there are more than 100,000 Americans living with amputated hands or arms.

This technology goes beyond available prostheses, in which the artificial digits, or fingers, moved as a single unit to make a grabbing motion, like one used to grip a tennis ball, Crone said in the release.

Study authors tested the technology on a young man with epilepsy being treated for seizures at Johns Hopkins. Although he wasnt missing an arm or a hand, researchers used brain mapping to bypass control of those limbs.

They recorded the mans brain activity namely, which parts were responsible for moving fingers through electrodes that were surgically implanted for clinical reasons. The signals also controlled a modular prosthetic limb developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

The study participants neurosurgeon implanted a rectangular sheet of film comparable to the size of a credit card on the part of the mans brain connected with hand and arm movements. The Johns Hopkins team developed a computer program that recorded which parts of the brain were activated when each sensor detected an electrical signal. They also used a glove with buzzers in the fingertips to collect data on tactile sensation. According to the release, they measured the electrical activity in the brain for each finger connection.

After compiling the motor and sensory data, researchers programmed the arm to help the patient move individual fingers based on which part of his brain was active. They wired the arm to the patient through the electrodes, and they asked him to try moving individual digits. Study authors did not train the patient prior to the study, and the total experiment took less than two hours.

The electrodes used to measure brain activity in this study gave us better resolution of a large region of cortex than anything weve used before, and allowed for more precise spatial mapping in the brain, lead study author Guy Hotson, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins, said in the release. This precision is what allowed us to separate the control of individual fingers.

Researchers said the prosthetic first had a 76 percent accuracy, but when they combined the signals for the ring and pinkie fingers, that rate increased to 88 percent.

The part of the brain that controls the pinkie and ring fingers overlaps, and most people move the two fingers together, Crone said in the release. It makes sense that coupling these two fingers improved the accuracy.

Crone said further research involving mapping and computer programming would be needed before the technology could be successful for individuals missing limbs.

As former governors, we are endorsing Governor Jeb Bush because he stands head and shoulders above the rest of the field in terms of having a proven record of delivering conservative reforms that empowered people to improve their quality of life. In Florida, Jeb set the gold standard that many of us looked to when bringing about conservative change in our states. Conservative columnist, George Will, declared earlier this year that Jeb Bush was the most consequential big state governor since Ronald Reagan. Will is right.

During Jebs governorship, Florida earned a AAA bond rating upgrade, saving taxpayers significant money. He cut taxes by $19 billion, balanced eight budgets, shrank state government by 11 percent and accumulated nearly $10 billion of budget reserves, protecting Florida from rainy day situations.

Governor Bushs leadership on the economy was also stellar. During his administration, Florida became the national leader in job creation and small business creation as 1.3 million new jobs were created and middle class incomes rose by $1,300.

Jeb also made Florida the national model for conservative education reform. He beat the teachers union to enact three statewide voucher programs and to nearly triple the number of charter schools in the state. Jeb focused on high standards for student learning and held educators accountable, driving significant improvements in student achievement that are illustrated by the fact that the high school graduation rate in Florida has increased by nearly 50 percent since the Bush school reforms were enacted.

Now that Governor Bush is a candidate for president he is offering concrete policy solutions that are rooted in the conservative principles he fought and won on in Florida. Jeb has the best plans to grow our economy at full strength to help ensure that the middle class receives the first pay raise in 15 years. He has the boldest ideas to reform the spending culture in Washington, fix the impending crisis with entitlements and balance the budget to bring the spiraling national debt under control.

Most importantly, Jeb is a strong leader with a steady hand who is ready to be Commander-in-Chief and keep our homeland safe. Jeb has been endorsed by 12 Medal of Honor recipients and more than 40 retired admirals and generals because he is a crisis leader who has been tested time and again. From 2004-2005, Florida was hit by eight major hurricanes and four tropical storms. Governor Bush led an unprecedented response and recovery effort that brought his state together and contributed to him leaving office with a 67 percent job approval rating.

To respond to an increasingly dangerous world, Governor Bush has outlined a detailed strategy to rebuild our military, destroy ISIS and address the growing threats presented by Vladimir Putins aggression in Eastern Europe; Irans ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon and Chinas military buildup and desire to become a dominant force in the South China Sea. Jeb understands what it takes for America to project power abroad and he will be a leader who will restore the trust of our allies, while striking fear in the hearts of Americas enemies.

While there are some very talented politicians running for the Republican nomination who are gifted orators, no one running can match the decision making ability of Governor Bush. Governors are different than Senators in one key way. We are held accountable for delivering results and cannot get away with offering amendments, issuing press releases and declaring victory. Jeb Bush is stand up and take-charge type of leader who will fight to forge consensus and break the partisan gridlock in Washington. We are confident that he would be a transformational president of the United States, paving the way for middle class families to achieve earned success and restoring Americas standing in the international community.

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. Allies united against ISIS. Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Jordan pounding ISIS targets this morning. The UAE back in the battle supplying more planes.

Now how should Americans add our own muscle to the fight against ISIS? We're covering this story throughout the program this morning with congressional and military guests.

The GOP presents its plan to erase ObamaCare.

Is it better? Is it likely to pass? We'll discuss the details of that and a lot more with Senator John Hoeven coming up.

And a full court press by the West to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict. How far did they get? We'll take a look and talk to a business man with an insider's view of just how corrupt post-Communist Russia really is. He barely escaped with his life. Others, not so lucky. He'll tell us his first-hand story as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(MUSIC PLAYING)

BARTIROMO: And Jordan continues to pound ISIS strongholds this morning, not believing the terror group's claim that a Jordanian airstrike has killed U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller.

Meanwhile the president plans to formally ask Congress to authorize the use of military force against ISIS in the coming days.

What should the U.S. response be now? Congressman Bob Goodlatte is with me, he's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and he joins us now.

Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.

REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Thank you, Maria.

BARTIROMO: So what should the U.S.' response look like, when we hear from the president to authorize the use of military forces, what do you think that force should look like?

GOODLATTE: I believe for a long time that the current authorization for use of military force in Iraq, now more than a dozen years old, is out of date, needs to be replaced. We should take a careful look at what the president presents to us, recognizing it's a good thing that Jordan and some of the Gulf states and others in the Middle East are recognizing they're on the front lines.

The threat is to them. And they should step up. We should support them and we should give the president appropriate authority to do that support.

Now one of the big questions, of course, will be what about boots on the ground?

Again, we've got to be careful not to tie the president's hands. But we do not want to have major U.S. military ground forces placed back in an area where we think others should be stepping up and taking the lead. But targeted strikes and rescue missions and a whole host of other activities, spotters on the ground and so on, we need to give the president some flexibility in this area. But we need to look carefully at an appropriate authorization of use of military force.

BARTIROMO: The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since August.

Has it worked?

GOODLATTE: I think it has definitely helped. There is no question that we've turned them back in a few places. We've seen some towns recovered by Kurdish forces and other forces in the area. But obviously more needs to be done.

I think that some of the terrorist acts that they have taken place, burning Jordanian air force officer in a cage, may be a reflection of their desperation more than it is simply their barbarity. But either way, I think this is a long-term battle against Islamic radical terrorists. And we need to make sure we're doing our part.

It's not just happening in the Middle East. FBI Director Comey said in Mississippi just a couple of days ago that they have active investigations of suspected ISIS collaborators in 49 states. So this is something we can't simply allow to say it's going to happen in someplace else and we don't need to be involved in it. We do need to be involved.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: Yes, Congressman. I wanted to hear more about that and I also want to ask you about the idea of cyber security and Internet terrorism. So stay with us, Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

First, let's dig deeper into the scope of Jordan's fight against ISIS. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins us now with that angle.

Good morning to you, Eric.

ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.

And good morning, everyone. It has a king who is also an attack helicopter pilot who did not hesitate to strike back. King Abdullah is leading not from behind, but from the front.

A monarch in a flight suit, a potent symbol of Jordan's defiance against ISIS, 53-year-old King Abdullah, who served in the Royal Jordanian Army and flew Cobra antitank helicopters in the air force, is now taking the fight directly against the ISIS killers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MOHAMMAD AL MOMANI, STATE MINISTER FOR MEDIA AFFAIRS, JORDAN: We will do whatever it takes in order to fight this organization and defeat this organization. We think this is the best of our country. Of course we strongly believe that other countries in the region as well as the international community must shoulder part of the responsibility.

SHAWN (voice-over): Jordan vows that a, quote, ""relentless war against ISIS"" and has carried out four days of continuing airstrikes in revenge for that barbaric burning to death of its pilot, despite being dwarfed by larger militaries. The country ranks number 67th, according to global firepower and military strength with a defense budget of $1.5 billion. It can field just over 110,000 active military personnel. The air force has 246 military aircraft, including 74 fighters or interceptors and 42 fixed-wing attack aircraft.

But like the U.S., Jordan continues to rule out sending so-called boots on the ground. Even though Iraq and Syria's Arab and Persian Gulf neighbors can potentially field armies of more than 1 million troops against the Islamic State. But for now have no plans to do that.

AL MOMANI: I think that nobody is talking about troops on the ground. The idea about boots on the ground is that we will help the Iraqi military.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SHAWN: But Jordan says since that unforgivable video was released, it has launched 56 strikes against ISIS and has so far flown 946 sorties out of a total of 5,500 coalition airstrikes or just under 20 percent. Scrawled on a Jordanian bomb that was hanging under a jet fighter just before a mission against ISIS was one simple message. It said, ""For you, the enemies of Islam."" -- Maria.

BARTIROMO: All right, Eric, thanks very much, Eric Shawn with the latest there.

More now with Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

And, Congressman, you have been a leader in terms of Internet and technology issues on your committee. Let me get your take on your expectations for cyber terrorism and whether or not this is an area that you think ISIS will next pursue.

GOODLATTE: Well, it is certainly something that various elements of terrorist organizations have pursued and the United States needs to step up its game. Greater cooperation between government agencies, greater cooperation between private companies and the government in making sure that cyber attacks of various kinds are repulsed. We need to make sure our intelligence organizations have the ability to gather the information they need but not at the expense of the civil liberties of law abiding American citizens.

We passed a good bill through Congress last year to take up again this year offered by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner that set, I think, the right guidelines, barred the government from collection of metadata but still gave them the opportunity to do what they need to do to gather the information to investigate terrorist plots that can take place in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, lay out the next two days for us when the president asks Congress for the authority for more military force.

How does this play out this upcoming week?

GOODLATTE: We should take that and look at it very carefully. I don't think we need to rush into giving a very quick response. Remember the president has had a mixed record here. He did not seek authorization for use of military force to go into Libya. Many complications have ensued from that.

He then sought the authorization to go into Syria against the current Syrian government. That got a very negative response from the Congress. I think there's more open-mindedness right now about finding the right balance here in terms of giving him the authority that he needs without us stepping out in front of these Middle Eastern nations like Jordan that need to take the lead in protecting their region and in fighting ISIS. But we should be strong supporters of what they're doing.

BARTIROMO: And Jordan is one of a handful of Middle Eastern countries that have joined the fight against ISIS.

Are you expecting that number to increase?

GOODLATTE: I certainly hope it will because they clearly are the ones who are on the front lines. This kind of radical terrorism is not what I think they want the world to see about the Middle East. There have been Muslim clerics around the world speaking out against the horrific acts taken by ISIS and we need to get their help in pushing back on this because this is a long-term problem with extremism trying to take hold, not just in the Middle East. We saw it in France just recently and we've seen it in the United States before and we'll see it again if we're not proactive in combating it.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for joining us today.

GOODLATTE: Thanks, Maria.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A group of congressional Republicans, Senators Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch and Congressman Upton have unveiled their place -- their plan to replace ObamaCare. It is similar to an outline proposed last year by Burr, Hatch and former Senator Tom Coburn.

It includes targeted tax credits for those living up to 300 percent above the poverty line, allowing insurance companies to sell plans across state lines, repealing the individual mandate. But, like ObamaCare, kids can stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 years old. And pre- existing conditions are covered, that is, unless you let your coverage lapse for a couple of months, under the GOP plan. Insurers could take that into account.

Senator John Hoeven is joining us. He is on the Appropriations Committee and the Energy Committee.

Senator, good to have you on the program.

SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, R-N.D.: Thanks, Maria. Good to be with you.

BARTIROMO: What is the viability of this new replacement to ObamaCare, do you think?

HOEVEN: I think it's a good plan. It's about empowering people rather than expanding government. And if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidy that states are getting under the federal exchange, we're going to have to have another plan. And I hope there's some support both in the Congress and on the part of the administration to go to this kind of approach.

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen so far from anticipation of ObamaCare or actual implementation of ObamaCare?

HOEVEN: I'm -- your question on the...

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen already in terms of businesses, in terms of the economy, people's lives?

HOEVEN: Yeah, I mean higher costs, not only for businesses but for individuals in terms of their health care insurance. And that's why the kind of plan that we're talking about now can create more competition and help bring health care costs down and gives people more choice.

BARTIROMO: What would you like to see in terms of other priorities for the budget?

The president released his budget. What is your response in terms of what he's likely to do in terms of raising taxes and -- and creating more revenue for things like education and infrastructure projects?

HOEVEN: Well, his budget is a real problem. And I don't believe it's going to go anywhere in Congress. If you look at it, it's $2.1 trillion in higher taxes. It's $2.4 trillion in more spending. It's $8.5 trillion over 10 years in more debt for this country. And that makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs and grow the economy. And so that's not what Americans want. That's why Congress is not going to go that direction. What we're going to try to do is do things like reduce the regulatory burden, engage in tax reform that stimulates our economy and encourages job creation for our businesses across this great country.

BARTIROMO: And how does this ObamaCare plan, or replacement plan, do that?

HOEVEN: Well, the -- it helps by giving more choice, more competition, reducing the regulatory burden -- again, not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs, giving them more options, but for individuals as well. That's the kind of thing that makes our economy go. When you make it easier to do business, then entrepreneurs, small businesses create more jobs. When you make it more expensive, you have higher tax burden, more regulation, that's what hurts job creation.

BARTIROMO: Senator, let me move on to the Keystone Pipeline, which I know you have been pushing passage for. But I want to start with North Dakota. Because North Dakota, of course, is a very big oil-producing state, producing more than a million barrels of oil a day, second largest oil producing state. What has been the impact on the state of this sharp sell- off in the price of oil that we've seen in the last year?

HOEVEN: Maria, we're starting to see some slowdown. Obviously, the price of oil now just a little over $50 a barrel. You know, actually, we're locked in a global competition to see who's going to supply energy globally. So OPEC, Russia, now the United States. You know, we're battling for market share. So we have to continue to help build our industry in this country. So far we've seen some slowdown in our state, not too much. How much more we'll see depends on what happens with the price.

BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, is it fair to say that the -- the rise in supply, whether it's the shale revolution in America or OPEC and non-OPEC countries, that's the reason oil prices have come down so much?

HOEVEN: Maria, without question, one of the things I often see is OPEC didn't decide to give us a Christmas present this year. The reason gas prices are lower, dropping over the last year from something like $3.27 a gallon down to about $2.17 a gallon is because we're producing so much more energy. And that's how it works. If we continue to grow our energy base in this country, we not only become energy secure but we reduce the price at the pump for our consumers. The benefit they've received so far would be, if it were a tax cut, would be equal to more than $100 billion in the consumer's pocket.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I mean, you have been talking about the importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and yet the president continues to say he is going to veto this. So these threats continue. What are you going to do if the president vetoes this in the next couple of weeks?

HOEVEN: You know, Maria, that's the great irony. We're producing more energy; it's strengthening our country; it's helping our allies; it's benefiting consumers and businesses, you know, throughout our economy.

And now the president, on the one hand, takes credit for it, and then, on the other hand, he is trying to block it. We need the infrastructure and we have to build the business climate so we can produce more energy, not less, here in North America. And then we don't have to depend on OPEC for oil, and we're stronger as a country and we have a stronger economy.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning the fact that the oil is going to get here by hook or crook. It's only going to come on rail cars as opposed to coming through a pipeline. And we're already seeing a real capacity congestion on the tracks, right, because oil is being transported on rail car?

HOEVEN: You make a great point. That oil is going to move either by rail or by pipeline. If it moves by rail, that's 1,400 rail cars a day which not only creates more congestion, more risk of accident, that kind of thing, but it also blocks our movement of other goods. The safest way to do it, the most cost-effective way to do it, with the best environmental stewardship, is with the proper infrastructure, the right mix of pipelines, rail and roads.

BARTIROMO: Senator, good to have you on the program. We'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much.

HOEVEN: Thanks, Maria.

BARTIROMO: Senator John Hoeven joining us.

Germany resisting calls to send weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed rebels. So what will it take to make President Putin change his ways?

An author who knows post-Soviet Russia inside and out is next, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Germany is balking at appeals by Ukraine for weapons to fight Russian-backed rebel separatists. Chancellor Angela Merkel expressing little optimism following the latest peace talks between Kiev and Moscow. My next guest knows firsthand just how corrupt post-Soviet Russia really is, having done business with some of its most powerful players. He is the author of ""Red Notice"", a true story of high-finance murder and one man's fight for justice. He is Bill Browder.

And it is good to have you on the program, Bill.

BILL BROWDER, AUTHOR: Good to see you.

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. First off, let's talk about the issues of the day. Ukraine needs help. Larry Summers was on this program last week basically saying it is more important for us to be doing helpful things for Ukraine like sending them armament than fighting Russia. Because, if you fight Russia, you're pushing Putin in a corner, and he is going to fight back even more aggressively.

BROWDER: Well, the first thing you have to know is that Putin started this war. Putin is doing this war for internal Russian domestic reasons. He's trying to distract his own population from his corruption. And so this war is not about any historic ties with Ukraine or about NATO. This is Putin aggressively attacking Russia (sic) to try to get people stirred up into a nationalist frenzy.

And so Putin will not back down in Ukraine. Anything that -- and there's basically nothing we can do to talk him into backing down, which means that the only choice we have in the West is to put pressure on him.

BARTIROMO: So do you think the U.S. should be aiding Ukraine with armaments?

BROWDER: Absolutely. I mean, so either we're going to have to go and fight Russia ourselves or let the Ukrainians fight Russia. But right now, they're getting slaughtered because Russia has an enormous amount of money to invest in military equipment; Ukraine has effectively run out of their military equipment and they need as much help as they can get.

And that's the one thing we can do without directly going to war with Russia ourselves.

BARTIROMO: All right. I want to talk about your story in particular. Because you really -- you have an inside, first-hand account. At one point in your career you were running money; you were an investment manager, and you were the single largest investor in Russia.

BROWDER: Yeah.

BARTIROMO: Tell us what happened?

BROWDER: So I was -- I was investing in Russia. I discovered that the companies I was investing in were run corruptly by corrupt oligarchs. We started to fight the corruption. That angered the -- that angered Putin and his cronies. I was expelled from the country. My offices were raided. They tried to seize my companies. And they ended up stealing $230 million of taxes that we paid.

I hired a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky to investigate. He discovered the crime, testified against the officials. He was then arrested, tortured...

BARTIROMO: In -- in Russia?

BROWDER: In Russia. He was arrested in Russia by the people he testified against. He was then tortured for 358 days in Russian custody and killed. And then, after they killed him, they then exonerated everybody involved and put him on trial, after he died, in the first ever trial against a dead man in the history of Russia. They put me on trial as his co-defendant. And we said to ourselves ""Russia is bent from top to bottom,"" after that, and looked for justice outside of Russia.

BARTIROMO: How do you know that -- and you think Putin ordered this killing of your lawyer?

BROWDER: I don't know if Putin ordered this killing, but I can say with 100 percent certainty that Putin has been involved in the cover-up of his murder. And we have evidence of that. So here you have the president of a country where his -- it wasn't my money that was stolen. It was his own tax money that was stolen from his own Treasury; $230 million stolen from his country. A young man tries to be patriotic. That young man is killed for exposing it. And then he's involved in the cover-up of that young man's murder.

BARTIROMO: So what does this -- your experience tell you about dealing with Putin and about dealing in, you know, post-Soviet Russia?

BROWDER: Basically, what this tells you is that Putin is a criminal, first and foremost. He's running a criminal enterprise to maximize profits. He's a criminal, but he's different than the Mafia of Italy or the Mafia of -- of New York in that he has all the powers of a sovereign state. He can arrest people; he can go to the United Nations. He has a -- he has his finger on a nuclear button if he wants to use that. So you have a Mafia boss with his finger on a nuclear button.

BARTIROMO: And yet you have this popularity ranking that keeps coming out, that the people love him. Is that a complete lie? Are they just afraid?

BROWDER: Well, let me ask you this. If you were living in Russia, a totalitarian state, and where bad things happen to people who oppose the president, and some stranger calls you up from the Levada polling agency and says, ""Do you support the president or not,"" what's your answer going to be?

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I -- I understand.

So where do you think this goes? In terms of Putin and Russia taking over Crimea, moving further into Ukraine, what are your expectations of how this plays out?

BROWDER: Well, so I think the whole thing is based on the fact that Putin is a kleptocrat and he needed something to distract the people. And so he needed to start a war to -- to get everyone whipped up into a big nationalist frenzy.

They're in a nationalist frenzy that -- and in response to that, there's an economic crisis because of sanctions. And so he's got to whip people into a further nationalist frenzy. And so I don't think -- so he's not going to back down from Ukraine.

And my fear, and I think this is very likely, is that he's going to start exploring his military ambitions in other countries. And the thing that's most worrying is the Baltics. Because the Baltics are part of NATO. And NATO is -- is an organization in which the United States and Europe are all treaty members, which means that, if he goes into the Baltics, we have an -- either an obligation to fight Russia to protect the Baltics or NATO falls apart.

BARTIROMO: Quite extraordinary. Bill, the book is ""Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and One Man's Fight for Justice."" Thank you very much for joining us, Bill.

BROWDER: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Bill Browder joining us here.

Up next, back to our top story, how should the U.S. respond militarily to ISIS at this point? Lieutenant General Dan Bolger is on deck, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: And back to our top story, as we await any word on U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller, what should the U.S. military response against ISIS be at this point?

Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger is the author of ""Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.""

Sir, good to have you back on the program.

Welcome.

LT. GEN. DANIEL BOLGER (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Hello, Maria.

BARTIROMO: What should the U.S. response be at this point?

The president will be asking for increased military authority against ISIS in the coming days.

BOLGER: Well, you -- you named one of the big things, and that's to get the domestic support of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives in Congress.

Real, real important because this is a long-term struggle.

Yes, you've seen some -- some accelerated air strikes in the wake of the death of the Jordanian pilot, Lieutenant al-Kasasbeh, a heinous execution done on film by ISIS. They don't do that just to be awful. They do that because it excites people and causes them to want to join ISIS, young -- young men, primarily, in that region.

It's a long-term struggle, Maria. And it means we've got to be in it for the long haul. And that's why that Congressional authorization is really important.

BARTIROMO: And, of course, Jordan has really stepped up, accelerating its response against ISIS.

How would you characterize Jordan's response?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, Jordan is a -- is a strong ally in that region. They're a front line state. ISIS is not something that happens around the world. It's right next door. They've got challenges right on their border.

They've had al Qaeda and ISIS operatives in their own country.

King Abdullah is himself military trained. He went to Sandhurst, the British military academy, the equivalent of our West Point. He's a -- he's a qualified Special Forces officer, he's a qualified pilot.

So when he gives the order for his -- for his military to retaliate against ISIS, he knows exactly what he's telling people to do because he's done it himself.

And I'll tell you the other thing that were not seeing. All these air strike videos are impressive, but what we're not seeing behind the scenes that's even more important is this strong effort to tigis -- target ISIS leadership.

ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was on our target list back when we were in Iraq in 2003 to '11, guys like him should to go sleep every night worrying that the door is going to get busted in and they're going to get shoot right between the eyes.

BARTIROMO: And -- and we do have the proper sort of intelligence to target that leadership, you think?

BOLGER: We're working on it. I'll tell you, this is where the Jordanians and the other states in the region come in. And they're very important.

Jordan has excellent intelligence services. Ours are good. We also have our other friends in that region to include the Iraqis and then the Kurdish militias that are part of Iraq.

Altogether, it's going to paint a picture that's going allow us to put that pressure and -- and threat to that ISIS leadership.

And it's going after their leaders that's going to -- going to do the most damage.

But again, a long, long effort. We're talking years before we see final results.

BARTIROMO: But the president is going to be asking for more military support.

Do you think that support should include boots on the ground?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, it already does. But the boots on the ground should not be Americans. We learned in our -- our campaign in Iraq in '03 to '11, as great as our young men and women are, it's very difficult for 100,000 Americans to lead a counterinsurgency and -- and build a successful state in the face of local rebels.

The right answer is for us to back the local people as they try and sort out their own problems. That's what the president is asking for. And to me, it shows that we have learned some lessons from what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.

BARTIROMO: You know, in the last two weeks or so, there has been a feeling that ISIS has become desperate, that, in fact, we have been effective in terms of, as you say, taking down some of the leadership.

But as a result, they have begun to falter.

Do you agree with that notion?

BOLGER: I do not. One of the things you've got to watch in a country like Iraq, it's natural for the enemies there to take a little bit of a break when the weather gets rainy, as it does in their winter there. It's not as extreme as winter in the Northeast United States, but -- but it's definitely a change of season.

You'll see an ISIS spring offensive. ISIS has strong presence in the Sunni Arab areas of -- of Syria and Iraq and -- and they're -- it's going to take a lot of work to get them out of there.

These -- these despicable actions they're taking against people like that Jordanian pilot, they're being done to allow for recruiting. I wish it was desperation because they were under pressure, but I don't think we're there yet.

BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.

General, we'll be watching.

Thanks very much for joining us today.

BOLGER: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger.

Now, let's get a look at what's coming up on ""MediaBuzz"" top of the hour with Howard Kurtz -- Howie, good morning to you.

HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Good morning, Maria.

We've got exclusive new details of the Brian Williams debacle at NBC, including that he decided voluntarily to take a leave of absence yesterday. He wasn't pushed to do so by NBC executives.

And there is no internal investigation at NBC. It's a fact-gathering inquiry to help the network play defense.

And as we look at whether he can survive this credibility crisis at NBC, it must be particularly fascinating for you, as somebody who spent two decades at that organization.

BOLGER: Well, it's interesting. So -- so but basically what I hear you saying, Howie, is that NBC is not doing anything.

The question is, will NBC's credibility continue to come down if, in fact, Brian Williams' credibility is on the line?

KURTZ: I think what's clear here is that Brian Williams has to do more to answer the questions not just about what happened in Iraq, where he has now acknowledged peddling a false story, but other questions being raised about other parts of his reporting.

If he can't do that, then NBC, I think, is going to have to make a very difficult decision.

BARTIROMO: Howie, we'll be there in 20 minutes.

Thanks so much.

We'll see you at the top of the hour.

KURTZ: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: Howard Kurtz.

The presidential candidates show their hands. Jeb Bush defines his platform in Detroit. Chris Christie tries to pick up some overseas cred in the UK. Our panel on how they did, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures.

Join us for the panel, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We dive right in. You can't paint 2016 right now and bring in our panel. Ed Rollins is former principal White House advisor to President Reagan. He's been a long time strategist and business advisor.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: And he's a Fox News political analyst.

ED ROLLINS, POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: My apologies, Ed.

ROLLINS: No problem.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh is the former press aide to Jack Camp when Camp was the GOP vice presidential nominee. He's now president of talk radio news service and a FOX News contributor.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum. He's the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and he is the former chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers.

Good to see everybody. Thanks very much for joining us.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Can you assess for us the current playing field for 2016, Ed?

Who do you think are the real candidates at this point on the GOP side?

ROLLINS: We have got the strongest field since 1980. We have four or five very serious governors and four or five senators who will probably make the race.

I think at this point, Bush obviously has picked up the pieces of the Romney departure. He's sort of going to be the establishment candidate. He's raising a lot of money, putting a good, strong team together.

Governor Walker is getting a lot of attention the last couple of weeks. And there's several other governors who will get in here, who will basically raise the money and be very viable candidates. I think it's a wide-open field and no one has a big lead at this point.

BARTIROMO: Chris Christie is trying to get some international --

ROLLINS: He had about the worst 30 days anybody can have. He bombed his London trip, where he went off to do foreign policy; he brought press along and then he wouldn't talk to press. He got trapped in the vaccination story, which overshadowed everything else. I think ""The New York Times"" had done a real job on him last week on his expensive travel and the fact that he's made (INAUDIBLE) for only one person can travel the way he travels and that's him, being hosted by kings and Boehner (ph). So it's just -- I don't think it was a good week for him.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh?

TONY SAYEGH: Well, the only person I think who enjoys the excesses of political luxury more is probably Hillary Clinton. And we know that's the case from reports continuing to come out. They've used The Clinton Foundation like their own American Express black card. So I think in the grand scheme of things, the report from ""The New York Times"" may have been to try to blunt some of the criticism that we're hearing more and more about Hillary.

But to Ed's point, I think the governor undeniably had a bad week. But I've watched him, I've observed him run two statewide races in a very overwhelmingly Democrat state. He's always seemed to manage his way back. He's a fight for sure. So I'm not ready to count him out.

But look, as far as international trips. You have Ted Cruz now in Munich in an international security conference; Scott Walker is going to England on a trade mission. Christie did a trade mission to Canada in December that was by far more successful. So these are all good maneuvers for them. But I don't think they really define their viability in terms of the field. And it's significantly early. Obviously I think Bush from the money perspective, the organization perspective, has the advantage. But you saw in the matter of two weeks Scott Walker from one speech in Iowa, the Freedom Forum, rise almost to nearly the top of the pack. He's leading polls in Des Moines, ""Des Moines Register"" So clearly this is a very fluent field but to Ed's point a very strong field.

DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Scott Walker was at the American Action Forum this past Friday, gave a major policy address. And I was very impressed with him. I think what we'll see over the next year is, as Ed said, a big field with lots of quality candidates sorting out who can sell the access to the American dream.

They're united in their belief in small government, better economic growth, keeping taxes under control, light regulatory burdens. But believing that and convincing the American people that you can deliver that are very two different things. And that's the challenge.

BARTIROMO: And that's the point that you were making, that you can try to sell the American dream, but if people don't really think they have a shot for it to be achieved, you can't sell it.

ROLLINS: The one thing Walker has done -- and he did in the Iowa summit -- is he said here is what everybody else says they're going to do. This is what I've done. That's a pretty strong record. And some of these governors, which I think are the stars of our party, we have 31 Republican governors who have really done some interesting things. They have to go out and explain what they've done and how they've done it. That it's about leaders. This is going to be a race about leadership, who's the strongest --

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: For sure.

SAYEGH: And I think Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit, while light on specifics, actually set the right kind of theme. Reminds me of my old boss, Jack Kemp; Ed's old boss, Ronald Reagan.

You have to have the typical compassionate conservatism that we've known from the Bush family to be a mantra. You have to be able to connect on a real level with the American people in a way that they trust you have their best interest at heart before they decide to agree with your policies. And that's something I think Barack Obama, while failing in every objective measure with the economy, with serving middle class and other things in 2012, was able to convince the American people to support him again because, compared to Mitt Romney, who seemed a bit patrician and removed from the day-to-day life of the average American, he had at least their best interests at heart. And that's where I think you heard a lot of in that Bush speech which is very important.

BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.

HOLTZ-EAKIN: For '16, the interesting thing is that -- you know, we were talking -- Hillary Clinton has that problem now. She's not exciting her base. And she may be a high quality candidate, but there's a whole lot of the progressive wing that are just not enthused about a Clinton candidacy.

BARTIROMO: By the way, you said she's using the Clinton Global Initiative as a black card?

SAYEGH: The Clinton Foundation, as we've learned through a lot of investigative reports, has a lot explaining to do. And I think that her and Bill Clinton both are benefiting greatly from the generous wealth and contributions of people from all over the world. Look, I'm not suggesting it's illegal.

But if you're going to criticize Chris Christie for staying at a hotel room that cost a certain amount of money --

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- thousand dollars.

SAYEGH: -- I think you got to look into Hillary Clinton and see the kind of (INAUDIBLE) she's shown that removes her from the American people. We've learned from her contracts -- which, I don't, again, begrudge her from doing to go to speak. She's making $300,000 but she's also stipulating I'll only talk to 45 people on the rope line. This is not the populist I think the Democrats need in 2016.

BARTIROMO: All right. Hold this thought. We're going to continue this conversation.

We also have some good economic news this past week. Jobs numbers are positive and even wages have begun to move.

But can this last? Our panel on that as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. We'll be right back.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our panel is back, Ed Rollins, Tony Sayegh, Doug Holtz-Eakin.

Doug, what was your assessment of the jobs numbers on Friday?

They were better than expected, and an interesting part of the report was that wages went up. Do you believe it?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: Taken at face value, this is a strong report and one that's long overdue, quite frankly. Some reasons to be nervous are January is always tough. There's a lot of seasonal adjustment. If you think of last January, we had huge storms that depressed the economy. You're comparing it relative to things like that. So a lot of this could be in the seasonal adjustments and not carry on to February.

I think the key is to look in February and see if we get sustained wage growth, see if we get sustained job growth, and see if we can continue to see people try to come back (inaudible) and get a job.

The -- you know, the bad story of this recovery has been more Americans not working because they have given up and they're out entirely.

BARTIROMO: Right, the participation rate.

SAYEGH: And the other bad story is you have a president boasting about economic growth, which, albeit, is important and a good indicator, but meanwhile the middle class is shrinking. So they're not growing with this economic expansion that is occurring, long overdue, of course.

And that's where I think the Republicans have a sincere opportunity this year to win back the middle class in this country electorally, realign them back to the Republican side, whose policies clearly benefit the average American much more.

I mean, we've talked about this before. The president's solution to everything is raise the minimum wage and somehow reallocate wealth from -- from the top to the bottom, when, really...

BARTIROMO: Redistribute...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's all zero-sum.

(LAUGHTER)

SAYEGH: It really is growing this economy in a way that good-paying jobs are created and people can take care of themselves and live that American dream that many people feel, unfortunately, is not attainable anymore.

ROLLINS: You still have, no matter what the labor department puts out, you still have very nearly one-fourth of the country, one-fourth of the workforce who are underemployed by their standards or unemployed. That's a big number.

BARTIROMO: And -- and what good is economic growth, as you put it, when the middle class is not growing with the economic growth?

ROLLINS: Many people have taken two jobs to replace the one job they used to have. And that's...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: The president's out of ideas on how to fix it. So, I mean, it's real clear. I mean, his budget says we're not going to grow faster than 2.3 percent over the long term. That's appallingly low, below what we are now. So it's going to get worse, not better. That's hard to believe.

And so there's only -- his only approach is to double-down on strategy of let's take it from one place, put it in another place. The Republicans in this cycle have an obligation to re-explain how economies grow and how people benefit from that growth. We can't remain at 2.3 percent and meet our national goals.

SAYEGH: And you're seeing this realization, particularly, I think, in Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit. You know, he's talking about not just economic growth, which is an academic economic term, some economic opportunity and why that's important. Because growth, to people, again, in an economy that's growing but they're not feeling the benefit, is relatively meaningless, number one.

Number two, we do want a party and we do want a country that provides a safety net for people in need, and this is another Bush, kind of, play on words. And instead of saying, you know, ""Let's not trap people in dependency,"" he used the term ""a spider web of dependency"" in which you're, kind of, connoting that, once you're in there, you're stuck.

We have a president whose policies have reallocated more people than ever from the middle class into lower income and into greater government dependency. That's the Obama economic record. That's why Hillary's in trouble in 2016.

BARTIROMO: And -- and the redistribution we saw, once again, with the president's latest budget.

ROLLINS: Absolutely. When you basically have the gigantic numbers we have in entitlement and a total inability to basically adjust any of those, whatever else you try and do, you're going to be dragged down.

BARTIROMO: You say Hillary is in trouble in 2016 because of this?

SAYEGH: Well, look, you look at a -- a poll that just came out several weeks ago from Washington Post/NBC. The most important number, not the head-to-head numbers -- her name ID is high; her favorability is generally very high because she's stayed our of the limelight -- 71 percent of Americans want a different direction than Barack Obama...

BARTIROMO: Right.

SAYEGH: ... and how is she going to now, in some way, shape or form, present a new policy, a new agenda that's different than the president she served for her full term?

BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break and then, still to come, the one thing to watch in the week ahead, on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" from our panel. Back in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Back with our panel. The one big thing to watch in the upcoming week. Ed Rollins?

ROLLINS: I'm watching the Ukraine situation. If the French and -- and Merkel can't basically make some resolve with Putin, we're going to push the sanctions and obviously it's going to have long-term effects. And I think, if we put troops or we put resources into Ukraine, we're going to basically start a Cold War.

BARTIROMO: Tony?

SAYEGH: I'm looking at Scott Walker's political stock. He's obviously on the rise, but this is also adding to more scrutiny from conservatives who, when they dig a little deeper, find that there are some things about the governor, who is very successful, obviously, in battling public-sector unions, that may not sit well with the conservative base.

BARTIROMO: I'll watch that, too. Doug?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: I'm watching to see if we can pass a bill in the House, a bill in the Senate, and send it to the president. That was the promise when Republicans took over the Congress and remains unfulfilled.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, you thought Keystone would fit the bill.

(LAUGHTER)

Gentlemen, thank you very much. Great panel.

I'm watching retail sales for the month of January. We will see if that cheap oil has in fact materialized with people spending money.

That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Thanks for being with us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. See you tomorrow on the Fox Business Network on ""Opening Bell,"" 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Take a look at where you can find Fox Business on your cable network.

The 61-year-old singer took to Twitter on Friday, after the Republican presidential candidate made ""botched"" comments about his late brother, Michael Jackson, who died in 2009.

""'Friends' don't pay tribute by peddling b.s. theories about Michael's 'loss in confidence,'"" Jackson tweeted. ""This fool Trump needs to sit down.""

""Michael's confidence was affected by the pressures, injustice and vitriol of external circumstances. Period,"" he continued. ""Name-dropping Michael don't make you cool and won't win you votes. Especially when using botched facts.""

During CNN's GOP town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday, Trump claimed he ""knew the real story"" about the legendary King of Pop, whom he considered a ""very good friend.""

""He was an unbelievably talented guy,"" the 69-year-old Republican frontrunner said. ""He lost his confidence. He lost tremendous confidence because of, honestly, bad, bad, bad surgery. He had the worst. He had people that did numbers on him that were just unbelievable. Facially, you know, the plastic surgeons.""

""He was an unbelievable talent who actually lost his confidence,"" Trump added. ""Believe it or not, when you lose your confidence in something, you can even lose your talent.""

Trump has yet to respond to Jackson's tweets.

Earlier this month, Michael Jackson's 17-year-old daughter, Paris, took to Instagram to slam haters for the ""f**king ridiculous"" expectations they have regarding her activity on social media.

""The expectations for my DAD were f**king ridiculous,"" she explained. ""He didn't owe you anything, yet he was ripped to shreds DAILY. I will not let that happen to me.""

The Latest from the Daytona 500 on Sunday (all times local):

Denny Hamlin is leading the Daytona 500 after 50 laps.

Hamlin took over the lead from Dale Earnhardt Jr. during the first series of pit stops.

Hamlin was out front and had several Joe Gibbs Racing teammates in tow, with Kyle Busch running second and Matt Kenseth fourth. Another Toyota, driven by Mart Truex Jr., was third.

2 p.m.

Pole-sitter Chase Elliott is out of the Daytona 500.

Just 19 laps into ''The Great American Race,'' the Sprint Cup rookie lost control of his No. 24 Chevrolet coming out of Turn 4 and slid into the grass infield. The front end of his car lifted off the ground, and the rough ride caused enough damage that his car had to be towed to the garage.

Elliott was transported to the infield care center, evaluated and released.

Carl Edwards and Regan Smith also were involved in the wreck, the first of the day.

''THIS IS DAYTONA!!!!''

Gerard Butler screamed the command to more than 100,000 fans, a tweaked version of the actor's famous ''This is Sparta'' line from the 2006 hit movie ''300.''

He gave the command for drivers to start their engines, and the Daytona 500 got under way a few minutes later.

Rookie Chase Elliott led the 40-car field to the green flag. Joey Logano is the defending champion.

1 p.m.

NASCAR executive Mike Helton brought some humor to the pre-race driver meeting, a traditionally staid ceremonial recognition of dignitaries that concludes with drivers receiving one final briefing before the race.

Helton one-by-one introduced all the Hall of Fame drivers in attendance, with 2015 inductee Bill Elliott last. Elliott is a two-time Daytona 500 winner and former NASCAR champion, and his 20-year-old son will make his Daytona 500 debut Sunday.

Chase Elliott replaced Jeff Gordon in the iconic No. 24 Chevrolet and put it on the pole for the 500, so Helton simply introduced his Hall of Fame father as ''Chase's dad.''

He also noted that Hall of Famer Glenn Wood is attending his 70th consecutive Daytona 500, but wryly noted that it's only the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.''

''They did race down there on the beach, though,'' Helton smiled.

The Daytona 500 is a star-studded attraction that draws all sorts of celebrities.

Here are some of the ones on hand:

Model Charlotte McKinney, rapper Wyclef Jean, TV personality Brody Jenner, actor Jason Biggs, actor Justin Bartha, actor Larenz Tate, Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Vincent Jackson, Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Paul Posluszny, and Washington Nationals outfielder and reigning National League MVP Bryce Harper.

Actor Gerard Butler is keeping his command to start engines before the Daytona 500 under wraps.

''My command? That's a surprise,'' he said. ''I have something up my sleeve, though, that I think you might like - or not. We'll see what happens when I get out there. I like living in the moment.''

One reporter impressed Butler with a tweaked version of the actor's famous ''This is Sparta'' line from the 2006 hit movie ''300.'' The reporter asked Butler if he considered opening with ''This is Daytona!''

''Now, I'm going to say, `No, no, don't be silly,''' Butler said. ''And then I'm going to go to the organizers and say, (can I use) `This is Daytona?'''

Ken Griffey Jr. says steroid-tainted slugger Barry Bonds deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.

Griffey is serving as honorary starter for the Daytona 500, where he will waive the green flag to start the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.'' Before he took his spot in the starter's stand Sunday, he met with the media and one of the first questions was about Bonds belonging in Cooperstown.

''Yeah,'' Griffey said after a long pause. ''I think that overall, when you look what people have done, yeah. It's not my vote, so I can't vote for him. But if you look at what he's done, those numbers speak for themselves.''

The polarizing home run king, Bonds is returning to the major leagues as hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Bonds is 0 for 4 in annual Hall of Fame balloting. He received 44 percent of the vote in January, a career high but far short of the 75 percent needed for induction.

Like Bonds, former home run king and admitted steroid user Mark McGwire also is back in baseball. He is the bench coach for the San Diego Padres.

Griffey declined to speculate whether being back in the game would help either one when it comes time to vote every year.

''I have no idea,'' Griffey said. ''My thing is I don't vote, so my opinion doesn't matter. It's up to the guys who do it for a living to decide what they want to do. I was honored by them voting for me. But it's up to these guys to determine if they get in or not. It's not up to me.''

As for the 500, Junior is going with Junior. Griffey and Dale Earnhardt Jr. have signed and exchanged items for charity over the years. Griffey even has a signed hood from one of Earnhardt's cars on display in his Orlando home.

''I've always been an Earnhardt family fan,'' Griffey said. ''I wore black batting gloves on Sunday when I played for the Reds.''

John Cena is driving the pace car for the Daytona 500.

But is the WWE star on the Road to WrestleMania?

Cena raised his right arm in an exaggerated motion roughly six weeks after undergoing shoulder surgery. The 15-time WWE champion refused to officially rule himself out of a WrestleMania match April 3 in Dallas.

''It would personally be unfortunate for me to miss WrestleMania,'' Cena said. ''But if I can't perform, it would be unfortunate to the people watching WrestleMania to see me try to suffer through something that isn't worthy of the event.''

Cena, whose catchphrase is ''You Can't See Me,'' joked that the drivers will, in fact, be able to see him in the Toyota Camry.

''I've installed a brilliant series of lights on top,'' Cena said. ''They will see me today, my friend. They will see me.''

Cena picked his friend Carl Edwards to win.

Cena will host the upcoming reality competition series ''American Grit'' starting April 14.

It's Daytona Day!

The 58th running of the Daytona 500 is Sunday, and although rookie Chase Elliott is on the pole, Hendrick Motorsports teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. is considered the man to beat in ''The Great American Race.''

Earnhardt and his car nicknamed ''Amelia'' have been nearly unstoppable at recent restrictor-plate races. Junior has four wins in six races with Amelia over the last 13 months.

Earnhardt says his team has been talked up quite a bit this week but he hopes people don't underestimate the competition. He says a lot of cars and drivers are capable of winning.

Driver Denny Hamlin believes only a handful of teams are capable of winning Sunday. Hamlin and his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth, Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards are among Earnhardt's toughest competition. Team Penske drivers Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano also are expected to contend.

Apple vs. FBI is getting weird","[]","The battle between Apple and the FBI is heating up after yesterday's ""no"" from CEO Tim Cook to a court order to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernardino terrorists. Now, no less than Edward Snowden has weighed in on Twitter, calling the situation the ""most important tech case in a decade."" He also called out Google's initial silence on the matter, and said the case was being closely watched by Chinese authorities.

Forbes says that the FBI could resort to using the fingerprint from the phone owner's cadaver, or use a fingerprint copying hack that's been posted online and seems to work. But if the phone has been locked for more that 48 hours, the FBI will still need to know that passcode, which Apple says could take over 4 years to guess if it's complex enough. And those are the likely reasons the FBI have now come to Apple demanding they hack the phone. Stay tuned.

Follow-up to a story from Wednesday: that Hollywood hospital that had been reduced to keeping records like it was 1952 has paid a ransom to the hackers that locked up its servers. A press release from Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center CEO Alan Stefanek said they paid 40 BitCoins -- or about $17,000 -- to get their computers back. He also said early reports the ransom was 9,000 bitcoins, or $3.4 million dollars, was false.

Stefanek said that paying the ransom was the ""quickest and most efficient way"" to get operations back online, which we think sets a bad precedent, but we also understand the urgency involved. Hackers have held other entities for ransom, including some small police departments, who typically paid less than one thousand dollars to get their data back. Still, this is a clear signal that data security should be a top priority.

"776","foxnews","2016-02-20 00:00:00","America, we could be looking at a Trump, Clinton contest","['Jessica Tarlov', 'Douglas E']","For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

Gratuitous. Nasty. Petty. Spiteful. Insulting. Just plain rude. When the rhetoric of a major partys leading presidential candidate falls to this level, we should be scornful.

So, how is it OK when it isnt just a presidential candidate, but a president, who does it?

Donald Trumps policy of demeaning and snarking his political opponents has been a favorite habit of President Obama for the last eight years. Obama is perhaps the first president who believes that leading the country and playing to the beliefs of the extremists in his own party amount to the same thing, and like Trump fans, Obama fans are motivated in large degree by sheer hatred.

They love to hear their idol channel their rage by bashing people they dont like.

Obamas latest, silent insult  leaving a spokesman to explain he had better things to do on a Saturday than attend the funeral of a 30-year justice of the Supreme Court  isnt surprising when you consider the mean-spirited things he says virtually every time he steps in front of a microphone.

This week Obama spokesman Josh Earnest bashed Sen. Chuck Schumer, who objected to cuts in counterterrorism funding for New York. Earnest said, in essence, why listen to this fool on anything if he opposed the Iran deal, especially since most Democrats were in favor?

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, accurately, that this was pure politics  the president was punishing New York to get back at Schumer.","[]"

Although the police department did not announce what is on the video, an ESPN source said it shows an encounter between Manziel, his ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley and a valet at the Hotel ZaZa in Dallas. According to an affidavit for a protection order, Crowley said that after arguing with Manziel in his hotel room, the Cleveland Browns quarterback led her down a back stairwell to the valet.

Crowley allegedly told the valet that she was ""scared for her life,"" but the valet said that he didn't know what to do. At which point, Manziel threw her into the passenger seat of the car and they drove away.

Crowley says that Manziel hit her and then threatened to commit suicide while they were en route to Fort Worth.

Police spokesman Maj. Midge Boyle said Saturday that investigators have reviewed medical records provided by Crowley and that they could conclude their domestic violence investigation by next week.

Manziel hasn't been charged, but a judge did issue Crowley a protection order against him.

Police haven't interviewed Manziel, but spoke to several other witnesses. Boyle says police want to have their strongest case against Manziel before speaking to him.

The debate over whether New Zealand should take Australia's unwanted asylum seekers comes amid an uproar over what will happen to 267 asylum seekers who are expected to be transferred from Australia to the Pacific atoll of Nauru. The issue of their fate was raised amid annual talks between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his visiting New Zealand counterpart John Key.

Australia refuses to allow any asylum seekers who try to reach the country's shores by boat to ever settle in Australia, and sends them instead to detention camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The policy has virtually stopped asylum seekers from the Middle East and Asia attempting to reach Australia on rickety boats.

The 267 asylum seekers came from Nauru's detention camp to Australia for medical treatment or to support a relative who needed treatment. They refused to return to Nauru pending an Australian High Court challenge to the legality of Australia's refugee policy, but the court recently ruled against them, leaving them at risk of deportation.

The court decision sparked outrage among refugee advocates, two of whom climbed to the top of a 160-meter (500-foot) tower in Melbourne on Friday to unfurl a banner with the Twitter hashtag LetThemStay.

Key's government reached an agreement in 2013 with Australia to resettle 150 refugees a year from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. On Friday, Key said the offer still stands, provided the asylum seekers meet New Zealand's character requirements and are genuine refugees.

""So I can't tell you who might or might not be able to come, or whether the Australian government would want to exercise the right to do that,"" Key told reporters in a joint press conference with Turnbull. ""All I can simply say is the offer remains on the table.""

But Turnbull appeared to dismiss the offer, saying the government didn't want to give people smugglers ""marketing opportunities"" to recruit asylum seekers to embark on the dangerous journey.

""We take into account what John has proposed ... but we do so very thoughtfully, recognizing that the one thing we must not do is give an inch to the people smugglers,"" Turnbull told reporters.","[]"
