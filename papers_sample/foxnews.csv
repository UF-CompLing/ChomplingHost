The spaceplane is designed to take a crew of two pilots and six passengers to space.

Virgin Galactic's spaceline fleet now consists of VSS Unity and two carrier aircraft - WhiteKnightTwo VMS Eve for transporting humans to space and the 747-400 Cosmic Girl for the company's LauncherOne satellite launch service.

The company will now perform systems verification on the new spaceplane, followed by ground and flight tests in Mojave and its future home in Spaceport America, N.M. In a press release, Virgin Galactic said that it has already started work on the next SpaceShipTwo.



VSS Unity replaces the first SpaceShipTwo, which broke apart on Oct. 31, 2014, during its fourth rocket-powered flight. Wreckage fell to the Mojave Desert.

The investigation into the mid-flight break up found that co-pilot Michael Alsbury prematurely unlocked the so-called feathering system that is intended to slow and stabilize the craft as it re-enters the atmosphere, according to the Associated Press. Alsbury was killed, but pilot Peter Siebold, although seriously injured, parachuted to safety.

foxnews,2014-05-05 00:00:00,Demystifying flying: What is an air pocket?,['Tom Bunn'],"If youve been a passenger in an airplane, its likely that you have felt an air pocket, or what feels like a quick drop in the air.

""Air pocket"" is merely another term for ordinary turbulence. You might feel as if you're falling from the sky, but rest assured, if you flying commercially, you rarely gain or lose more than about twenty feet, especially if the plane is on autopilot.

The term ""air pocket"" comes from early aviation, a time when pilots flying open-cockpit biplanes took adventurous locals on a rides in their flying machines. These planes, with two wings one above the other, flew at relatively slow speeds. When the plane entered air that, instead of simply sitting there, was flowing slightly upward or slightly downward, the plane's path was altered slightly upward or slightly downward. Air pockets do not technically exist, yet it's an expression that has caught on and is still misused today.

So what happens when you experience a bumpy ride that rattles glasses and turns some knuckles white?

The first thing you need to understand is a basic rule of flying: the earth has different surface temperatures that impacts flight as the aircraft passes through. For example, the surface of a lake is cooler than the surrounding earth, or plowed fields have a different surface temperature than those that are unplowed. Warm air is lighter than cool air. Warmed air rises. Cooled air descends. When a plane encounters varying airflow, we can feel what we call an air pocket today.

The idea of an ""air pocket"" might seem reassuring from a pilot's point of view, for a pocket is something you slip your hand into. When you do, your hand can only go so far. But, over the years, the phrase has come to be thought of as an area where there is no air. With no air, what is going to hold the plane up?

The term, if misunderstood, can lead to fear that an ""air pocket"" - a place devoid of air - could be big enough to cause a plane to plunge to the earth or go out of control. But it doesn't exist.

It may be helpful to try to imagine a ""water pocket,"" an area in a lake where there is no water. You can't, right? Since you can see water, it is hard to conceive of such a thing as a water pocket.

One analogy that is helpful to my clients is picturing the sky as one large bowl of Jello. Imagine that large bowl of chilled Jello with a small, plastic airplane in the middle. Now, pick up the bowl and shake it. The airplane certainly moves and jiggles, but it is impossible for the small plastic toy to fall out of the bowl (the sky).

Flying through an ""air pocket"" isn't much different from driving your car over a pot hole or steering a boat over waves. It may be bumpy, but you're rarely in danger --that is unless you're not wearing a seat belt.

Captain Tom Bunn, retired airline pilot and licensed therapist, is the founder of SOAR, a program designed to help those with fear of flying and flight-related anxieties.","['water', 'term', 'youre', 'slightly', 'flying', 'bowl', 'surface', 'air', 'pocket', 'plane', 'demystifying']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Bill Cosby's wife to give deposition in defamation case brought by seven accusers,[],"Bill Cosby's wife is slated to answer questions under oath in a defamation lawsuit brought against her husband by seven women who claim the comedian sexually assaulted them decades ago.

Camille Cosby is scheduled to be questioned by a lawyer for the women Monday at the Springfield Marriott. It is believed to be the first deposition Camille Cosby has given since dozens of women went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against her husband.

Lawyers for the Cosbys have argued that she does not have any information on the accuracy of the women's claims and that her conversations with her husband are confidential under the Massachusetts marital disqualification rule. They attempted to quash the deposition.

A judge had ruled Friday that Camille Cosby's deposition must proceed. However, defense lawyers filed an emergency motion late Saturday requesting it be delayed, saying the 71-year-old ""has had no involvement with the facts or allegations underlying this case."" They argued her public testimony would create ""an unnecessary media circus and personal security threat that serves no purpose other than to harass and embarrass her.""

In a ruling late Sunday, a judge said Monday's deposition can take place.

The Cosbys have a home in Shelburne Falls, about an hour's drive to Springfield, where the lawsuit was filed. The couple has been married for 52 years.

A lawyer for the women argued that because Camille Cosby has been the TV star's wife and business manager, she could have useful information.

The plaintiffs in the Massachusetts defamation case are among about 50 who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct.

In December, Cosby, 78, was charged in Pennsylvania with drugging and sexually assaulting a former Temple University employee at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. Cosby has pleaded not guilty. Earlier this month, a judge denied a motion by Cosby's lawyers to dismiss the charges. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 8.

Cosby's lawyers have said in court papers that the deposition is ""nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to pressure (the) defendant in the face of subjecting his wife to the shame and embarrassment of responding to questions about his alleged infidelities and sexual misconduct.""","['case', 'camille', 'seven', 'lawyers', 'cosby', 'wife', 'defamation', 'bill', 'brought', 'argued', 'deposition', 'judge', 'cosbys', 'sexual', 'accusers', 'women']"
foxnews,2016-02-01 00:00:00,Consumer Spending Unchanged in December,[],"U.S. consumer spending was unchanged in December as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and unseasonably mild weather weighed on demand for utilities, but a jump in savings to a three-year high suggested there is enough muscle to boost consumption in the months ahead.

Continue Reading Below

The Commerce Department said on Monday the unchanged reading in consumer spending followed an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in November. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent gain in November.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edging up 0.1 percent in December after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in November.

Consumer spending increased 3.4 percent in 2015 after advancing 4.2 percent in 2014.

That data was included in last Friday's fourth-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending slowed to a 2.2 percent annual rate from the third quarter's brisk 3 percent pace.

Moderate consumer spending, weak export growth and ongoing efforts by businesses to reduce unsold merchandise piled up in warehouses helped restrict economic growth to a 0.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter. More cutbacks in investment by energy firms struggling with lower oil prices also hurt GDP growth.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

In December, income rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in November. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in November. Income in 2015 increased

4.5 percent, the largest increase since 2012, after rising 4.4 percent in 2014.

With income outpacing spending, savings surged to $753.3 billion in December, the highest level since December 2012, from $717.8 billion in November.

Higher savings and rising house prices should help to soften the blow from a recent stock market sell-off and drive spending in early 2016.

With consumption soft, inflation retreated in December.

A price index for consumer spending slipped 0.1 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, however, rose 0.6 percent after increasing 0.4 percent in November.

That was the largest increase since December 2014.

Year-over-year inflation rates are rising as the weak readings during the year drop out of the calculation. Excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged after rising 0.2 percent in November. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in November.

Core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and remains well below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,HPV rate in teen girls drops by more than 60 percent,[],"The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections among teenage girls in the United States has dropped by more than 60 percent since the vaccine against the cancer-causing virus was introduced a decade ago, according to a new study.

The researchers found that, within six years of the vaccine's introduction in 2006, the prevalence of HPV among girls ages 14 to 19 decreased by 64 percent.

And, among young women ages 20 to 24, the prevalence decreased by 34 percent over that same time period, the researchers found.

The new results suggest that the HPV vaccine ""is a very effective vaccine,"" said lead study author Dr. Lauri E. Markowitz, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In the study, the researchers pulled data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is a yearly survey of people in the U.S. that involves both interviews and physical exams. The researchers looked at data on the percentage of teenage girls and young women who were infected with HPV between 2003 and 2006  shortly before the vaccine was introduced in 2006  and then again between 2009 and 2012  several years after it was introduced.

Among girls ages 14 to 19, the researchers found, 11.5 percent were infected with HPV before the vaccine was introduced in 2006. That percentage dropped to 4.3 percent for the years between 2009 and 2012, the researchers found. [5 Dangerous Vaccine Myths]

Among women ages 20 to 24, the prevalence dropped from 18.5 percent before the vaccine was introduced to 12.1 percent in the years after it was introduced.

Three types of HPV vaccine have been available since the introduction of the vaccine in 2006, and clinical trials have shown that all three work well for preventing HPV infections, the researchers said. One of the vaccines, the bivalent one, targets two strains of the HPV virus. Another vaccine, called quadrivalent, targets four strains. The newest vaccine, 9-valent HPV vaccine, which was licensed in 2014, targets the same four strains of the virus as the quadrivalent vaccine plus an additional five HPV strains.

However, during the they years covered in the study, and until 2014, nearly everyone who received an HPV vaccination in the United States was given the quadrivalent vaccine, the researchers said.

The new results are in line in with previous research conducted by the CDC that also showed that the prevalence of HPV infections among 14 to 19 year-old girls had decreased after the introduction of the vaccine, the researchers said. Now, the new study adds the first evidence that also shows the impact of the vaccine on the prevalence of HPV in young women in their 20s, they said.

The CDC currently recommends the HPV vaccine for girls and boys at 11 or 12 years of age, administered in three doses over six months.

Through the new results are encouraging, the number of young people who have received the vaccine has increased more slowly than the researchers had expected, the researchers said. According to separate data gathered in the CDC in recent years, only 42 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 have received all three recommended doses of the vaccine.

The new study was published today (Feb. 22) in the journal Pediatrics.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Common software would have allowed FBI to unlock San Bernardino shooter's phone,[],"The county government that owned the iPhone in a high-profile legal battle between Apple Inc. and the Justice Department paid for but never installed a feature that would have allowed the FBI to easily and immediately unlock the phone as part of the terrorism investigation into the shootings that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.



If the technology, known as mobile device management, had been installed, San Bernardino officials would have been able to remotely unlock the iPhone for the FBI without the theatrics of a court battle that is now pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns.



The service costs $4 per month per phone.



Instead, the only person who knew the unlocking passcode for the phone is the dead gunman, Syed Farook, who worked as an inspector in the county's public health department.



The iPhone assigned to Farook also lacked a Touch ID feature, meaning the FBI cannot use the dead gunman's thumbprint to unlock it now. The FBI found the phone in a car after the shootings.



A U.S. magistrate last week ordered Apple to provide the FBI with highly specialized software that could be loaded onto the work-issued iPhone 5C used by Farook. He died with his wife in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in December.



The software would help the FBI hack into the phone by bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.



The FBI said it wants to determine whether Farook had used his phone to communicate with others about the attack.



FBI Director James Comey said the agency owes it to the victims of the San Bernardino terror attacks to try to gain access to a cellphone used by one of the gunmen.



In a message posted Sunday night on the Lawfare blog, Comey said the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead."" Comey said the court case ""isn't about trying to set a precedent"" but is instead about doing justice for the victims.



Apple has said it will protest the ruling and has until Friday to intervene in court.



San Bernardino had an existing contract with a technology provider, MobileIron Inc., but did not install it on any inspectors' iPhones, county spokesman David Wert said. There is no countywide policy on the matter and departments make their own decisions, he said.



MobileIron has confirmed that if the software were installed on the iPhone, it would unlock it.



Wert disputed the value of the remote management technology because he said Farook -- or any other county employee -- could have removed it manually. That would have alerted county technology employees and led them to intervene.



In many offices and classrooms, officially issued smartphones include the installed management software. It can unlock the phone, delete all information in case of loss or theft, track the device's physical location, determine which apps are installed, check battery life and push software updates. The technology is intended to make such products more suitable in corporate environments, where tighter controls are important to protect company secrets.



""This is the business case"" for mobile device management, said John Dickson, a principal at Denim Group Ltd., a security consultancy. ""The organization simply has no control or influence or anything over the device unless they have some MDM authority. The ability to do remote air updates, the ability to do remote wipe, the ability to control certain settings. Those are the standard kinds of things you do in mobile device management.""



Dickson said ""the big question now going forward, it builds the case for, is why this guy would have an essentially uncontrolled device.""



This is the first time since the county issued its first Blackberry device in 2003 that law enforcement has needed access to a locked county-owned phone, Wert said. Prosecutors said in court filings that the county gave its consent to search the device. County policy said digital devices can be searched at any time and Farook signed such an agreement.

Apple executives said Friday that the company had worked hard to help federal investigators get information off the locked iPhone, suggesting they use an iCloud workaround while the phone was connected to a familiar wireless network so that it would begin automatically backing up and provide access to data. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing legal process.



The executives said Apple sent engineers to work with the FBI on the workaround but the effort ultimately failed. The FBI said it worked with the county to reset the iCloud password a few days after the attack to try to get immediate access to the data. That effort eliminated the possibility of the Apple suggested workaround being possible.



But if the county had installed the management device it had bought onto Farook's phone, none of these efforts would have been necessary.



Ted Olson, a lawyer for Apple, told ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday that the legal fight had evoked an important debate about privacy and civil liberties. But he warned there'd be no limiting what the government could require Apple to do in the future if the Justice Department got its way this time.



""Apple has a responsibility to maintain the trust and faith of millions of people who've depended upon Apple to produce a product that protects their privacy -- their intimate, personal life,"" said Olson, a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ""This is a Pandora's box.""



Gartner Inc., a technology research firm, estimated that over 60 percent of large enterprises -- meaning business, government and educational entities -- used some kind of MDM software as of last year, though not necessarily on all company-owned devices. That percentage is likely higher now than when the research was done months ago, said Terrence Cosgrove, a research director with Gartner's mobile and client computing research group. Cosgrove said MDM adoption rates are generally higher among government users.



Many workers balk at the idea that the software can monitor and track their personal phones, said Alex Heid, chief research officer at the cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard Inc. But if the company provides a phone, it's considered reasonable practice to use such software.



""If a company's assumption is that they might not be able to get back into a device one day then it's not really a company asset at that point, it's a gift,"" he said.","['farook', 'apple', 'san', 'bernardino', 'installed', 'county', 'phone', 'unlock', 'iphone', 'common', 'allowed', 'device', 'fbi', 'software', 'technology', 'shooters']"

The exit survey, released four hours after the close of the polls, performed by Equipos Mori revealed that ""No"" votes outweighed ""Yes"" votes by 51 percent to 49 percent while the survey by Ipsos found the ""No""-""Yes"" breakdown to be 52.3 to 47.7 percent.

More than 6.5 million Bolivians were called to vote in the referendum on whether to reform the Constitution to allow presidents to serve three consecutive terms, in contrast to the current limit of two consecutive terms.

Broadening the number of consecutive terms in office would allow Morales to - once again - run for reelection.

Both surveys found that the ""Yes"" option won only in the provinces of La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro, while the ""No"" option won in Santa Cruz, Potosi, Chuquisaca, Tarija, Beni and Pando.

The ""No"" option won by more than 60 percent in Tarija, Beni, Potosi and Santa Cruz, according to the surveys.

Recent voter surveys - conducted prior to the referendum - had shown that the ""Yes"" and ""No"" options were running neck and neck, but they were released before a controversial complaint became public implicating Morales in an alleged case of influence peddling involving a former girlfriend, a charge the president has denied.

Days before North Koreas latest nuclear-bomb test, the Obama administration secretly agreed to talks to try to formally end the Korean War, dropping a longstanding condition that Pyongyang first take steps to curtail its nuclear arsenal.

Instead the U.S. called for North Koreas atomic-weapons program to be simply part of the talks. Pyongyang declined the counter-proposal, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. Its nuclear test on Jan. 6 ended the diplomatic gambit.

The episode, in an exchange at the United Nations, was one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obamas second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.

""Working with Bunuel was wonderful. It was the pinnacle of my career in the cinema,"" the 84-year-old actress, who spoke with the media about ""Esta soy yo"" (This Is Me) at the Palacio de Mineria International Book Fair, told EFE on Friday.

Pinal, a native of the northwestern state of Sonora, said the peak of her career was when ""Viridiana"" was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival.

In her personal life she said one of her greatest experiences was the birth of her daughter Sylvia Pasquel in 1949, while in politics she mentioned being sworn in as a federal senator in 1997.

The 384-page autobiography examines all aspects of her life, although she devotes most of her attention to her acting career and explains why she never succumbed to the siren's call of Hollywood.

""I was already beginning to work in the theater, acting in the play 'Ring, ring, llama el amor' (Bells are Ringing, 1958) - the first musical comedy produced in Mexico - with considerable success,"" Pinal recalled.

She added that the agent of Judy Holliday, who had starred in that musical on Broadway, ""came to see me in Mexico City and after seeing the performance he asked me if I wanted to go to Los Angeles.""

Pinal said the decision was an easy one.

""I already had a name in Mexico. I was acting, doing theater and movies. It was a good opportunity, but the truth is I didn't want to go; I was really enjoying myself and I'm still enjoying myself.

For Jeb Bushs campaign, August was a cruel month. Donald Trumps attacks on the former Florida governor as a low-energy politician were beginning to stick, and the two were bickering over immigration. The issue before the Bush team was what to do about it.

Some advisers argued for an aggressive response, even to the point of challenging Trump to some kind of one-on-one confrontation. Others resisted, believing Trumps candidacy was unsustainable, while some cautioned against getting into a pigpen with a pig, as one adviser recalled. Others described it as trying to wrestle with a stump.

Critics took to Twitter to question the 30-year-old model's parenting choices after Teigen mentioned her plan to hire a night nurse after her baby daughter is born to US Weekly.

Not everyone was supportive of the idea, and many took to Twitter -- where the ""Lip Sync Battle"" co-host is active -- to let her know.

""'Night nurse' for your baby's feedings and diaper changes. How awful Take care of your baby. [sic] You'll never get that time back. @chrissyteigen,"" one user tweeted.

Teigen, 30, tweeted to clarify the role the night nurse will play.

""A night nurse doesn't replace you waking and feeding at night. You're up with them. They're helpers and teachers,"" she wrote.

She went on to express disappointment at the parenting criticism.

""I am so used to sharing our life that I forget how protective I will be soon. I cannot handle this kind of constant judgement!"" she tweeted.

Krause showed off some impressive striking and ground-work through the first two rounds, but his constant effort to drag the fight to the mat nearly backfired late.

A back and forth first round saw both men get the advantage during separate exchanges on the feet. Krause looked strong early as he stuck his straight punches in Campbell's face for the first few minutes.

Campbell fired back late with a couple of combinations that found a home but Krause came storming back with a takedown and a near rear naked choke that might have finished the fight if not for the end of the round.

After nearly putting Campbell away, Krause looked to duplicate his performance while getting the fight back to the mat and looking for the choke yet again.

It appeared Krause had the choke in deep, but Campbell continued to scramble until he got free and eventually worked his way back to the feet while also landing a nasty knee to the chest as the fighters got up off the canvas.

Krause relentlessly pursued the takedown in the third and final round and while Campbell was able to withstand the pressure, he didn't do much to fire back with his own offense.

The constant attacks took the wind out of Krause and Campbell finally took advantage with a perfectly timed inside trip that put him on the mat and in control. Unfortunately, Campbell was unable to take full advantage to put Krause away although he landed some damaging shots just before the final horn.

The judges all saw the fight the same way -- 29-28 in favor of Krause, who gets his second win n a row although he wasn't all that excited about his performance.

""I'm not happy with it at all, I'll be honest with you guys,"" Krause said. ""I want a finish.""

Happy or not, Krause gets consecutive wins for the first time since joining the UFC roster after a few ups and downs to begin his career inside the Octagon.","['survives', 'mat', 'advantage', 'shane', 'james', 'away', 'choke', 'krause', 'late', 'fight', 'win', 'campbell', 'surge', 'round', 'nearly']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The media's firewall against Donald Trump: The voters must be dummies or racists,['Howard Kurtz'],"Just when it seemed the media were starting to accept Donald Trumps front-runner status after South Carolina, we had a newspaper throwing a temper tantrum.

New Yorks Daily News, ticked off at the outcome, blamed the voters with this front-page screamer: CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.

In other words, TABLOID TO VOTERS: YOURE ALL LOSERS.

And the lead of the story was just as insulting: The piggish voters of South Carolina gobbled up the slop that Donald Trump served up Saturday  handing the bloodthirsty billionaire his second straight Republican presidential primary win.

I know the News, which is becoming a sad parody, despises Trump, having depicted him as a clown and, during his dustup with the Pope, the ANTICHRIST.

But that doesnt seem much different than the Huffington Post reacting to Donald Trumps first primary victory with a red-letter headline: NH GOES RACIST SEXIST XENOPHOBIC.

And it illustrates how, when it comes to Trump, some in the media are moving from denial to anger.

I wonder if a New York Times piece on the eve of the South Carolina primary is a more polite and sophisticated way of getting at the same pointthat the voters are to blame for making a lousy decision.

The Times has on-the-record quotes to back up its story line, but the underlying assumption is that Trump is just bad news:

Republicans in South Carolina have in recent years raced ahead of the national party in presenting an inclusive face to voters.

But in the face of this admirable progress comes a likely Trump victory: For party leaders and mainstream voters here, it may come as a kind of deflating climax...

His results in the two early-voting states so far have alarmed more traditional Republicans, who fear that a Trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of Republicans as an angry and intolerant party...

The fear among Republican leaders here is that a smashing victory for Mr. Trump would say more about the party, and about the state, potentially undermining South Carolinas image as a more welcoming place that is no longer defined by figures like Strom Thurmond.

Got it? The Palmetto State is now a welcoming place, but for Trump to win the primary would make South Carolina look like it was back in Thurmonds segregationist era.

As Trump has continued to gain strength, hes attracting a different kind of bad press, which tries to blame othersthe culture, the media, the Republican Partyfor what these critics see as the awful phenomenon that is The Donald.

Slate, in the process of slamming MSNBCs town hall with Trump, complains that the medias coverage of Trump has been soft, insufficient, and without substance because it has failed to deal with months of bigoted comments and almost pathological dishonesty.

Its that the medias relationship with Trump should worry Hillary Clinton, assuming each of them vanquishes their primary opponents. I would have said six months ago, perhaps naively, that a blatantly bigoted candidate would face such a sustained media firestorm (especially in liberal precincts) that he would be incapable of getting elected. Thats not yet the case. Indeed, there are no signs that the medias sick, interminable honeymoon with Trump will come to an end anytime soon.

Think about that. Trump is a bigoted and pathological liar, so any coverage that doesnt portray him that way, or confront him with his many sins, is embarrassingly anemic.

National Review Editor Rich Lowry, a fierce Trump critic, says in Politico that Trump is defining decorum down:

Weve grown used to how Trump has treated Jeb Bush in the debates, but that doesnt make it any less appalling a breach of political norms or basic decency.

The faces he makes while Bush talks, the constant interrupting, the petty put-downs  all of this would have been thought unworthy of the lowest political guttersnipe but have become an accepted part of the landscape thanks to Donald J. Trump...

The key to Trumps strength, which buttresses all his outrageousness, is that his supporters want someone to blow up the system. So there's almost nothing he can say or do that will discredit him in their eyes, and the least destructive scenario for his defeat  Trump blows himself up  will take some doing on his part.

Its all very entertaining  but so are demolition derbies.

Now theres an eye-catching metaphor.

National Reviews David French says both Trump and Bernie Sanders have risen from the wreckage of a broken culture:

The conservative culture we do have is still a celebrity culture, and Donald Trump has taken it by storm.

The secret of his continued dominance is that he does anger bigger and better than anyone else, and his fans are willing to forgive or even cheer any transgression against conservative principle or simple good taste as a result. All manner of cruelty and lies can be justified by fury at the Left, by rage at the GOPe, or by the cry of the other side does it.

Conservative leaders who were used to being the angriest and least politically correct people in the room now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of saying no  of saying that some things shouldnt be said and some ideas are genuinely offensive.

Back to the left, Salon paints Trump as a Frankenstein created by a pathetic GOP:

What makes Trump unique isnt his shameless sophistry or his crass rhetoric; he simply does what most politicians  especially on the right  have always done, only better and without limits. He knows his supporters  a majority of whom are old and white  dont care about policies (many of them have been voting against their own interests for years anyway), and so he goes straight to their sense of identity. Of course he cant make Mexico pay for a wall, but promising to do so assuages their fears of a country in which white people will, eventually, be a minority. If they cared about their jobs, that rage would be directed at the corporations that shipped them overseas, not the brown people coming here to park cars and pick fruit...

The GOP now consists mostly of old and angry white people who are rejecting a world they dont like or understand. The nativism and hysteria animating Trumps campaign has been at the center of Republican politics for a long time  Trump is simply capitalizing on it.

Old angry white guys, blatant bigotry, confederacy of dunces. Not much attempt here to discern why Trump has won the first two primary statesand giving him more ammunition that the press treats him unfairly.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"Trump big winner, Clinton still on shaky ground",['William Whalen'],"How is it possible to have presidential contests in Nevada and South Carolina that are both appealing and appalling to conservatives?

Lets review Saturdays results.

In Nevadas Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didnt connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity.

Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign cant wait to bid adieu to a February in which the candidate hasnt run so much as shes lurched.

Pre-Nevada, Hillarys national lead over Sanders evaporated. Showing none of the certainty of a repeat presidential candidate, Clinton has fiddled with her core message (Im a progressive who likes to get things done) with the same frequency that she changed hairstyles back in the 1990s.

The bottom line: despite winning Nevada, Clintons long-term prospects remain shaky.

And that should elate conservatives.

Now, for the appalling: a Republican primary in South Carolina that had little do with conservative principles, ideas or values.

The complaint here isnt that Donald Trump won. Or, that his dominance again defies common sense: only a single-digit number of South Carolinians told exit pollsters that Trump shares their values; the twice-divorced candidate split the evangelical vote with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

The concern: the nature of how Trump goes about his business  the king of noisy bandwidth, his bombast and calculated fights for months now have dominated news cycles, streamed ceaselessly on social media, and stifled any chance at a calm, rational, issues-driven conversation on the Republican slide.

South Carolina was yet another casualty. The primary was an opportunity to discuss what exactly the conservative movement embodies these days. Now, the moments passed.

To the need to broadening the partys appeal to win national elections, there was a chance to showcase Gov. Nikki Haley (the nations only female Indian-American head of state) and Sen. Tim Scott (one of only two African-American senators).

Both supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dominated the exit-poll electability question. Both played cameos roles compared to the candidates infighting.

South Carolina leads the nation in direct foreign investment and has a veteran population 25 percent larger than the national average. Last year, the state dealt gracefully with three divisive issues: lowering the Confederate flag at the state Capitol; a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston that led to an outpouring of calm, not violence; the fatal police shooting of black man in North Charleston that likewise didnt turn into urban riots.

So where was the conversation regarding growing the economy, the perils of union over-reach (West Virginia, like South Carolina, becoming a right-to-work state this past week), a more coherent foreign policy and a more united society across racial and ideological lines?

The answer: they all were smothered by Trumps antics  and a malady best described as Candidate Derangement Syndrome.

During the course of the GOPs 10-day road trip down south, Trump threatened to sue Cruz over an ad claiming the GOP frontrunner once supported abortion rights. Trump went mano-a-mitre with Pope Francis over building a border wall. He blamed George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks, insinuating that the former president lied his way into the Iraq invasion. Trump even called for a boycott of Apple products so long as the computer refuses to hack into a dead terrorists iPhone.

The media ate it up.

Not surprisingly, the primary played into the stereotype of South Carolina as a political circus.

In fairness, Trumps not the only offender here. Cruz and Rubio spit-balled each other over character flaws, policy inconsistencies and sloppy photo-shopping. Jeb Bush went after Trump in defense of his big brother and in vain hopes of jump-starting a campaign that ended not long after the polls closed.

The question moving forward for conservatives: is this the way its going to be until someone earns 1,237 delegates and the partys nomination?

With three primaries down and another 17 Republican contests to be held over the course of the next two weeks, look for the following dominos to tumble.

Bush. Theres a saying in Silicon Valley: WFIO. It stands for Were F---ed, Its Over.

Credit Jeb Bush with recognizing in an instant that his campaign was over. His concession speech was dignified and without a trace of bitterness  rarities in this age of harsh politics. Other candidates whod spend nearly $81 million in ads ($15 million in South Carolina) with only four delegates to show night not have been so graceful.

Now, the political question: how quickly does Bush throw his organizational and financial weight behind Rubio? Its a good question, as relations between the Floridians are strained, but nowhere near Bushs animosity for Trump.

Rubio. As was the case after his third-place finish in Iowa, opportunity knocks. So how does Rubio capitalize on newfound moment? Look for an infusion of cash and a spate of endorsements. Rubios priorities in the weeks ahead: amassing delegates on March 1 (much easier now that Bush is out of the race), winning Florida on March 15.

Meanwhile, circle this date: Feb. 25. Its the next GOP candidates debate  University of Houston, CNN and Telemundo moderating. And its Rubios next chance to shine as the establishments alternative to Trump and Cruz.

Cruz. Six March 1 states line up as targets for Cruz  Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and his home state of Texas. For Cruz, the goal is to stay close to Trump by winning as many delegates as possible in these winner-takes-most states that allot the delegates proportionally.

The key figure for Cruz and Rubio, presuming Trump continues to run in the low- to mid-30s: 20 percent, which is the threshold required in most states in order to earn delegates.

Trump. Yes, he won. Decisively so.

But as the attention focuses on three candidates, does Trumps share of the pie expand? Trumps support so far: 24.3 percent in Iowa; 35.3 percent in New Hampshire; 33 percent in South Carolina.

For those who see Trump as a media-savvier version of Pat Buchanans insurrection back in 1992, this reminder: Buchanan peaked at 37.5 percent in New Hampshire; he then had trouble cracking 30 percent. The protest movement had a ceiling.

Unlike Buchanans run, Trump is actually winning states. Whether he can get to 40 percent and beyond: its the difference between a race that could be over by Easter Sunday or an unsettled national convention in July.

With the Republican race staying in the South through March 1, perhaps its best to remember a NASCAR adage about the pushing and shoving and fender-bending that occurs along the speedway: rubbings racing.

Thats true in this Republican field, even if the process rubs conservatives the wrong way.

Without our help, the true genius of Kanye West cant be realized

Kanye West fans are coming to the rescue. One benevolent soul is vowing to help the rapper pay off his $53 million debt by launching a GoFundMe page.

Jeremey Piatt set up the page on Feb. 15, and at press time 432 fans have chipped in $4,157 towards the cause. West publicly asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for financial assistance on his Twitter page, with seemingly no success.

Piatt clarified that he isnt looking to earn a penny from the endeavor, and requested that GoFundMe transfer all the funds over to Wests handlers.

Kanye West, prolific entertainer/fashion icon/celebrity/member of the Kardashian family needs our help, he wrote on the page. Recently, Kanye let us in on his personal struggle. He is 53 million dollars in debt and it doesnt look like hes going to get Mark Zuckerbergs help that he desperately needs.

Piatt encouraged fans to open their hearts and wallets for Kanye today.

Sure he is personally rich and can buy furs and houses for his family, but without our help, the true genius of Kanye West cant be realized, he said.

Mark Zuckerberg has yet to issue a formal response to Kanye Wests billion-dollar request, but he has definitely liked it. The Facebook CEO hit the thumbs-up button on a status posted by user Steven Grimm that read, Dear Kanye West: If youre going to ask the CEO of Facebook for a billion dollars, maybe dont do it on Twitter.

I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house ... World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me... Im this generations Disney... I want to bring dope sh*t to the world... I dont have enough resources to create what I really can...

This new species, the first ever found in the eastern United States, was probably 20 to 30 feet long as an adult and lived during the late Cretaceous Period, roughly 83 million years ago. It mostly walked on its hind legs, though it could come down on all four to graze on plants with teeth that are similar to modern day horses and cows. It had a scaly exterior and a large crest on its nose.

This is a really important animal in telling us how they came to be and how they spread all over the world, said Florida State University Professor of Biological Science Gregory Erickson, one of the authors of a paper detailing the dinosaur in the findings the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The researchers named the new dinosaur Eotrachodon orientalis, which means dawn rough tooth from the east. The name pays homage to Trachodon, which was the first duck-billed dinosaur named in 1856.

The skeletal remains - a complete skull, dozens of backbones, a partial hip bone and a few bones from the limbs - were originally found by a team of amateur fossil enthusiasts alongside a creek in Montgomery County, Alabama in marine sediment. That would suggest the dinosaur likely was washed out to sea by river or stream sediments after it died.

When the group realized they had potentially discovered something of scientific importance, they contacted McWane Science Center in Birmingham, which dispatched a team to the site to carefully remove the remains from the surrounding rock.

During the late Cretaceous Period, North America was divided in half by a 1,000 mile ocean that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. This body of water created two North American landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east.

For roughly 100 million years, the dinosaurs were not able to cross this barrier, Jun Ebersole, director of collections at McWane Science Center, said. The discovery of Eotrachodonsuggests that duck-billed dinosaurs originated in Appalachia and dispersed to other parts of the world at some point after the seaway lowered, opening a land corridor to western North America.

They just needed to get off the island, he continued. From there, they became the cows of the Cretaceous.

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector that transmits the Zika virus, and also dengue and chikunguna.

(AP Photo/Ricardo Mazalan, File)

Top House Republicans said Thursday that the fastest way for President to obtain money to combat the spread of the Zika virus is to tap leftover funding from the 2014 battle against Ebola.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers and other senior panel members told the White House budget chief Shaun Donovan that there's plenty of unspent anti-Ebola funding to cover the $1.8 billion Obama seeks to fight Zika. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said earlier this month that the administration wants to retain Ebola funds to ""finish the job in terms of Ebola.""

The letter from Appropriations Chairman Rogers identified $2.7 billion in ""unobligated"" Ebola funds at HHS, the State Department and in foreign aid accounts.

""If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible, it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola response, prevention, and preparedness,"" Rogers wrote. ""These funds can and should be prioritized to meet the most pressing needs of mounting a rapid and full response to Zika.""

Rogers added that he would consider replacing the Ebola money that would be tapped to fight Zika if circumstances warrant.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said earlier this month that any Zika money should be ""offset"" with cuts elsewhere. The Ebola money at issue was deemed emergency funding and was not provided on the basis that it be paid for by other budget cuts.

Voters' fears regarding Ebola were seen as hurting Obama's party in the 2014 midterm landslide.

The Zika virus is feared to cause severe birth defects in unborn children and is spreading through Brazil and other countries in the Americas. There has been no transmission of the virus by mosquitoes within the U.S., but travelers have returned with the infection.","['urge', 'funding', 'rogers', 'unobligated', 'money', 'funds', 'republicans', 'fight', 'virus', 'way', 'house', 'ebola', 'zika', 'response', 'obama']"

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,"Clinton email chain discussed Afghan national's CIA ties, official says","['Pamela K', 'Catherine Herridge']","EXCLUSIVE: One of the classified email chains discovered on Hillary Clintons personal unsecured server discussed an Afghan nationals ties to the CIA and a report that he was on the agencys payroll, a U.S. government official with knowledge of the document told Fox News.

The discussion of a foreign national working with the U.S. government raises security implications  an executive order signed by President Obama said such unauthorized disclosures are presumed to cause damage to the national security.""

The U.S. government official said the Clinton email exchange, which referred to a New York Times report, was among 29 classified emails recently provided to congressional committees with specific clearances to review them. In that batch were 22 top secret exchanges deemed too damaging to national security to release.

Confirmation that one of these exchanges concerned a reported CIA asset means the emails went beyond issues like the drone strike campaign. Democrats repeatedly have said some messages referred to this, reinforcing Clinton's position that the documents are over-classified.

Based on the timing and other details, the email chain likely refers to either an October 2009 Times story that identified Afghan national Ahmed Wali Karzai, the half-brother of then-Afghan president Hamid Karzai, as a person who received regular payments from the Central Intelligence Agency -- or an August 2010 Times story that identified Karzai aide Mohammed Zia Salehi as being on the CIA payroll. Ahmed Wali Karzai was murdered during a 2011 shoot-out, a killing later claimed by the Taliban.

Fox News was told the email chain included then-Secretary of State Clinton and then-special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke and possibly others. The basic details of this email exchange were backed up to Fox News by a separate U.S. government source who was not authorized to speak on the record.

Its unclear who initiated the discussion  Clinton, Holbrooke or a subordinate  or whether the CIA's relationship with the Afghan national was confirmed, because the classified documents are not public.

Holbrooke died in December 2010, during his service as a special envoy.

A CIA spokesperson told Fox News they had no comment on the email chain.

A spokeswoman for the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General also had no comment.

The U.S. government official's account of the Clinton email chain dovetails with a Feb. 3 interview on Fox News America's Newsroom, where Republican Rep. Chris Stewart, a member of the House intelligence committee, said, ""I have never read anything more sensitive than what these emails contain. They do reveal classified methods. They do reveal classified sources and they do reveal human assets.""

Stewart added, ""I can't imagine how anyone could be familiar with these emails, whether they're sending them or receiving them, and not realize that these are highly classified.""

While the Clinton campaign claims the government classification review has gone too far, Executive Order 13526, in a section called ""classification standards, says, ""the unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.""

Fox News was first to report that the Clinton emails contained intelligence beyond top secret, and some of the information was deemed ""HCS-O""  a code that refers to human intelligence from ongoing operations.

National security and intelligence experts emphasized to Fox News that security clearance holders are trained to not confirm or deny details of a classified program in an unclassified setting, which would include a personal unsecured email network, even if the classified program appears in press reports.

The rules of handling classified information dictate if something is reported in open source [news reports] you dont confirm it because its still classified information, said Dan Maguire, who spent more than four decades handling highly classified programs and specialized in human intelligence operations.

As secretary of state, Clinton signed at least two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) on Jan. 22, 2009, and received a briefing from a security officer whose identity was redacted. As part of the NDA for sensitive compartmented information (SCI), Clinton acknowledged any breach could result in termination of my access to SCI and removal from a position of special confidence and trust requiring such access as well as the termination of my employment or any other relationships with any Department or Agency that provides me with access to SCI.""

It is remains unclear how classified materials jumped the gap from a classified system to her personal server.

On Feb. 12, Clintons national press secretary Brian Fallon emphasized that classified information would have been marked as such. I think when this review plays itself out, at the end theyll find that what we have said is true, he told CNN. Nothing was marked classified at the time it was sent.

Fallon also attacked the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, for what he described as fishing expedition-style investigations since Clinton decided to run for president. There is no basis. It is intended to create headwinds for her campaign, but it is not going to work, Fallon said. He leveled a similar allegation against Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough, III, after his office notified Congress the emails contained information beyond top secret.

Inquiries by Fox News to Clinton's attorney David Kendall about the status of or changes to her security clearance, and access to classified information, have not been returned.

Jeff Brashares, 61, of Marysville, Ohio, is that person. Once a year he participates in CoasterMania, an event at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, where theme-park fanatics ride roller coasters from 6 a.m. until after midnight.

So it come as no surprise that his wife, Angie, calls him a coaster-crazy. After all, hes a member of the American Coaster Enthusiasts, and hes been chasing down thrill rides for the past 56 years. Just two years ago, he even convinced his wife to get married at a theme park and ride a coaster immediately after -- tux, wedding gown and all.

This summer, with an extended family in tow, he will be on the road checking out some new rides, including Banshee, a roller coaster at Kings Island in Ohio, and Wonder Mountains Guardian, an interactive 4-D ride at Wonderland in Canada.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,3 reasons the Cardinals can hold off the Cubs in the NL Central,[],"Each weekday between now and the end of spring training, we'll analyze one team's keys for success (or keys to avoid complete irrelevance) in the 2016 season. We turn our attention to the NL Central this week and begin by analyzing why a fourth consecutive division title is realistic for the Cardinals.

1. Their rotation is stronger than people think. First, the bad news. The loss of John Lackey, who led the rotation with 218 innings pitched last season, hurts. But was it realistic to expect him to duplicate his career-best numbers at age 37 this season? There also is a void left by Lance Lynn, who will miss the 2016 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. And depth will be an issue with top prospect Alex Reyes serving a 50-game suspension.

However, ace Adam Wainwright is healthy after missing most of the 2015 season, Michael Wacha is coming off a 17-win season, Mike Leake is a perfect free-agent fit and Carlos Martinez is back after missing the postseason with a shoulder injury. As always, Jaime Garcia is a wild card because of his health, but he was excellent (2.43 ERA, 1.05 WHIP) in 20 starts last season.

2. They aren't the senior citizens Jason Heyward thinks they are. Heyward rankled Cardinals Nation by saying one of the reasons he signed with the Cubs this offseason was because of their young core, implying that the Cardinals watch ""Matlock"" reruns in the clubhouse before napping in recliners each afternoon.

Sure, St. Louis has some aging veterans (Matt Holliday, Jhonny Peralta, Yadier Molina, Wainwright), but it also is loaded with talented youngsters. Second baseman Kolten Wong (age 25), center fielder Randal Grichuk (24) and right fielder Stephen Piscotty (25) all made major impacts last season. Ditto for Wacha (24), Martinez (24) and closer Trevor Rosenthal (25). And there's more young talent on the farm.

3. Matt Carpenter has outgrown the leadoff spot. In fact, Carpenter outhomered and outslugged every Cubs player except Anthony Rizzo last season. That should earn the third baseman a spot in the middle of the Cardinals' order after he hit .300 as the team's leadoff man the past three-plus seasons.

Often overshadowed even on his own team, Carpenter is a legitimate MVP candidate who ranks 12th in the majors in on-base percentage over the past three seasons. In that three-season span, he has led the NL in runs, hits, doubles and walks at least once.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"'You're not the shooter, are you?' Witnesses describe rides with accused Michigan gunman",[],"Multiple witnesses have come forward to describe harrowing car trips Saturday night with Jason Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people and critically injuring two others during a six-hour shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Mich.

The witnesses' testimony indicates that Dalton was picking up fares in between carrying out the apparently random shootings. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Sunday that Dalton was a driver for the ride-sharing service, but did not say whether he was working Saturday night.

Matt Mellen told WWMT that he called police to report Dalton for erratic driving more than an hour before the accused shooter began firing on his targets.

Mellen said Dalton picked him up around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday and began driving very erratically after he got a phone call and hung up. He said Dalton was speeding, sideswiping cars and driving over medians and lawns. Mellen said when the vehicle came to a stop, he ran from the car and called police and also reported Dalton to Uber.

Authorities allege that Dalton shot the first victim outside of an apartment complex a little more than an hour later.

MLive reported that a Facebook post from a woman named Mackenzie Waite described an Uber driver named Jason as ""not a safe ride"". Waite, who said in the post that her fiance had booked a ride with Dalton, claimed that Dalton sideswiped a car while running a stop sign and then drove 80 miles per hour down a local street ""swerving in and out of oncoming traffic"".

Waite's post was timestampted at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, about 30 minutes before the first shooting took place. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting confirmed to MLive that law enforcement knew about the post.

Fox17 reported that a local couple, Jamie and Kacey Black saw a man jump out of a vehicle they recognized later as Dalton's. The man told them the driver had been driving erratically and would not let him out. It was not immediately clear whether the man was Waite's fiance or Mellen.

Kacey Black said she called 911 to report the driver, but said ""I felt like they didn't believe me. They just kind of laughed at me.""

At 6 p.m., a woman was shot multiple times outside an apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County. She was expected to survive.

At around 7 p.m., Dalton's next door neighbor James Block told the Associated Press that his niece saw Dalton drive out his driveway. When he got to the street, he stopped and rapidly backed toward his garage, turning his vehicle so the lights shined toward Block's house, Block said. Then he drove off.

""He was there between the shootings,"" Block said.

A Kalamazoo man with the Twitter handle IamKeithBlack posted Sunday that Dalton had given him a ride at around 8 p.m. A receipt he posted indicated that Dalton had driven him 4.8 miles and the ride had lasted 10 minutes.

About four hours after the initial shooting and 15 miles away, a man and his son were shot to death while looking at vehicles at Seelye Kia of Kalamazoo.

Then, 15 minutes later, gunfire erupted outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Four women, including retired school teacher Mary Jo Nye, were slain. A 14-year-old girl was wounded.

At around midnight, an Indiana man visiting Kalamazoo with his wife and in-laws decided to call for an Uber ride after hearing about the shooting spree. They were told their driver's name would be Jason, and he would be driving a Chevrolet HHR.

The couple, who told Fox17 they did not wish to be identified, said the driver seemed to be aware of the news about an active shooter.

""I halfheartedly joked at him and said 'You are not the shooter are you?',"" the man said, ""and he said 'no, and I said are you sure, and he said no, Im just really tired.'""

Dalton told his passengers that he had been driving for seven hours that day. The couple said they did not smell gunpowder or notice a weapon inside the car. WOOD-TV reported that the foursome were dropped off at a Radisson hotel at around 20 minutes after midnight.

About 20 minutes later, he was arrested without incident after a deputy spotted his vehicle driving through downtown Kalamazoo after leaving a bar parking lot. A semi-automatic handgun was found in the car.

Claire and Mark Timmins lost their son Mason to the disease two weeks before Christmas 2013, according to news.com.au. They had been storing photos of his last days on Earth in a box until the death of another British child, 2-year-old Faye Burdett on Valentines Day, prompted an outpouring of support for nationwide vaccination against meningitis B among children.

The BBC reported that Lee Booth, of Gasthead, started a petition for the vaccine after he said doctors deemed his daughter too old for it. The death of Faye, who isnt related to Booth, fueled support for the petition which had garnered more than 640,000 signatures and counting as of Monday morning. Because the number of petition signatures has surpassed 100,000, Parliament will consider the recommendation, the BBC reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, recommends that preteens, teens and young adults at an increased risk of meningococcal disease get vaccinated to protect against the serogroup B type.

The Timmins family said their decision to release photos of their late son was easy.

So many people responded through shock from [Fayes death], and so we thought if its going to make a difference we should use our photo (sic) as well, they said, according to news.com.au.

While Faye suffered from a rash prior to her death, Masons meningitis exhibited with vomiting. Twenty-four hours after the episode, Mason died at the hospital in his parents arms, news.com.au reported.

Hopefully it will shock people into finding out more about meningitis, the Timmins family said, according to the news website.

If the technology, known as mobile device management, had been installed, San Bernardino officials would have been able to remotely unlock the iPhone for the FBI without the theatrics of a court battle that is now pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns.

The service costs $4 per month per phone.

Instead, the only person who knew the unlocking passcode for the phone is the dead gunman, Syed Farook, who worked as an inspector in the county's public health department.

The iPhone assigned to Farook also lacked a Touch ID feature, meaning the FBI cannot use the dead gunman's thumbprint to unlock it now. The FBI found the phone in a car after the shootings.

A U.S. magistrate last week ordered Apple to provide the FBI with highly specialized software that could be loaded onto the work-issued iPhone 5C used by Farook. He died with his wife in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in December.

The software would help the FBI hack into the phone by bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.

The FBI said it wants to determine whether Farook had used his phone to communicate with others about the attack.

FBI Director James Comey said the agency owes it to the victims of the San Bernardino terror attacks to try to gain access to a cellphone used by one of the gunmen. In a message posted Sunday night on the Lawfare blog, Comey said the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

Apple has said it will protest the ruling and has until Friday to intervene in court.

San Bernardino had an existing contract with a technology provider, MobileIron Inc., but did not install it on any inspectors' iPhones, county spokesman David Wert said. There is no countywide policy on the matter and departments make their own decisions, he said.

MobileIron has confirmed that if the software were installed on the iPhone, it would unlock it.

Wert disputed the value of the remote management technology because he said Farook  or any other county employee  could have removed it manually. That would have alerted county technology employees and led them to intervene.

In many offices and classrooms, officially issued smartphones include the installed management software. It can unlock the phone, delete all information in case of loss or theft, track the device's physical location, determine which apps are installed, check battery life and push software updates. The technology is intended to make such products more suitable in corporate environments, where tighter controls are important to protect company secrets.

""This is the business case"" for mobile device management, said John Dickson, a principal at Denim Group Ltd., a security consultancy. ""The organization simply has no control or influence or anything over the device unless they have some MDM authority. The ability to do remote air updates, the ability to do remote wipe, the ability to control certain settings. Those are the standard kinds of things you do in mobile device management.""

Dickson said ""the big question now going forward, it builds the case for, is why this guy would have an essentially uncontrolled device.""

This is the first time since the county issued its first Blackberry device in 2003 that law enforcement has needed access to a locked county-owned phone, Wert said. Prosecutors said in court filings that the county gave its consent to search the device. County policy said digital devices can be searched at any time and Farook signed such an agreement.

Apple executives said Friday that the company had worked hard to help federal investigators get information off the locked iPhone, suggesting they use an iCloud workaround while the phone was connected to a familiar wireless network so that it would begin automatically backing up and provide access to data. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing legal process.

The executives said Apple sent engineers to work with the FBI on the workaround but the effort ultimately failed. The FBI said it worked with the county to reset the iCloud password a few days after the attack to try to get immediate access to the data. That effort eliminated the possibility of the Apple suggested workaround actually succeeding.

But if the county had installed the management device it had bought onto Farook's phone, none of these efforts would have been necessary.

Ted Olson, a lawyer for Apple, told ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday that the legal fight had evoked an important debate about privacy and civil liberties. But he warned there'd be no limiting what the government could require Apple to do in the future if the Justice Department got its way this time.

""Apple has a responsibility to maintain the trust and faith of millions of people who've depended upon Apple to produce a product that protects their privacy  their intimate, personal life,"" said Olson, a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ""This is a Pandora's box.""

Gartner Inc., a technology research firm, estimated that over 60 percent of large enterprises  meaning business, government and educational entities  used some kind of MDM software as of last year, though not necessarily on all company-owned devices. That percentage is likely higher now than when the research was done months ago, said Terrence Cosgrove, a research director with Gartner's mobile and client computing research group. Cosgrove said MDM adoption rates are generally higher among government users.

Many workers balk at the idea that the software can monitor and track their personal phones, said Alex Heid, chief research officer at the cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard Inc. But if the company provides a phone, it's considered reasonable practice to use such software.

""If a company's assumption is that they might not be able to get back into a device one day, then it's not really a company asset at that point, it's a gift,"" he said.

Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday, Fox News projects, beating Bernie Sanders and breathing new life into her campaign just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

Though the victory appears to be a narrow one, Clinton is hoping the win will serve to undercut Sanders' momentum as they head next into several delegate-heavy contests.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.

With 66 percent of precincts reporting in Nevada, Clinton has 52 percent to Sanders' 48 percent.

The balloting in Nevada coincides with the Republican primary Saturday in South Carolina, where front-runner Donald Trump is hoping for a decisive win.

In Nevada, Clinton was looking to rebound after losing big to Sanders in the party's New Hampshire primary, and only narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses.

The candidates spent their final hours before the caucuses furiously trying to drive up turnout among their supporters.

Significant spending by Sanders on paid media and staff helped his campaign make inroads into the Latino and African-American communities, which make up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate in the state.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,How dementia can unlock creativity in some people,[],"When Victor quit his job as a lawyer at the practice he founded and moved in with his mother, his family suspected that something was amiss. For a man in his early 50s with no other job prospects, the decision just didnt make sense. As described in a 2009 case study in the journal Neurocase, things only got stranger from there.

Victor became a compulsive coin collector, scavenging for loose change in the street or in other peoples bags. He stopped showering or using deodorant and took to wearing unwashed Hawaiian shirts and sandals. He spoke less and struggled finding words. Most surprising of all, he became a prolific artist, adorning canvases with richly colored portraits and creating lavish sculptures.

Victor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, shrinkage of the brains frontal and temporal lobes. The second most common cause of early-onset dementia, it brings on personality change and a neglect of social decorum. With his diagnosis, he joined a growing cohort of patients for whom their dementia sparked newfound artistic potential. The connection was described as far back as the late 1990s by the neurologist Bruce Millerand today, with modern neuroimaging techniques, researchers are beginning to discover how this disease might hold the keys to understanding creativity.

There are several theories on the connection between dementia and artistry. The first involves the prefrontal cortex, contained within the frontal lobe, home of high-level analysis and planning. When the region is damaged in frontotemporal dementia, people stop filtering their behavior and let go of their inhibitions. In the absence of the prefrontal lobes self-monitoring, an underlying creative drive emerges.

Consider a poet engrossed in the process of composition. A 2015 study from the journal Human Brain Mapping shows that while she is in the zone, the lyrics flowing freely from her mind to her pen, the prefrontal cortex is partially deactivated. But when the poet begins to edit her piece, the prefrontal reignites. Similarly, jazz pianists use the prefrontal cortex less while improvising than they do while playing well-rehearsed pieces. Shutting down this region seems to lead to unchecked creative expression. In fact, many of Victors paintings were sexually suggestive, and his portraits of family and friends sometimes betrayed unflattering feelings about them. His loss of a filter from prefrontal damage was manifested not only in his socially inappropriate behavior but also in his artwork.

Chicago, home of Michael Jordan. Where Phil Jackson won six NBA titles before winning five more with Bryant in Los Angeles. The city Bryant infamously said he was headed during the most contentious time of his Lakers career.

And now, in 2016, home of Pau Gasol, who won a pair of titles with Bryant in 2009 & '10 in purple and gold.

Sure enough, Gasol honored his ex-teammate and future Hall of Famer, introducing Kobe one last time to the Windy City faithful before the game:

.@paugasol introduces @kobebryant for one last time in Chicago, IL https://t.co/hGtoB5FXkK  NBA TV (@NBATV) February 22, 2016

Here is a better view of Gasol's words for Bryant:

.@kobebryant's last intro to Chicago. Led by @paugasol https://t.co/0Mx0dhskke  NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 22, 2016

Then ... the Lakers do what they do nearly every game this season -- served up an easy W for an opponent.

Bryant scored 22 -- one more than Gasol -- on 8-of-20 shooting (a good night by 2016 Bryant standards). But the Bulls shot better from the field and had more than double the assists the Lakers had en route to a 126-115 win.

""Not many players have played 20 years in this league, especially as aggressive as he plays every night,"" Gasol told the media of Bryant after the game.

He has received similar tributes in other cities during his farewell tour, but Bryant admitted this one was different because it's where Jordan, his idol, played for so long.

""It's always been different from the first time I played here,"" Bryant told the media in Chicago. ""There's such an air. You can feel the electricity in the building, to feel the championships and the history.""

The game wasn't without its drama, however, as a late Lakers comeback brought Bryant off the bench to the delight of the crowd chanting his name to come back in.

Before Bryant returned, Los Angeles made a run, cutting the lead to 108-105 on Nick Young's 3-pointer midway through the fourth. The Lakers, though, couldn't get any closer as the Bulls hung on.

Bryant returned with 3:08 remaining and the score 117-110. He left with 45.3 seconds left with the Bulls up 124-113.

But if you ask Bryant, this may not be the last time he crosses paths with Gasol on the court.

""That's the last time I'm going to face him,"" Bryant said. ""That's weird ... unless we play pick-up ball in Barcelona somewhere.""

And at least the game ended like this:

foxnews,2016-02-15 00:00:00,"Giant flightless bird once roamed the Arctic, scientists say",['Michael Casey'],"More than 50 million years ago, a giant flightless bird that weighed several hundred pounds lived in the Arctic.

Based on a single toe bone first found in the 1970s, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the University of Colorado Boulder determined that the bird, named Gastornis, lived in the Arctic Circle on Ellesmere Island.

""People thought there was a larger bird up there but the fossils had never been described,"" CU-Boulders Jaelyn Eberle, a co-author of a study on the bird that appeared in Scientific Reports, told FoxNews.com of the bone which was in the collection of the Canadian Museum of Nature.



""There are lots of wonderful discoveries we can make in the field,"" she said. ""But I would say there are a lot of great discoveries that can be made in collections that have been hanging around for a while but, for whatever reason, hadn't been described. We knew there were birds but nothing had been described until this paper.""

Related: Fossil of massive crocodile found on edge of Sahara desert

Eberle and the lead author on the study, Thomas Stidham, then compared the bone to those of similar bird fossils found in other parts of the world. They concluded it may be of the same genus as giant birds found in mid-latitude locations.

""Gastornis has been known from mid-latitudes for a long time, from Wyoming, Colorado, Europe. What we were able to do was compare that fossil from the Arctic to all of these mid-latitude specimens,"" she said. ""I think what is interesting is that the toe is virtually identifical to specimens from Wyoming. The difference is they are 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) apart. That is kind of strange.""



Coming upon this bird would have been a terrifying sight and researchers initially believed it was a fearsome carnivore. It would have stood 6-feet-tall and been about the size of an adult male with a head about the size of a horse's head.



Related: Fossils of rats as big as dogs found in Southeast Asia

But more recently, other researchers had found that it been a vegan, using its huge beak to tear at foliage, nuts, seeds and hard fruit. And unlike the harsh conditions of Ellesmere Island today where temperatures can drop to minus 40 degrees in winter, the birds environment about 53 million years ago would have been similar to cypress swamps in the southeast, Eberle said.

""It was still formidable but it was the plants that had to be fearful,"" Eberle said.



Fossil evidence indicates the island, which is adjacent to Greenland, hosted turtles, alligators, primates, tapirs and even large hippo-like and rhino-like mammals.

Related: Fossil of ancient fish with massive jaws discovered in Colorado

And unlike modern day ducks and geese that migrate through the Arctic, Eberle said Gastornis was most likely a year-around resident. It would have had enough to plant material eat, she said, and probably wouldn't have had the energy to migrate elsewhere.

""We would hyphosize that a large bird, just like large mammals up there, could overwinter in the Arctic,"" she said. ""Because this is a land dwelling bird, I think they were permanent residents. Part of it is because - this is the same argument we use for the mammmals up there - it's energetically expensive for an animal that walks on land to travel from Ellesmere Island down the tree line each year.""","['giant', 'fossils', 'ellesmere', 'island', 'arctic', 'large', 'say', 'eberle', 'roamed', 'scientists', 'described', 'fossil', 'bird', 'researchers', 'flightless']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,"What do Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney share? Both are victims of a left-wing smear machine",['Fred Fleitz'],"This week, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) named my organization, the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a hate group because of our work highlighting the threat from radical Islam. CSP will join other conservative groups such the Family Research Council, Liberty Counsel and WorldNetDaily, all of which SPLC has smeared by listing them alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.

The SPLC is best known for its work decades ago fighting legal battles against segregation in the South. But it long ago morphed into a far left group with one purpose: manufacturing material to slander conservatives for use by the news media and on the Internet.

CSP President Frank Gaffney has been on another SPLC hate list for several years along with American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), Robert Spencer (the founder of director of Jihad Watch blog), Lt. Gen. William Jerry Boykin (executive vice president of the Family Research Council), WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah and other conservatives. Joining them on this list are an assortment of neo-Nazis, KKK members and white supremacists.

Dr. Ben Carson was placed on a SPLC extremist watch list in 2014 because of statements he made in defense of traditional marriage. But after a public outcry, the SPLC was forced to withdraw this designation and issue an apology to Carson in February 2015.

Among the many false claims in the SPLCs new list of hate groups is that Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy have been banned from participating in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and that Gaffneys banishment from CPAC probably earns him points with Trump.

Although CPAC and the Center have had some differences in the past, this is no longer the case. Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC last year and will have an expanded presence in 2016.

I will be speaking at CPAC 2016 conference next month on behalf of the Center on the Iranian and North Korean missile programs.

To show how sloppy the SPLCs research is, a 2015 SPLC report noted that Gaffney and the Center were present at CPACs 2015 conference and that the Center was a sponsor.

As ridiculous as the SPLC hate lists may sound, they often are taken seriously by the liberal media. These lists almost had deadly consequences in 2012 when Floyd Corkins, a volunteer at a gay-rights group, entered the office lobby of the Family Research Council with the intention of killing as many of the Councils employees as possible because of the organizations opposition to same-sex marriage.

Corkins shot and injured a building manager before he was disarmed. He decided to launch a killing spree against the Family Research Council and another conservative organization after he read about their opposition to gay marriage in the SPLCs hate lists.

While SPLC regularly lumps conservatives with neo-nazis and white supremacists for being anti-gay, anti-immigrant, Islamophobes, white nationalists or for miscellaneous hate (such disbelieving in global warming), it refuses to put liberal individuals and groups on their hate lists.

For example, the SPLC had nothing to say last summer when left wing groups like MoveOn.org, the Daily Kos, Credo and the National Iranian American Council attacked Jewish congressmen who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) by questioning their loyalty to this country.

Elliot Abrams decried this bigotry in an August 10, 2015 article in The Weekly Standard:

The basic idea is simple: to oppose the presidents Iran deal means you want war with Iran, youre an Israeli agent, you are in the pay of Jewish donors, and you are abandoning the best interests of the United States. So Dan Pfeiffer, senior political adviser to Obama until this winter, tweeted that Senator Charles Schumerwho announced his opposition to the Iran deal last weekshould not be Democratic leader in the Senate because he wants War with Iran.

SPLC also has been silent on a growing anti-Semitism on the left and how American colleges are ignoring violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States.

On the other hand, the SPLC has joined President Obama in jumping on the fraudulent Islamophobia bandwagon. Thats why CSP and Gaffney caught its attention.

I join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group.

The Islamophobia charges made against CSP and other critics of radical Islam have nothing to do with hate or bigotry  they are a ploy by Mr. Obama, American Muslim groups and liberal groups to sidestep how Islamist extremism represents, as American Islamic Forum for Democracy President Zuhdi Jasser has put it, a problem within the house of Islam.

This problem is the global jihad movement which is an ideology at war not just with modern society but also with the majority of the worlds Muslims.

This is the real hate: Islamic supremacists cloaking their intolerance and hatred towards anyone who rejects their extremism  Muslims and non-Muslims  as protected religious practice. This hate includes brutalizing and killing groups that the SPLC claims to protect: women, LGBT individuals and racial and ethnic minorities.

The SPLC designated Frank Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy as haters because of our work to publicize the threat posed by to the supremacist Islamic shariah doctrine, a threat that President Obama and liberal groups refuse to confront or even name. They are in denial about this threat and instead condemn as bigots anyone who tries to address it.

This was crystal clear when President Obama on February 3 visited a mosque in Baltimore with known terrorist ties but refuses to meet with Muslims like Dr. Jasser who is leading an Islam reform movement that rejects Islamist radicalism and ISIS.

American leftwing groups like SPLC have also stubbornly ignored flagrantly hateful statements by some American Muslim groups.

There was a glaring example of this after the San Bernardino shooting when Hussam Ayloush, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told CNNs New Day, some of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism. ... We are partly responsible.

In May 2004, Ayloush said the U.S. war on terror was a war on Muslims, adding his belief that the 9/11 attacks were committed because of the U.S.s unconditional support of Israel. The U.S. is Israels partner in crime against the Palestinians, Ayloush explained.

How can a supposed civil rights organization like the SPLC give Ayloush and CAIR a pass on such hateful statements and actions?

How can it not speak out against growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States?

One reason is that the SPLC is not a civil rights organization  it is a far left advocacy group that tries to discredit its political enemies on the right with incoherent hate lists that wrongly associate them with notorious bigots to advance a liberal agenda. This is consistent with #12 of Saul Alinskys ""Rules for Radicals"": Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.

SPLC also demonized conservatives with bogus hate charges because it has found this kind of fearmongering to be very lucrative. According to the SPLCs 2014 tax return, this non-profit organization had $54 million in revenue and $315 million in assets.

Back in 2000, an investigative report into the SPLCs activities was published by Harpers Magazine titled The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance. It described the SPLC and its activities as essentially a fraud that shuts down debate, stifles free speech, and most of all, raises a pile of money, very little of which is used on behalf of poor people.

Perhaps the main reason the SPLC has been able to raise such huge sums because its president, Morris Dees, is so skilled at using scare mongering mailings for fund raising that in 1998 he was inducted into the Direct Mailing Association Hall of Fame.

Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.

The author of this article asked, What I'm very curious to learn is how keeping hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in assets, several offshore bank accounts and part ownership in foreign financial firms in any substantive way addresses poverty in America.

I believe the SPLCs new focus on Islamophobia is because the organization has identified attacking critics of radical Islam as the ultimate money pot. For example, Saleh Abdulla Kamel, a Saudi banker believed to have been a financer of Usama bin Laden, gave $10 million to Yale University in 2015 to build an Islamic law center.

Given the SPLCs lack of scruples, greed and offshore operations, I believe it is very likely that this group is receiving funding from Gulf state billionaires like Kamel to discredit anyone who criticizes radical Islam and the global jihad movement.

The news media must stop being manipulated by the SPLCs calumny of its political enemies.

Reporters should realize that an organization which attacks all critics of radical Islam as Islamophobes, refuses to mention the extremism and intolerance of radical Islamist groups, and is silent on the growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish university students cannot be considered a neutral and authoritative source.

The media also needs recognize that the SPLCs hate lists which lump Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney, Cliff Kinkaid and organizations like the Family Resource Council, WorldNet Daily and the Center for Security Policy with neo-Nazis and white supremacists are utter nonsense.

The press should instead be investigating the SPLCs enormous wealth, anonymous funders and how it is poisoning the public debate in this country to advance a liberal agenda and to enrich itself.

A rare weather event caused the spontaneous snowballs at the Nature Conservancy's Silver Creek Preserve and surrounding fields near the tiny town of Picabo.

Preserve manager Sunny Healey spotted the cylindrical shapes up to 18 inches high on Jan. 30 following an overnight windstorm. They created long lines in the snow as they moved.

""You could see the tracks that they made, and I thought that was really curious,"" Healey said. ""I had to stop a couple times. Then, along Highway 20, there were thousands of them.""

So-called snow rollers are so rare and fleeting that the precise weather conditions needed to form them are not defined, said Jay Breidenbach, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Snow rollers up to 18 inches are especially rare.

""Those are some pretty big rollers,"" Breidenbach said. ""I've seen some small rollers, but never that big.""

In general, it takes an unusual combination of a couple of inches of snow with the right water density and temperatures near freezing, followed by strong winds, he said.

""It can't be real dry snow or it would blow into drifts,"" Breidenbach said.

Rollers require some type of firmer base, such as a frozen layer of earlier snow, for the new powder to start rolling on. Plus, the wind must be strong and steady but not with powerful gusts that could damage the formations.

""It would probably blow them apart because they are fragile,"" Breidenbach said.

It snowed on Jan. 29, with the snow becoming wetter toward evening, Healey said. She lives at the preserve and said winds woke her up.

In her five years working at the preserve, she had never seen such an event, but a local rancher in his 70s told her he's spotted them twice in previous decades.

New Yorks Daily News, ticked off at the outcome, blamed the voters with this front-page screamer: CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.

In other words, TABLOID TO VOTERS: YOURE ALL LOSERS.

And the lead of the story was just as insulting: The piggish voters of South Carolina gobbled up the slop that Donald Trump served up Saturday  handing the bloodthirsty billionaire his second straight Republican presidential primary win.

I know the News, which is becoming a sad parody, despises Trump, having depicted him as a clown and, during his dustup with the Pope, the ANTICHRIST.

But that doesnt seem much different than the Huffington Post reacting to Donald Trumps first primary victory with a red-letter headline: NH GOES RACIST SEXIST XENOPHOBIC.

And it illustrates how, when it comes to Trump, some in the media are moving from denial to anger.

I wonder if a New York Times piece on the eve of the South Carolina primary is a more polite and sophisticated way of getting at the same pointthat the voters are to blame for making a lousy decision.

The Times has on-the-record quotes to back up its story line, but the underlying assumption is that Trump is just bad news:

Republicans in South Carolina have in recent years raced ahead of the national party in presenting an inclusive face to voters.

But in the face of this admirable progress comes a likely Trump victory: For party leaders and mainstream voters here, it may come as a kind of deflating climax...

His results in the two early-voting states so far have alarmed more traditional Republicans, who fear that a Trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of Republicans as an angry and intolerant party...

The fear among Republican leaders here is that a smashing victory for Mr. Trump would say more about the party, and about the state, potentially undermining South Carolinas image as a more welcoming place that is no longer defined by figures like Strom Thurmond.

Got it? The Palmetto State is now a welcoming place, but for Trump to win the primary would make South Carolina look like it was back in Thurmonds segregationist era.

As Trump has continued to gain strength, hes attracting a different kind of bad press, which tries to blame othersthe culture, the media, the Republican Partyfor what these critics see as the awful phenomenon that is The Donald.

Slate, in the process of slamming MSNBCs town hall with Trump, complains that the medias coverage of Trump has been soft, insufficient, and without substance because it has failed to deal with months of bigoted comments and almost pathological dishonesty.

Its that the medias relationship with Trump should worry Hillary Clinton, assuming each of them vanquishes their primary opponents. I would have said six months ago, perhaps naively, that a blatantly bigoted candidate would face such a sustained media firestorm (especially in liberal precincts) that he would be incapable of getting elected. Thats not yet the case. Indeed, there are no signs that the medias sick, interminable honeymoon with Trump will come to an end anytime soon.

Think about that. Trump is a bigoted and pathological liar, so any coverage that doesnt portray him that way, or confront him with his many sins, is embarrassingly anemic.

National Review Editor Rich Lowry, a fierce Trump critic, says in Politico that Trump is defining decorum down:

Weve grown used to how Trump has treated Jeb Bush in the debates, but that doesnt make it any less appalling a breach of political norms or basic decency.

The faces he makes while Bush talks, the constant interrupting, the petty put-downs  all of this would have been thought unworthy of the lowest political guttersnipe but have become an accepted part of the landscape thanks to Donald J. Trump...

The key to Trumps strength, which buttresses all his outrageousness, is that his supporters want someone to blow up the system. So there's almost nothing he can say or do that will discredit him in their eyes, and the least destructive scenario for his defeat  Trump blows himself up  will take some doing on his part.

Its all very entertaining  but so are demolition derbies.

Now theres an eye-catching metaphor.

National Reviews David French says both Trump and Bernie Sanders have risen from the wreckage of a broken culture:

The conservative culture we do have is still a celebrity culture, and Donald Trump has taken it by storm.

The secret of his continued dominance is that he does anger bigger and better than anyone else, and his fans are willing to forgive or even cheer any transgression against conservative principle or simple good taste as a result. All manner of cruelty and lies can be justified by fury at the Left, by rage at the GOPe, or by the cry of the other side does it.

Conservative leaders who were used to being the angriest and least politically correct people in the room now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of saying no  of saying that some things shouldnt be said and some ideas are genuinely offensive.

Back to the left, Salon paints Trump as a Frankenstein created by a pathetic GOP:

What makes Trump unique isnt his shameless sophistry or his crass rhetoric; he simply does what most politicians  especially on the right  have always done, only better and without limits. He knows his supporters  a majority of whom are old and white  dont care about policies (many of them have been voting against their own interests for years anyway), and so he goes straight to their sense of identity. Of course he cant make Mexico pay for a wall, but promising to do so assuages their fears of a country in which white people will, eventually, be a minority. If they cared about their jobs, that rage would be directed at the corporations that shipped them overseas, not the brown people coming here to park cars and pick fruit...

The GOP now consists mostly of old and angry white people who are rejecting a world they dont like or understand. The nativism and hysteria animating Trumps campaign has been at the center of Republican politics for a long time  Trump is simply capitalizing on it.

Old angry white guys, blatant bigotry, confederacy of dunces. Not much attempt here to discern why Trump has won the first two primary statesand giving him more ammunition that the press treats him unfairly.

Garbrandt hails from just outside Cleveland, Ohio but spent the early part of his fight career competing in Pittsburgh, so he had a huge local contingency coming out to see him this week.

Unfortunately, his opponent John Lineker came down with a case of Dengue fever that forced him out of the fight just a few days ago but Garbrandt was determined to remain on the card against whoever the UFC put in the Octagon with him.

Garbrandt has some firepower in those hands! Big knockout win for @Cody_NoLove! #UFCPittsburgh https://t.co/Hpq8SZd6IW  FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) February 22, 2016

Mendes was a high level Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner and it was clear he wanted to get the fight to the ground, but outside of one brief scramble, he barely found the mat until Garbrandt planted him there late in the first round.

Garbrandt stayed in complete control on the feet using his powerful hands to back Mendes up time after time while the grappler searched for answers as he attempted to avoid the knockout strike.

It was only a matter of time, however, until Garbrandt found a home for a beautiful left-right combination that floored Mendes with two vicious punches in a row. Garbrandt celebrated for a moment thinking the fight was over, but the referee didn't quite stop it so he was forced to jump in and deliver a couple more shots before Mendes was finally down and out.

The crowd roared for Garbrandt as he definitely got the biggest ovation for anybody on the card and after his third UFC win, he immediately asked for his previous fight with Lineker to get set up again.

""As soon as John heals from his illness,"" Garbrandt said when asked how soon he wants to fight again.

Whatever the case, a sickly sea lion caused quite a stir at a San Diego restaurant this week. It was found by staff sleeping in a booth early Thursday overlooking the ocean. It was soon was roused from its slumber and began poking around the restaurant.

I got to tell you when you see a little pup like this, it touches your heart. Its such a cute little thing, the Marine Rooms executive chef Bernard Guillas told FoxNews.com. It looked good to me. It was alert. Then they gave me the news, very much underweight. Ouch. I guess they need to be nice and chubby.

We found This little guy in the The Marine Room restaurant this morninghe was a little bit early for his high tide breakfast reservationas it is this weekend on Sunday and Monday Posted by Bernard Guillas on Thursday, February 4, 2016

Guillas, who joked on his Facebook page that the sea lion had turned up early for a reservation, said it was the first time anything like this had happened. A few times we have had big boys like the big sea lion standing in front of the door, he said. But they never made it inside.

The restaurant staff called the Sea World San Diego rescue team, which took the 8-month-old pup to its rescue center. Weighing only 20 pounds and about the size of a small dog, it is considered a micro pup because it is about half the weight it should be for its age.

Despite its sickly state, Sea World officials told FoxNews.com that they were cautiously optimistic that they could nurse it back to health and eventually return it to the wild. It is currently in Sea Worlds rehabilitation center, where veterinarians and animal care specialist are stabilizing the pup and hydrating it.

Sea World officials believe the sea lion found into its way into the restaurant a warm, dry place to rest.

The pup is only the latest young sea lion to turn up in a strange place along the California coast. With high tides as well as warming waters from El Nino limiting the sea lions food supply, they have been increasingly washing up on shore since 2013 - turning up on beaches and found wandering on California city streets.

In San Diego alone, Sea World has rescued 40 sea lions already this year and 990 in all of 2015  a record number of rescues in a year.","['little', 'san', 'restaurant', 'sleeping', 'sickly', 'lion', 'california', 'sea', 'room', 'world', 'pup', 'rescue']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,2016 Chevrolet Camaro V6 Test Drive,['Gary Gastelu'],"Sure, you couldve had a V8. But V6 pony cars are the best. Its true!

Well, its true if you care only about style, or if you run a car rental agency. At least thats how its been for the past 50 years, but not anymore.

The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro may still look like the Transformer that vanquished the Ford Mustang on the sales charts after the nameplate returned from hibernation in 2010, but its an all-new and far superior machine.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Chevrolet)

The Camaro it replaces was based on a big, heavy, full-size sedan (then known as the Pontiac G8, now the Chevy SS) and often felt more like Optimus Prime than Bumblebee. Its increasingly potent V8 engines did a good job of hiding this, but it was compromised  and the V6 was overmatched and out of its league.

Still, that didnt stop people from buying. It was the best-selling Camaro by far, but the only excitement it delivered was visual. The new sixth-generation Camaro has plenty of that, but now it shares a platform with Cadillacs acclaimed ATS compact coupe. Its stiffer, smaller in every dimension and a couple of hundred pounds lighter  and those are all wonderful things.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Chevrolet)

Its so trim that Chevy saw fit to make the base engine a 275 hp 4-cylinder turbo, a Camaro first. But while theres a tempting 455 hp V8 at the top of the lineup, its the V6 thats suddenly the most compelling option.

The V8-powered Camaro SS starts at an ambitious $37,295, a $2,795 jump from last year and $4,000 more than a Mustang GT. The V6 model has a base price of $28,190 and comes with a 335 hp 3.6-liter engine thats more than up to the task, thanks to the Camaros trip through the Weight Watchers drive-through.

An 8-speed automatic transmission will likely be chosen by nine out of 10 buyers, but the standard six-speed manual is perfection with a clutch. Each shift is as crisp and direct as loading a Remington 700, and the pedals are positioned close together for easy throttle blips under braking, which required the feet of Shaquille ONeal to do in the last Camaro. Even Mazda Miata owners might be impressed.

Its a true drivers car now, with synapse-quick responses and a neutral stance through curves that can easily be turned into a drift with an authoritative application of power. It also sounds the part, with a revvy, raspy voice that you can enhance with an available $895 dual mode sport exhaust that includes a hushed Stealth setting that will keep the neighbors happy.

It does the cruising thing better than ever, too. Those Cadillac bones bring a level of refinement that contradicts the Camaros juvenile image, even rolling on the big 20-inch wheels and low profile tires that came with my test cars $1,950 RS package.

Related Image Expand / Contract 2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS interior shown (Chevrolet)

The cabin has a modern, well-dressed style thats an evolution of the fifth-generation Camaros, but this time with not one miss on the fit and finish front. Entertainment is handled by an Apple CarPlay-equipped touchscreen system, while an epic row of buttons below it takes care of the climate controls.

The one thing Chevys designers didnt improve, however, is the Camaros outward visibility. Those short, photogenic windows are confining when you get in, like putting on a medieval helmet for the first time. You get used to it, but the optional blind spot monitor and collision warning system are worthwhile options. Thats the price you pay for driving around inside a Hollywood action hero, I guess.

Based purely on performance, this Camaro easily outclasses both the V6 and Turbo 4-cylinder Ford Mustangs, and thats coming from a lifelong Mustang guy. And while Im not sure how many people would actually cross-shop it against the likes of the BMW 2-Series, if you can handle being an extrovert, you should.

Dont get me wrong, Im very much looking forward to trying out the V8, and I will soon. But for anyone who doesnt do the drag racing or track day thing, at $4,552.50 each, the money for those two extra cylinders would probably be better used burning a hole in your pocket than rubber.

Besides, the V6 does that just fine.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Cuban rookie, Red's Raisel Iglesias, says he is finally adapting to playing in MLB",[],"Cincinnati Reds pitcher Raisel Iglesias finished last year in mid-September because of fatigue in his right shoulder. By then, the Cuban rookie was worn down, on and off the field.

""Last year was a long, long year for me,"" Iglesias said through translator Tomas Vera. ""I thought the season would never be over.""

Iglesias was talking more about the differences in culture and the way the major league season unfolds when contrasted with Cuban society and the Cuban baseball season.

""I felt good about my body and the season I had,"" Iglesias said. ""I think the Cuban players have to get used to the long season.""

The 26-year old from Isla de la Juventad was a relief pitcher in Cuba, but his command of four quality pitches convinced the Reds to make him a starter. Iglesias had success in that role during his rookie season.

Iglesias went 3-7 with a 4.15 ERA in 16 starts. He had 10 or more strikeouts in three consecutive starts from Aug. 23 thru Sept. 2, the first pitcher in modern Reds history to do it.

Iglesias was the first major League rookie to fan at least 10 in three straight games since Hideo Nomo had four straight 10-strikeout games in 1995. Among rookies, Iglesias finished second with a 2.28 batting average against, sixth in ERA, sixth in strikeouts (104), ninth innings pitched (95 1/3) and tied for ninth in starts.

""Coming from a completely different system to this type of condition, I was not used to throwing in this kind of condition, but I feel happy with the season I had,"" he said.

The workload took its toll as he transitioned from the game in Cuba.

""It was impossible to understand how many innings Raisel threw in Cuba. The game is different with international play and the industrial league. I'm sure they play a lot of intrasquad games. Then he didn't pitch at all for a year,"" manager Bryan Price said. ""We put him on a flexibility program and started his throwing program later than the others in camp. We think the flexibility will make a difference.""

Iglesias has been playing long toss and doing exercises.

""I've never had good flexibility,"" Iglesias said. ""I've been doing stretching exercises at my home in Florida. My arm feels better. My muscles feel loose. I believe if you have a good off season program you can maintain yourself in a long season like this.

Price plans to get Iglesias into games between March 10-15.

""I expect him to be ready,"" Price said.

In addition to conditioning for physically for the long season, Iglesias is preparing to fully join the American community.

""One of my goals is to learn English,"" Iglesias said. ""That is fundamental for me. It's really hard to talk (with teammates), I will pick it up little by little. I like the way everything is organized in America. The cleaning and the hygiene. It is something that should happen in every country.""

Although the United States has opened diplomatic relations with Cuba in the past year, Iglesias can not return to his native country just yet.

""At this time, I can't go back, but I have no interest in going back,"" Iglesias said.

Harris County sheriff's Sgt. Cedrick Collier said the shooting happened in front of the teenager's mother and a sheriff's sergeant. Collier said the sergeant was leaving the building just after 5 a.m. when he noticed a car parked with its headlights on and approached to see if the people inside needed help.

Collier said the woman told the sergeant that she was there to turn her son in for the shooting that happened earlier in the morning in Katy.

""His mom got out of the vehicle and stated that her son shot someone earlier that day and that he was a person of interest,"" Collier said.

He said the sergeant drew his weapon and asked the teen if it was true. Collier said the teen responded ""yes,"" stepped behind the vehicle, pulled a gun and shot himself in the head. The teen was taken to a hospital, where he died.

The teen and the 25-year-old ""happened to be dating or seeing the same person,"" Collier said.

He said the mother talked to investigators after her son killed himself.

""She's obviously destroyed because she just witnessed her son commit suicide in front of her,"" he said.

The name of the teen and others involved have not been released.

Collier said the sergeant did not fire his weapon, but was placed on administrative leave so he can ""clear his head and make sure he's OK"" before returning to work.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,At least 130 dead after blasts rock Syrian cities,[],"Bombings claimed by the Islamic State group in the Syrian cities of Damascus and Homs killed nearly 130 people on Sunday, highlighting the threat posed by the extremists as the country's warring factions fight for the northern city of Aleppo and world powers chase an elusive cease-fire.

The blasts came as Secretary of State John Kerry said that a ""provisional agreement"" has been reached on a cessation of hostilities that could begin in the next few days. But he acknowledged that it's not finalized and all parties might not automatically comply.

A series of blasts ripped through the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus, killing at least 83 people and wounding more than 170, the official SANA news agency said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on local Syrian activists, said the blasts killed 62. SANA said the bombs went off near schools during the afternoon rush hour.

The neighborhood is home to one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines, which his heavily guarded by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and other Shiite militiamen from Iraq and elsewhere. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said the blasts were caused by a car bomb and two suicide bombers.

The bombings in the central city of Homs killed at least 46 people and wounded dozens, according to Syria's Foreign Ministry. The Observatory said 57 people, including 11 women, were killed by two car bombs set off in a mostly Alawite neighborhood. Syrian President Bashar Assad hails from the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

Syrian TV footage from Homs showed streets filled with debris and mangled cars, and the charred body of a man being taken away on a stretcher. Footage from Sayyida Zeinab showing people running in narrow streets as others carried the wounded, including several children. ""He's alive, he's alive,"" a man shouted as he tried to administer CPR to an unconscious man. The TV later called on citizens to donate blood.

The Islamic State group claimed both attacks. The extremists are dug in on the outskirts of the two cities and have repeatedly targeted Shiites, who they view as apostates deserving of death.

The deadly blasts may strengthen the government's argument that it should press ahead with a major offensive in the north of the country, where troops backed by Russian airstrikes are close to sealing off Aleppo, once Syria's largest city and commercial hub. Syrian insurgents, including Western-backed rebels, seized several neighborhoods in 2012.

The heavy fighting near Aleppo led to collapse of peace talks earlier this month. World powers later agreed on a ""cessation of hostilities"" to begin within a week, but the deadline passed with no letup in the fighting.

Kerry has since reached out to his Russian counterpart, and during a visit to Jordan on Sunday, said they had struck a ""provisional agreement"" and must now reach out to the opposing sides on the ground. Russia is a key ally of Assad's government, while the U.S. backs some of the rebels fighting to overthrow him.

Kerry declined to go into the details of the agreement, saying it ""is not yet done.""

""The modalities for a cessation of hostilities are now being completed,"" Kerry said, adding that it was ""possible over the course of these next hours.""

Assad meanwhile said his government was ready to take part in a truce as long as it is not used by militants to reinforce their positions.

""We announced that we're ready,"" Assad told Spain's El Pais newspaper in remarks published Sunday.

""It's about preventing other countries, especially Turkey, from sending more recruits, more terrorists, more armaments, or any kind of logistical support to those terrorists,"" Assad said in English in the interview, which was also carried by state news agency SANA.

Assad's government refers to all the armed groups battling to overthrow him as terrorists. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are among the leading supporters of the insurgents.

Assad said the Aleppo operation is not about ""recapturing the city,"" but ""closing the roads between Turkey and between the terrorist groups.""

The United States, Russia and other world powers agreed Feb. 12 on a deal calling for the ceasing of hostilities within a week, the delivery of urgently needed aid to besieged areas of Syria and a return to peace talks in Geneva. Aid shipments were allowed into several besieged areas last week.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he welcomed the latest provisional agreement and called on all regional powers to use the ""window of opportunity"" to exert their influence on the warring parties.

In northern Syria, meanwhile, the Syrian army captured 31 villages on Sunday that were controlled by IS, according to the pro-Syrian Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV and Hezbollah's Al-Manar station. Both outlets often have reporters embedded with Syrian troops.

Just look at the data: this year, 27 million Latino and 3.9 million Asian-American voters will be eligible to cast a vote. Combined with African Americans, minorities arent so minor anymore. They are poised to make up 31 percent of voters on Election Day, a decisive role that we will first glimpse in Nevada.

[The 2016 election] will likely be the countrys first glimpse in this cycle into a crystal ball that will show Americans what the not-too-distant future will look like  and how theyll vote. Non-white voters are crucial to choosing not just this President but every future President at increasing rates. - B. Monterosso & S. Bhojwani

In the next two weeks, first and second-generation American voters, including hundreds of thousands of Latinos and Asian-Americans, will have an opportunity to play a key, some would say decisive, role in Nevadas Presidential caucuses for both parties. They will demonstrate their collective power to turn out and unhesitatingly hold candidates responsible for their words and actions on the campaign trail  while also using their voting bloc to help candidates who advocate for all communities win.

The Silver State is remarkable because it will be the first truly representative glimpse into how Americans will react to the 2016 candidates, with the newest demographic reality in place. The states African-American, Asian-American and Latino populations are on the rise, and currently number 9.1 percent, 8.3 percent, and 27.8 percent, respectively.

In addition, nearly 20 percent of Nevadas residents are foreign-born. It will likely be the countrys first glimpse in this cycle into a crystal ball that will show Americans what the not-too-distant future will look like  and how theyll vote. Non-white voters are crucial to choosing not just this President but every future President at increasing rates.

United in our concerns, the new American majority will continue to demand that our countrys leaders reflect the nations shifting culture and genuinely connect with communities of color on our issues. For Latinos and Asians, job creation with living wages ranks as a top issue. Both communities also care about immigration, healthcare, education, workers rights, and climate change. Together, these communities, the fastest growing immigrant groups in the country, help to form the new American majority. The might of our electoral power will match any increasing extremism with the power of our ballots.

Yet, many presidential candidates seem not to have gotten the memo. Several, including some front-runners, continue to support anti-immigrant legislation and employ messaging that diminishes, demonizes and degrades immigrants and all new American communities. This is not just bad for the country but bad for the future of their own political parties. Furthermore,candidates using this rhetoric should tune in to the fact that it will not suppress the minority vote.

In fact, especially among Latinos, anti-immigrant rhetoric may lead to higher turnout. For example, in Arizona, Latino voters are believed to be responsible for the recall of State Senator Russell Pearce in 2012, in response to his anti-immigrant stance and support of SB 1070, commonly known as the Show me Your Papers law.

In the 2016 election cycle, despite some superficial talk of voter diversity, were missing the real point and the powerful potency of the new American majority  how voters are united around core issues and a desire for recognition and validation.

New American voters including Latinos, Asian Americans, and other immigrant groups will be critical to ensuring that our government works to meet the needs of all of its citizens not just the few in power. In short, rhetoric and legislation thats intended to dampen participation and keep diverse, minority communities in the shadows will actually backfire.

Candidates who underestimate our communities determination to be included and heard do so at their own peril.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) autographs a Spanish language version of his book, 'An American Son' during a campaign town hall meeting at the Crown Reef Beach Resort February 11, 2016 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Earlier in the week Rubio placed fifth in the New Hampshire primary, behind fellow GOP candidates Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Donald Trump, who won with 35 percent of the vote. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)2016 Getty Images

With two presidential candidates of Hispanic heritage, one of whom admitted to shortcomings when it comes to fluency in Spanish, the question has arisen about the extent to which skill level in the language is a fair measure of just how Hispanic somebody really is.

In a recent debate, Sen. Marco Rubio made reference to Sen. Ted Cruzs lack of Spanish-speaking skills, which prompted the Texan to utter a few words in Espanol.

Before he dropped out of the race after the South Carolina debate on Saturday, Jeb Bushs supporters likes to say that he is more Latino, in some ways, than either Cruz or Rubio because, among other things, he speaks Spanish fluently.

A new Pew Research report says that most Latinos surveyed say that speaking Spanish should not be tied to qualifying as a Latino.

Almost three-quarters, or 71 percent, said that being able to speak Spanish was not a measure of whether someone is Hispanic or not. Only 28 percent said that to be Hispanic, a person should speak Spanish.

Responses did differ somewhat between Latino subgroups, with 87 percent of those born in the United States dismissing Spanish speaking skills as a test of whether someone is Hispanic, compared with 58 percent of immigrants who rejected the notion.

At the same time, the share of Latinos who speak only English at home is rising. More than a quarter of Hispanics ages 5 and older live in a household in which only English is spoken, compared with 22 percent in 2006.

The Pew report noted: Rubios confrontation with Cruz, who recently became the first Hispanic to win the Iowa caucuses, was interpreted by some as a challenge to how much Cruz belongs to or identifies with the Hispanic community in the U.S. (Its worth noting that this is not a new tactic. Hispanic Democrats have been confronted before by fellow Latinos in a similar way.)""

While most Latinos say Spanish-speaking should not be a litmus test for Hispanic identity, they do feel that future generations of Latinos should be able to speak Spanish.

While language use differs among Hispanics  some speak only English, some speak only Spanish and some are bilingual  Spanish is still a characteristic that, for the most part, unites much of group, the report said. About three-quarters of Latinos, no matter where they are from, speak Spanish at home.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,China removing thousands from homes to hunt for aliens,[],"In what would make for a decent episode of The X-Files, the Chinese government is forcing more than 9,000 residents from their homes in order to better search for alien life in the cosmos.

China started work on FASTthe Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescopeback in 2011, Xinhua reports. It's scheduled to be completed this September. But first 9,110 residents living within three miles of the project need to be relocated in order toin the words of one Chinese official""create a sound electromagnetic wave environment."" According to the Guardian, such relocations are a ""Communist Party specialty,"" with millions having been moved in recent decades to make room for infrastructure projects.

Relocated residents will receive a little more than $1,800 each for their trouble. Once complete, FAST will be the largest radio telescope in the world200 meters greater in diameter than the current biggest in Puerto Rico.

One scientist on the project explained its size in terms of wine, for some reason, stating that if FAST were filled with wine, all 7 billion people on Earth could each fill five bottles from it.

The Chinese government hopes to use the telescope to look for signs of extraterrestrial life and study the origins of the universe. Its size will make a difficult job slightly easier.

""A radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe,"" the Guardian quotes a FAST scientist as saying.

""It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm. Time reports FAST will cost $180 million. (Maybe we can't find aliens because they don't evolve quickly enough.)

And they weren't a pleasant 30 hours, either. ""I've never seen an airsick bag used before and many were,"" one unfortunate passenger says. Flight 944 left Punta Cana on Monday afternoon but had to divert to New Hampshire after heavy runway traffic and low fuel prevented it from landing at JFK International, per NBC New York.

Things didn't get any better in New Hampshire, where the plane had to stay overnight because of rules on how many hours a crew can fly.

What's more, passengers had to wait two hours for customs officials to arrive from Maine before they could get off the plane, Gothamist reports. And even then they were only allowed off 20 people at a time.

The plane and its intrepid passengers once again made for JFK on Tuesday only to encounter 60mph winds. It was so bad that many passengers were either puking or getting oxygen.

One passenger tells NBC she ""thought the plane was going to break in half."" The plane was diverted again, this time to Boston, where passengers weren't initially allowed off.

""People were banging on the door,"" one passenger tells the Tribune. ""The captain was advocating to let us go."" They eventually got their wish, with many passengers giving up on the flight altogether and booking train tickets.

By the time the flight finally made it to its destination Tuesday night, only the heartiest 90 of the original 160 or so passengers were on it.

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,DOJ would allow Apple to keep or destroy software to help FBI hack iPhone,[],"The White House appears to be willing to compromise with Apple in its fight with the tech giant to comply with a federal court order to provide reasonable technical assistance in the governments investigation of the locked iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino gunmen.

The Obama administration told a magistrate judge Friday it would be willing to allow Apple to retain possession of and later destroy specialized software it was ordered to create to help federal authorities hack into the encrypted iPhone belong to Syed Rizwan Farook.

""Apple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders,"" the Justice Department told Judge Sheri Pym. ""No one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.""

On Tuesday, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the FBI hack into the phone used by Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December.

Although the judge instructed Apple to create the software for the FBI, she said it could be loaded onto the phone at an Apple facility. The Justice Department made explicit Friday that Apple could retain custody of the software at all times.

That's a good ""compromise position"" because ""they're giving all the power to Apple,"" Jason Healey, a former director on cyber policy at the White House, told the Associated Press.

""They're telling Apple, 'You hold the software, we're not asking you to put a backdoor in the encryption, we just want to be able to brute force this thing,'"" Healey said. ""If the precedent is this, that they deliver the phone to Apple and Apple does it, I think that's a pretty good precedent that can't be done en masse on the next thousand iPhones.""

Authorities want Apple to bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to guess the passcode. Apple has helped the government before in this and previous cases, but this time Apple CEO Tim Cook said no and Apple is appealing the order.

The Justice Department filed a motion earlier Friday to compel Apple to comply with the court order.

""Apple has attempted to design and market its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data which has been found by this Court to be warranted for an important investigation. Despite its efforts, Apple nonetheless retains the technical ability to comply with the order, and so should be required to obey it,"" the motion states.

While the judge on the case says the government is only asking for help unlocking one, single iPhone, Apple says the case is much bigger than that and sets a dangerous precedent. Cook says the company doesn't have a system to bypass the self-destruct one.

""Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks  from restaurants and banks to stores and homes,"" Cook said.

The company has an additional three days to file its opposition to Tuesday's court order which is now due on Feb. 26, a law enforcement official tells Fox News.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Pound plunges as Cameron makes pro-EU case in UK Parliament,[],"Uncertainty over Britain's future in the European Union sent the pound plunging Monday, as Prime Minister David Cameron tried to shore up support for remaining in the bloc when the U.K. holds a referendum in June.

The pound fell 2.1 percent to $1.4106  after touching a seven-year low of 1.4058  and also sagged 0.5 percent to 1.28 euros, as bookmakers shortened the odds on a vote to leave  though betting markets still favor a ""remain"" victory.

UBS Wealth Management said Monday it put the probability of a British EU exit  known as ""Brexit""  at 30 percent.

Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, said the next four months ""won't be a fun time"" for the pound, which has weakened in recent months.

""It's more the uncertainty that will weigh on the currency, rather than investors taking a view on the outcome and the implications for the economy, which are hard to argue either way,"" he said.

Many big businesses have warned that leaving the EU  with its open internal market of 500 million people  would hammer the British economy. But London Mayor Boris Johnson, a high-profile supporter of an ""out"" vote, said fears of economic catastrophe were ""wildly exaggerated.""

He likened he warnings to those who had issued apocalyptic warnings that if Britain did not join the euro single currency, the City of London financial district would suffer and ""great mutant rats would gnaw the faces of the last bankers.""

However, Johnson suggested his goal is to vote to leave, then reopen negotiations on terms of remaining in the EU.

""There is only one way to get the change we need  and that is to vote to go; because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says 'no,'"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

The rhetorical stakes shot sky-high as politicians began a four-month battle to sway British voters ahead of the June 23 referendum, with the opposing sides battling over whether EU membership made Britain more or less safe from terrorist attacks.

Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said Sunday that the EU's ""open border,"" and the inflow of millions of migrants from the Middle East and Africa, made it more likely terrorists could slip into the UK  though Britain is not part of the EU's borderless Schengen zone.

But Defense Secretary Michael Fallon argued that EU membership made the U.K. safer.

""It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism,"" Fallon told the BBC Monday.

""We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism. You need to be part of these big partnerships.""

He was echoed by Rob Wainwright, director of the European police cooperation agency Europol, who said that if London turns its back on the EU and the police cooperation capabilities it offers, ""it would make the U.K.'s job harder, I think, to protect the citizens from terrorism and organized crime.""

Cameron was due to make his case in the House of Commons Monday, arguing that a deal he struck Friday with 27 other EU leaders gives Britain ""special status,"" exempting the U.K. from ever-closer political bonds within the bloc and protecting the rights of the pound against the euro currency used by 19 EU countries.

Other European leaders have sometimes expressed annoyance at Britain's demands, but want the U.K., with its economic and diplomatic clout, to remain in the bloc.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said Monday that he hoped ""good sense will prevail"" in the British referendum.

Cameron's governing Conservative Party is deeply split on the issue, with as many as half of Tory legislators  and at least six of the 23 members of Cameron's Cabinet  in favor of leaving the EU.

FBI Director James Comey said late Sunday that the agency owed the victims of last December's San Bernardino terror attack a ""thorough and professional investigation"" in an effort to explain why law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help them gain access to a cellphone owned by one of the gunmen.

In a post on the Lawfare blog, Comey wrote that the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

The post was Comey's first public statement since Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into Syed Farook's work-issued iPhone. Farook, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in the Dec. 2 attacks.

On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with the court order. Early Monday, Cook sent an email to Apple employees saying that the FBI should withdraw its demand.

In the message, subject-lined ""Thank you for your support,"" Cook states that the company has ""no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists"" and believes abiding by the judge's order would be unlawful, an expansion of government powers, and would set a dangerous precedent that would essentially create a backdoor to the encrypted iPhone.

The Dachshunds, named Jose and Foxy, each has its own problem. Foxy seems to detest Seinfeld, and Jose wont stop barking.

Millan, who describes Cesar 911 as a show in which he deals with extreme behavior that have owners rethinking keeping their pets, comes to the rescue by paying a visit to the home of Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld.

The biggest challenge in the Seinfeld-Dachshund case?

Jerry being Jerry is very fun to be around, the whole entire time youre laughing, Millan said in an interview with Fox News Latino. That was my challenge  to not laugh because I wanted to be serious.

It was hard, but it was fun.

Other extreme behavior cases that Millan will be dealing in the new season involve dogs who fatally attack other animals. Millan said that is becoming more common as people bring non-traditional animals such as pigs and goats into their home as pets.

The cases this season are way more extreme than ever, Millan said, adding that he enjoys working with pets that seem incorrigible to others. One dog killed two pigs. Another dog killed four goats.

I dont like to say Lets give up on a dog, Millan said. I think Lets give up on being lazy, lets give up on thinking negative.

Millan came from Mexico as a young man with dreams of bringing his dog training gifts to his adopted homeland. He eventually built an empire around his love of dogs. It includes not just TV shows that became hits, but also books, pet products, magazines and a website.

The famous dog expert is not the only Millan debuting a new season.

His son, Andre, who many saw as a young boy on the Dog Whisperer, going along with his father to address dogs worrisome behavior, is launching the first primetime talk show for pet owners.

Pet Talk, where Andre, who is 21, will be a field reporter, will air on Friday, Feb. 19.

Like Cesar 911, Pet Talk will air on Nat Geo WILD at 10 p.m. Eastern Time, following Cesar Millans show, which airs at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

Ingraham compared the New York businessmans overarching campaign strategy to that of a Mafia syndicate: ""Trump's made a calculation that the only way to win [the election] is do what they did in the opening scene of the 'The Godfather,'"" Ingraham explained, ""You have to take out the other families.

Noting a favorite Trump target, former Florida Gov.

And he's doing it in a way that is really strident and really offends a lot of people.""

Ingraham said Trumps anti-Bush theme is a risky strategy, as theres ""a lot of affection, maybe, for the personality, the people, the patriotic side of the Bushes, an apparent nod to George H.W.

As the child of a Filipina mother and Jewish father, Cohen, now the executive chef and owner of New York City's Asian-inspired Pig & Khao, had different culinary inspirations than most of her contemporaries.

""At a young age I was eating a lot of adventurous kinds of foods that most normal people were not eating. So that kind of got me into Southeast Asian food, growing up eating it, she said. That influenced my palate as a kid.""

But when Cohen decided to become a chef professionally, she started off on a more traditional route. She went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and then worked in fine dining restaurants, with a focus on Italian cuisine.

She worked at the acclaimed Eleven Madison Park under Chef Daniel Humm and then later with Anne Burrell at Centro Vinoteca--both in New York City.

A stint on the show Top Chef brought her recognition and confidence as a chef (she placed 6th on Season 5 of the show). But she said that it took a year living in Southeast Asia to make her realize her true calling which wasnt the classic standards. ""I just got really bored with it,"" Cohen explains. ""I used to love cooking Italian food but I never got that same connection that I do to the food of Southeast Asia.""

She first needed to perfect her skills, so she moved to Asia for a year. She had guest stints cooking at some of the regions top rated restaurants, such as Hong Kongs BoLan. She spent a lot of time in Thailand and had an apartment in Bangkok, allowing her to absorb the local flavors and cooking techniques. And she had her Filipino family and friends show her their special dishes.

These experiences prepared her for her return to New York City to open the Pig and Khao (""khao"" means rice in Thai) to rave reviews. New York Times food critic Pete Wells gave her place a two-star review and Mario Batali recently named her a one of three raising star chefs to watch.

The restaurant aims not to be overly traditional and instead is the kind of casual place Cohen would want to eat at. ""The vibe of the Lower East Side suited me,"" she shares about the restaurant's hip Manhattan neighborhood. ""It allowed me to do the type of restaurant I wanted to do - for it to be not stuffy and to be a lot of fun.""

The human rights organization claims Moscow's warplanes have been deliberately targeting civilians and rescue workers in Syria over the last week.

Tirana Hassan, director of Amnesty's crisis response program, said the attacks are ongoing, with strikes documented on schools, hospitals and civilian homes.

She claimed the bombing of civilian targets by Russian and Syrian forces was in itself a war crime, but warned there have been consistent reports of additional bombardments which injure and kill humanitarian workers and civilians attempting to evacuate the wounded and the dead.

The Kremlin denies it has been hitting civilian areas and insists it is dropping bombs only on terrorist targets.

However, evidence obtained by Sky News suggests that this is not the case.

Footage filmed in Aleppo five days ago shows the graphic aftermath of what's claimed to be a Russian airstrike.

The video is harrowing. In it, the body of a five-month-old baby called Omar can be seen being pulled from the rubble.

His twin brother, sister and mother were also killed in the attack on a residential building in eastern Aleppo.

It is an area which is currently held by the moderate Free Syrian Army.

Rescue workers claim the assaults are happening every day, and that civilian areas are being hit by cluster and thermobaric bombs.

With the cease-fire non-existent, the refugee camps inside Syria and on Turkey's borders are growing every day.

More than half of Syria's population are now displaced - that's 11 million people forced from their homes by conflict.

And as conditions inside the camps are basic, many more people will soon start making the journey to Europe.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"New study slams Hollywood films, TV shows over lack of diversity",[],"In one of the most exhaustive reports on diversity in Hollywood, a new study finds that the films and television produced by major media companies are ""whitewashed,"" and that an ""epidemic of invisibility"" runs top to bottom through the industry for women, minorities and LGBT people.

A study to be released Monday by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism offers one of the most wide-ranging examinations of the film and television industries, including an ""inclusivity index"" of 10 major media companies -- from Disney to Netflix -- that gives a failing grade to every movie studio and most TV makers.

Coming just days before an Academy Awards where a second straight year of all-white acting nominees has enflamed an industry-wide crisis, the report offers a new barrage of statistics that further evidence a deep discrepancy between Hollywood and the American population it entertains, in gender, race and ethnicity.

""The prequel to OscarsSoWhite is HollywoodSoWhite,"" said Stacy L. Smith, a USC professor and one of the study's authors, in an interview. ""We don't have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.""

The study, titled the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, examined the 109 films released by major studios (including art-house divisions) in 2014 and 305 scripted, first-run TV and digital series across 31 networks and streaming services that aired from September 2014 to August 2015. More than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status. Some 10,000 directors, writers and show creators were examined, as was the gender of more than 1,500 executives.

The portrait is one of pervasive underrepresentation, no matter the media platform, from CEOs to minor characters. ""Overall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,"" the study concludes.

In the 414 studied films and series, only a third of speaking characters were female, and only 28.3 percent were from minority groups -- about 10 percent less than the makeup of the U.S. population. Characters 40 years or older skew heavily male across film and TV: 74.3 percent male to 25.7 percent female.

Just 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).

""When we start to step back to see this larger ecology, I think we see a picture of exclusion,"" said Smith. ""And it doesn't match the norms of the population of the United States.""

Behind the camera, the discrepancy is even greater. Directors overall were 87 percent white. Broadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.

Just 15.2 percent of directors, 28.9 percent of writers and 22.6 percent of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap is greatest: Only 3.4 percent of the films studied were directed by women, and only two directors out of the 109 were black women: Ava DuVernay (""Selma"") and Amma Asante (""Belle"").

USC's study, which the school has been publishing in various forms for the last 10 years, also seeks to add a new metric in the conversation. The ""inclusivity index"" is a report card for the performances of 21st Century Fox, CBS, NBC Universal, Sony, the Walt Disney Co., Time Warner, Viacom, Amazon, Hulu and Netflix. Those companies encompass all the broadcast networks, most major cable channels, all of the major movie studios and three of the dominant streaming services.

Each was rated by their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters; and of female writers and directors. None of the six major studios rated better than 20 percent overall; Time Warner fared poorest of all with a score of zero. The report concludes that the film industry ""still functions as a straight, white, boy's club.""

Disney, Sony, Paramount, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. didn't immediate comment Sunday night.

Some of the same companies, however, scored better when their TV and digital offerings were evaluated. Disney, the CW, Amazon and Hulu all scored 65 percent and above.

""When we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavor is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,"" said Smith. ""They're impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive -- Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree -- those companies, if they're producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this. We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive.""","['major', 'diversity', 'tv', 'media', 'study', 'lack', 'companies', 'report', 'directors', 'slams', 'speaking', 'characters', 'films', 'hollywood', 'film', 'shows']"

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,"Justice Scalia, conservative leader, remembered in Mass service for his devotion to faith, family",[],"Thousands of people paid their final respects on Saturday to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in a funeral Mass in Washington that celebrated the conservative leaders devotion to his faith and family.

God bless dad for his faith, said the Rev. Paul Scalia, one of Justice Scalia's nine children, who led the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The deeper he went in his faith, the better public servant he was. God bless dad for his love of his family.

The roughly two-hour-long service was attended by such leaders in government and law as Vice President Joe Biden, former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 95-year-old retired Justice John Paul Stevens and the remaining eight high court justices.

Among them were Justice Clarence Thomas who read from the New Testament.

There was no eulogy in a service free of bipartisan politics.

However, the Rev. Scalia, a Catholic priest serving the diocese of Arlington, Va., shared some personal moments from his fathers life.

Scalia said his father once unknowingly stood in his line to confess sins, a Roman Catholic sacrament.

 Like heck Im confessing to you,  Scalia recalled his father later saying. The feeling was mutual.

Scalia, 79, died unexpectedly last weekend at a remote Texas ranch. He had spent nearly three decades on the high court.

The service, which began on an overcast day, concluded with the funeral procession headed to a private burial amid sunlight breaking through a grey sky.

Scalias flag-draped casket was brought to the church Saturday morning, in a short trip from the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill.

Scalia's other sons and his sons-in-law served as pallbearers, carrying the casket into and out of the basilica, the countrys largest Roman Catholic church.

In additon to Scalia's wife of 55 years and their nine children and dozens of grandchildren, other dignitaries at the service included members of Congress and several federal judges who are considered possible replacements for Scalia. Among them were Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett and Chief Judge Merrick Garland, all of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Obama did not attend, despite criticism from some Republicans.

However, the president and first lady Michelle Obama were among the more than 6,000 people who paid tribute to Scalia at the Supreme Court building on Friday. His casket rested on a funeral bier that first held President Abraham Lincoln's casket after his assassination.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama's decision about the Mass was a ""respectful arrangement"" that took into account his large security detail.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, who also participated in the service, acknowledged the Scalia familys desire for a simple, parish-family mass, as much as possible.

Scalias unexpected death has touched off a sharp debate in Washington and across the country about whether Obama should nominate a replacement in his final roughly 10 months of office and whether he would attempt to make recess appointment -- appoint somebody to the high court while Congress is in recess over the extended Presidents Day weekend or during future recesses.

Republicans and others say the next president, who takes office in January 2017, should submit the nomination to the Congress.

GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz interrupted his campaign ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary to attend the Mass.

The Texas senator has been among those urging the Senate not to consider replacing Scalia until after the November election.

The GOP-led Senate is not expected to approve any appointment by Obama, who said after Scalias death he would make a consideration in time due.

Obama said Tuesday that he would not make a recess appointment full stop. But he said he would nominate somebody who would be indisputably qualified and whom any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

Never before had a funeral for a Supreme Court justice been held at the basilica. Three popes have visited the basilica: Pope John Paul II in 1979, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 and Pope Francis last year.

The game was 1-1, and two Trabzonspor players had already been shown red cards. As one would imagine, tempers were flaring.

foxnews,2016-02-12 00:00:00,How Russia controls American policy,[],"Weve seen this movienow playing in Syria-- before.

The Russians have developed a way of getting the U.S. formally to permit offensive Russian military operations against American partners on the ground, all the while calling it a ceasefire.

What the Russians are proposing in Syriaa cessation of hostilities on terms they get to define-- is exactly what they have been doing in Eastern Ukraine for more than a year.

The Minsk II accords, signed in February 2015 between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, with the U.S. in support, supposedly established a cessation of hostilities across all of Ukraine. But Russian proxies on the ground, with active Russian support, have continued to attack Ukrainian positions while loudly blaming the Ukrainians for violating the ceasefire.

Then as now, humanitarian concerns were a prime motive. The West thought the Ukraine ceasefire would keep pro-Russian forces from seizing the town of Debaltseve, then under siege. But Russian proxies took Debaltseve three days after the ceasefire came into effect.

Putin will use exactly the same techniques in Syria to achieve a similar objectivethe weakening or destruction of opposition forces the U.S. has been supporting.

This matters, because Aleppo is one of the last few bastions for opposition groups that offers any hope of a future Syria that is neither brutally oppressed by Assad nor controlled by Al Qaeda and/or ISIS.

The Russians, of course, claim that all of the groups in northern Syria are al Qaeda or ISIS or their allies.

That claim is a lie.

The opposition in Aleppo includes groups that the U.S. has been supporting. Several of those groups have received TOW missiles from the U.S., indicating that they have passed a rigorous vetting process designed to ensure that those weapons will not end up in the hands of ISIS and al Qaeda.

The Russian false claim that it is fighting terrorists is a cynical device to conceal Putins real aim, which is to re-establish the vicious dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in order to guarantee Russias possession of air and naval bases on the Mediterranean littoral.

What will happen next?

Heres a version of the worst case. Syrian forces, heavily supported by Lebanese Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias, and Iranian troops, still backed by extensive Russian air strikes, will continue their offensive operations around Aleppo, further isolating the opposition in that city and expanding the Assad regimes control.

They will also continue to strike civilian targets in the area, creating additional tens of thousands of internally-displaced people and increasing the refugee flow to Turkey.

Secretary Kerry will no doubt launch strong protests with the Kremlin over this issue, but the Obama Administration will take no other action.

The regime will thus complete its encirclement of Aleppo and proceed to the destruction of the groups the U.S. has been supporting--all in the name of a process that the U.S. has just agreed to.

The net result will be the further weakening of any moderate opposition the U.S. could work with and the strengthening of Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their allies.

For one thing, these military operations will disproportionately damage the remaining opposition without striking areas that sustain ISIS and al Qaeda in Syria.

For another, they will powerfully reinforce the claims made by ISIS and Al Qaeda that the U.S. has thrown in completely with Assad and will support the dictators efforts to crush the Sunni population, and that ISIS and Al Quaeda alone are the Sunni defenders.

In this way, the Russians will make their lies come true.

We have watched the Russians execute this playbook in Ukraine for more than a year. The Russians have actually published descriptions of how they manipulate the West in precisely this fashion and that they have made it their policy to do so.

Manipulating the U.S. to support Russias aims is, in fact, Putins primary goal and purpose.

It is astonishing that anyone who has participated in this scenario in Ukraine over the last year could imagine that the outcome will be different in Syria this time.

And yet, at Foggy Bottom and in the White House, they apparently do.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,How to make perfect homemade pizza dough,[],"Making your own pizza dough is relatively easy but takes a little time to perfect. (You might not toss and twirl your dough around like chefs on TV during your first pizza-making attempt.)



Ingredients

Basic pizza dough recipes call for yeast, warm water, flour, salt and olive oil. Some recipes call for the addition of sugar or honey, while others say it is not a necessary ingredient.

Click here for the recipe

According to RecipePizza.com, you can speed up the rising process by placing the dough in a warm place, but you are already taking the time to make the dough from scratch, so let it rise naturally. This should take between one and two hours, so keep an eye on it to determine when it has expanded to the proper size.

You can preheat your oven as the dough rises. To shape the dough ball, place on a lightly floured wooden board and sprinkle a little more flour on top. Press into a flat, pancake-like shape. Lay it on top of one fist and then gently stretch the dough by placing your other fist underneath, pulling and rotating. You can also use a rolling pin. Decide how thick or thin you want the crust to be, and you are on your way to a delicious pizza pie.

Pizza dough will keep in the refrigerator for several days. Cover the balls with plastic wrap, leaving it room to rise in the fridge. You can also freeze the dough and keep it in the freezer for several months.

Variations

According to RecipePizza.com, the use of high-gluten flour, sometime called bread flour, is key to achieving the proper elasticity in your pizza dough. Eating Well has an easy recipe for whole wheat pizza dough that uses a mix of whole-wheat flour, bread flour and cornmeal.","['perfect', 'placing', 'flour', 'recipes', 'rise', 'shape', 'warm', 'dough', 'homemade', 'proper', 'recipepizzacom', 'pizza']"

Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.



Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.



Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession  predict it often enough and youll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,Amateur archaeologist discovers lost Spanish settlement in Florida Panhandle,[],"An amateur archaeologist's discovery of 16th-century Spanish pottery shards has led to the unearthing of a long-lost settlement in the Florida Panhandle.

""There it was, artifacts from the 16th century lying on the ground,"" said Tom Garner, a history buff whose discovery has made him a celebrity in archaeological circles.

According to experts, Garners find at a newly cleared lot along the Pensacola Bay was the landing site of a doomed 1559 expedition led by Tristan de Luna. The discovery bolsters Pensacolas claim as the first European settlement in the modern-day United States, six years before Pedro Menendez founded St. Augustine on Floridas Atlantic coast. The Luna expedition was scuttled by a hurricane that sank five ships in September 1559, shortly after the fleet arrived.

Part of Lunas doomed fleet was discovered in Pensacola Bay in the 1990s. But the exact site where Luna and 1,500 soldiers, Mexican Indians and Spanish settlers lived for about two years had eluded searchers  until now. Many believed Lunas settlement had been washed away in storms or was entombed beneath centuries of land development.

Archaeologists from the University of West Florida are now digging in the quaint, waterfront neighborhood of homes and businesses.

John Worth, an associate professor of anthropology, specializes in Spanish colonial history and has studied Luna expeditionary documents. The university confirmed the find this fall and announced it to the archaeology world just before the beginning of the year.

""This gives us a whole new window on early Spanish colonialism here in the United States,"" he said.

Luna was ordered by Spain's King Philip II to construct a village that would include a church, government house, town plaza and a residential site. Archaeologists hope to find out how far the work progressed.

Worth said if Luna's colonization attempt had succeeded, it would have changed the history of North America. A lasting Spanish foothold in the Panhandle could have checked later French influence on the region, he said.

Cal Halbirt, city archaeologist for St. Augustine, said the discovery should add new understanding to Florida's colonial past.

""Having actual, tangible remains from the Tristan de Luna site is very important,"" he said. ""I think, from a level of wow factor, it ranks right up there.""

Meanwhile, St. Augustine proudly maintains its claim as the oldest continuously occupied European settlement city in the present-day U.S. ""There is definitely community pride because of that,"" he said.

As first reported by The Washington Free Beacon, the CIAs three-year Diversity and Inclusion Strategy says dedicated programs are in place to recruit individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, as well as from the LGBT community and elsewhere.

It says:

We will continue to enrich our workforce by targeting diverse communities across the United States to meet our talent needs, with dedicated programs for citizens of African, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Native American descent; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals; Persons with Disabilities; Veterans; and Women.

Progress toward these goals will be measured.

The three-year plan says they will monitor the diversity and gender break-down for recruiting trends  and resignations  and use so-called inclusion index measures to identify trends of the elements necessary for creating a diverse and inclusive environment.

The strategy is not contained to recruitment.

According to the plan, the CIA will hold agency-wide unconscious bias training as well.

Diversity and inclusion must become an integral part of our culture to position the Agency to compete for and retain top talent and cultivate a qualified bench of future leaders. Deliberative processes combined with greater diversity and inclusion awareness will help combat unconscious bias and foster fair and equitable decision-making, the plan says.

foxnews,2014-07-17 00:00:00,How to solve the border mess,[],"This is a RUSH transcript from ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" July 16, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!

O'REILLY: Back to Fox segment tonight. How to solve the border mess.

Joining us from Washington, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.

So Senator, top of the program we told the audience about polls that are coming in now on the border crisis. President Obama getting hammered. The vast majority of Americans think he is doing a terrible job there. However, just 23 percent of Americans believe the Republicans in Congress, of which you are one are doing a good job. 23 percent. So you guys are getting a blast as well. So my question to you is, if you were the president of the United States how would you stop this humanitarian disaster down there?

SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R) FLORIDA: Well, first of all, it wouldn't have happened because I never would have signed an executive order granting a deferred action to those who were in this country illegally. I think he was showing a tremendous amount of compassion, but that was not the right way to do it. It sent a message that actually invited people to come, and you see the disaster that has followed. The second thing, I would say, is that the first step in this process needs to be an all-out effort to finally put to rest the illegal immigration problem in America. And this involves the construction of strategic fencing, but also the deployment of specific technologies like ground sensors and cameras and drones and so forth to secure the southern border with Mexico. It involves a verify system, to require employers to verify that the people they are hiring are legally here. It involves an entry-exit tracking system, particularly at our airports, because 40 percent of our illegal immigration problem are people that enter the country legally and overstay visas. That would be the first step in this process, you have to do every single aspect of it, and only after you do that can you move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration .

O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100 percent, you have got to stop - you've got to stop the madness first. But let's deal with the kids now because this is the humanitarian crisis the whole world is watching. Number one, you have no fence in these hot sectors, you say we should. And I agree. Number two, Governor Perry of Texas is asking and has asked for years, the National Guard to get down and help the border patrol. Do you favor that?

RUBIO: I do, and again, that has to do with manpower and that would be a part of any effort to secure the border.

O'REILLY: OK. So you put the guard down there, you show the world the pictures of our military on the border. Right away just those pictures then would de-incentivize the people who are paying these terrible cartels to human smuggle. So you would have a solution. All right, now, why do you think the folks are holding it against the Republicans -- are they believing President Obama when he is trying to blame you, guys, for the border madness?

RUBIO: I think it is an indictment of all of Washington, of the failure for more than a decade to deal with the problem that we know exists. Unless you are in favor of the status quo, unless you look at what is happening now and say, I think, this is working for America you have to be in favor of fixing it. So that is not really the debate, the debate is how do you fix it? And in my mind, the first step in fixing this, is to stop the growth and the problem that we have right now with illegal immigration, and then to begin to erode that number, to lower it, so that you can move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration process towards one that is based on merit and works for our country in the 21ST century.

O'REILLY: OK, would you send the kids back?

RUBIO: Yes, and I'll tell you why that' important. Because the leading reason why this is happening, is word of mouth is spreading that if you make it to the United States as an unaccompanied minor or as a family with children you are going to be treated differently than adults who are traveling by themselves. And that word gets back, so imagine for a moment, if someone comes across the border, as a family or as an individual, they are now released into the population, with a notice to appear, but, of course, they never will, or do. And then what happens is, they call back home, people see they made the voyage safely, and you've now created a word of mouth incentive.

O'REILLY: Sure.

RUBIO: For others to do the same thing.

O'REILLY: All right, so you would send them back - you would get the increased courts, the judges down there to get them out, because that's going to be a big thing when that starts to happen. How many times have you spoken to President Obama personally about immigration reform?

RUBIO: Well, we've spoken a couple of times, but not in more than a year. And again, my conversations always begin with, what I've been saying publicly, and that is, anyone who is in favor of immigration reform must first be in favor of border security.

O'REILLY: And then how - what does he reply to that?

RUBIO: Well, I think they don't necessarily - well, two points - number one, the thing they'll say is the border has never been more secure, which is true for a handful of the sectors, but not for the others, not for the Rio Grande sector, not for the other sectors that we've seen, the Tucson sector of the border where people are crossing. And that has been the real challenge, is that the argument if you recall, he gave a speech in El Paso a few years ago where he mocked people who said we needed more border security by talking about how we would insist on a moat with alligators in it. And of course, now, we've seen that the border is in fact not secure.

O'REILLY: All right, Senator, we appreciate your time tonight, thank you.

The minister said: ""A land operation of Saudi Arabia and Turkey in Syria has never been on the agenda, and it is not on the agenda.""

However, Turkey views ground operations as necessary and would be a willing partner if the notion got approval from a broader coalition, an official said last week. The country raised the issue in recent talks with the U.S. and other Western nations, said the Turkish official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

The U.S., Russia and other world powers agreed Feb. 12 in Munich to bring about a pause in hostilities that would allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the revival of peace talks.

A Syrian opposition activist group says heavy fighting has cut off the government's only supply route to the northeastern city of Aleppo.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says clashes were underway Monday along the southeastern approaches to the city, which is bitterly divided between the government and the rebels, and also around the town of Khanaser.

The Observatory tracks Syria's civil war. A news agency close to the Islamic State group said the extremist group's fighters had cut the road.

Aleppo, Syria's largest city and one-time commercial center, is divided between the government and its opponents, while IS holds a wide front to the east of the city.

Since Apple's war with the FBI has taken center stage in the media following a federal judge's ruling that Apple must help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, I wanted to share some thoughts on the subject. After all, the FBI has laid a clever trap for Apple.

Here are five key things that need to be clarified.

1. Many have been misinterpreting the portions of Apple's public response letter with regards to the technique that might help break into the iPhone 5c being usable with other devices (if such a tool was created for other devices). This is not describing a technical issue, but is instead directly related to the later-mentioned issue of setting a precedent.

On a technical level, Apple could carry out the order by creating a RAM disk signed by the company's production certificate for the specific ECID of the suspect's iPhone. This solution would allow Apple to use existing technologies in the firmware file format to grant access to the phone ensuring that there is no possible way the same solution would work on another device.

The aspect that would actually affect the public is the fact that by doing this, Apple will show that breaking into an iPhone is ""possible,"" and allow the FBI to use this case in the future as leverage.

This is only possible on a technical level in very specific circumstances, but if Apple assists in this instance, then it paves the way for more unreasonable and technically difficult requests to be made. In those scenarios, it will be on Apple to try to explain why it cannot accommodate the new requests. The company will have to show definitively why it is different from the ""last time"" it assisted in a similar case, though there is no way to speculate on how exactly this might be leveraged.

2. Apple has been doing very well in many international markets, especially China, where the company has faced criticism with regards to security concerns. If Apple does not try to fight this court order vigorously, it will not look good to buyers around the world.

A comparison which comes to mind is the disappointment from a decent amount of BlackBerry users in the United States who admired the company for staying strong with regards to security and encryption, but then ""gave in"" when the Indian government demanded access to BlackBerry users' private data.

3. Although the passcode attempt counter on the iPhone 5c can be handled without much work, the FBI request to allow it to electronically make passcode attempts is a considerable issue. This would specifically require Apple to modify the source code of SpringBoard (which powers the lock screen) to specifically add code that enables this capability, and sign it with the company's production certificate so that the device will run the code. The reason Apple stresses that this is a ""backdoor"" in its statement is because the order is specifically requesting that Apple make a modification that serves no purpose other than to weaken iOS security by allowing brute force attempts. As touched upon in point #2, this will look horrible for Apple if it complies.

4. Here's something pretty vital that no one has mentioned yet: The custom signed RAM disk that the FBI is requesting will not be possible to boot using the regular TSS restore servers, which check the validity of firmware files that are being loaded during each restore.

To allow restoration to a custom firmware, Apple would need to either: (a) make changes to the way its restore server works for this specific case, potentially causing major security concerns if any sort of mistake is made (which could make this an unreasonable / burdensome request, or (b) bring the device onto its internal network and load the firmware using the restore server used internally, since it can be assumed that such an in-house server exists for the purpose of restoring to unreleased firmware versions.

Apple can of course easily point out the absurdity of this scenario to a layperson: Apple is likely not very comfortable with what could potentially happen on its internal network if it was forced to let in a phone that belonged to a known terrorist, as there is no telling what it might attempt to do, seeing as the FBI is claiming that there is data they need on the device.

There is no way to say whether these valid arguments or any similar arguments will be able to sway the court, but the important takeaway here is that there are a few avenues Apple can take with regard to technical arguments against being forced to carry out this order. IN other words, Apple's objections can go well beyond the moral arguments the company has posted publicly.

5. Another PR-related reason that Apple is opposing this order so vehemently is that it is aware of the fact that, if it complies, the FBI will be able to crack the passcode very quickly. From my own testing, a 4-digit passcode can be cracked in under an hour and a 6-digit passcode can be cracked in less than a day. Therefore, to the layperson, it won't be easy to dispute any claim that Apple has decrypted the device for the FBI. While it wouldn't technically be true, all that would likely matter is Apple taking actions that allowed the FBI to gain access to an iPhone's once-encrypted data.","['hacker', 'weighs', 'apple', 'security', 'technical', 'firmware', 'ios', 'order', 'way', 'iphone', 'legendary', 'passcode', 'fbi', 'war', 'apples']"

The Detroit Tigers infielder Mike Aviles reported to spring training in Lakeland, Florida, bearing good news: His 5-year-old daughter Adriana, who was diagnosed with leukemia last May, is now cancer-free.

Aviles, 34, told reporters, ""Everything's going well with her. She had a bone marrow transplant in December, she's recovering. She'll be out here in a couple weeks when she's allowed to fly. And she's cancer-free and going forward.""

The New York City native is starting his first season with the Tigers. He signed a one-year contract with them this offseason after three years with the Cleveland Indians. He and his wife, Jessy Poulsen, have twin daughters.

In August Adriana  bald at the time because of her treatment  and her sister Maiya got to throw out the first pitch at an Indians home game.

Several Cleveland players, coaches and front office employees, including owner Paul Dolan, shaved their heads in support of Aviles' family last season. The team also decided not to trade him midseason so he could spend as much time as possible near his family.

""It was a tough a situation, but it worked out good because I didn't get traded,"" Aviles said, according to ESPN.com. ""I was able to stay there and be around for my family.""

Aviles is entering his ninth season in the major leagues. He has a career .265 batting average with 58 home runs. While he has played most of his games at shortstop, he has become a versatile utility man who played all outfield positions as well as three infield spots last season while hitting .231 with 5 home runs in 290 at bats.

Bermudez had a battle on his hands early as Kawajiri showed off some real veteran prowess, but as the fight wore on, the top 10 featherweight showcased why he's considered one of the best 145 pound fighters in the world.

Bermudez made a decision to pursue an early submission attempt after taking Kawajiri's back for a moment, but his advantage quickly faded as the Japanese powerhouse worked out of the position and clung to him for the rest of the round.

Kawajiri's control is nearly unmatched while he's out wrestling his opponents and it left Bermudez searching for answers as time ticked away.

A tough opening stanza didn't deter Bermudez from rushing forward again in round two except this time he defended the takedowns from Kawajiri while raining down punches and elbows in the clinch.

Kawajiri stayed tenacious while constantly trying to get back on the ground but Bermudez punished him with strikes at every turn, never giving him a moment to breathe much less time to regain a better position.

While Bermudez had to know Kawajiri wanted nothing more than to get locked in a grappling match on the ground, he still pressed forward with his wrestling in the final round as well.

Bermudez did manage to land his best strike of the fight after the fighters separated and Kawajiri was turning to stand again and ate a head kick for his troubles. Kawajiri got his arms up enough to avoid getting knocked out but Bermudez certainly got his attention before following it with one more takedown to seal the deal on the judges' scorecards.

The final scores came back 29-28 all in favor of Bermudez, who snaps his recent two-fight losing streak inside the Octagon.

Bermudez suffered through those losses while facing a pair of top 10 fighters in consecutive bouts but now he's back on track as he looks to tackle the top of the division again.

Following the win, Bermudez mentioned two names in particular he'd like to face next -- either Ricardo Lamas, who defeated him in one of those two afore mentioned losses or a potential matchup against UFC Hall of Famer BJ Penn, who announced his return to action earlier this year after retiring in 2014.","['streak', 'bermudez', 'lamas', 'asks', 'hes', 'kawajiri', 'grinds', 'wrestling', 'moment', 'fight', 'fighters', 'ufc', 'penn', 'dennis', 'round', 'tatsuya']"

The human rights organization claims Moscow's warplanes have been deliberately targeting civilians and rescue workers in Syria over the last week.

Tirana Hassan, director of Amnesty's crisis response program, said the attacks are ongoing, with strikes documented on schools, hospitals and civilian homes.

She claimed the bombing of civilian targets by Russian and Syrian forces was in itself a war crime, but warned there have been consistent reports of additional bombardments which injure and kill humanitarian workers and civilians attempting to evacuate the wounded and the dead.

The Kremlin denies it has been hitting civilian areas and insists it is dropping bombs only on terrorist targets.

However, evidence obtained by Sky News suggests that this is not the case.

Footage filmed in Aleppo five days ago shows the graphic aftermath of what's claimed to be a Russian airstrike.

The video is harrowing. In it, the body of a five-month-old baby called Omar can be seen being pulled from the rubble.

His twin brother, sister and mother were also killed in the attack on a residential building in eastern Aleppo.

It is an area which is currently held by the moderate Free Syrian Army.

Rescue workers claim the assaults are happening every day, and that civilian areas are being hit by cluster and thermobaric bombs.

With the cease-fire non-existent, the refugee camps inside Syria and on Turkey's borders are growing every day.

More than half of Syria's population are now displaced - that's 11 million people forced from their homes by conflict.

And as conditions inside the camps are basic, many more people will soon start making the journey to Europe.

In a statement, Tillis compared both his and Rubios humble beginnings and the fact that they are both first-term senators and former state House speakers.

""Marco lived the American Dream, and he will ensure that each and every one of us can do the same,"" Tillis said in the statement, adding Rubio ""has the unique capability of drawing new people into the party, which is critically important in a swing state like North Carolina.""

North Carolina will hold its GOP primary on March 15 along with four other states, including Rubio's home state of Florida.

North Carolina is the 9th largest state by population and its general election voters narrowly chose Mitt Romney in 2012 and President Barack Obama in 2008.

With Tillis endorsement, Rubio is now focusing on the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday  the first time Republican candidates will face a significant Latino population. The contest is a homecoming of sorts for Rubio, who spent part of his childhood living in Nevada.

On his way to the Silver State, on Sunday the freshman senator made campaign stops in Tennessee and Arkansas, where he invoked immigrants and the nations history with slavery.

He cast himself as his party's most electable candidate because he can help grow the GOP beyond its traditional base of older, white voters. He drew from his parents' story as Cuban immigrants during a Sunday afternoon rally in suburban Nashville.

""Americans are the descendants of go-getters,"" Rubio said.

He continued, ""Americans are the descendants of people who came here whether it was two centuries ago or two years ago because they refused to live in a society that told them they could not be who they wanted to be. America is the descendants of slaves who overcame that horrifying institution to claim their stake to the American dream.""

Instead the U.S. called for North Koreas atomic-weapons program to be simply part of the talks. Pyongyang declined the counter-proposal, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. Its nuclear test on Jan. 6 ended the diplomatic gambit.

The episode, in an exchange at the United Nations, was one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obamas second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.

The State Department on Sunday acknowledged the U.S. exchange with North Korea, saying it took place in accordance with longstanding U.S. goals.

To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty. We carefully considered their proposal, and made clear that denuclearization had to be part of any such discussion, said spokesman John Kirby, adding the North rejected it. Our response to the North Korean proposal was consistent with our longstanding focus on denuclearization.

Mr. Obama has pointed to the Iran deal to signal to North Korea that he is open to a similar track with the regime of Kim Jong Un. But the White House sees North Korea as far more opaque and uncooperative. The latest fruitless exchanges typified diplomacy between the U.S. and Pyongyang in recent years.

Since taking power at the end of 2011, Mr. Kim has stepped up the Norths demands for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, 63 years after it ended with an armistice. Many analysts see the move as an attempt to force the removal of the U.S. military in the South. The U.S. insists denuclearization must have priority, and said that has to be part of any peace talks, even while dropping the precondition that North Korea first take steps that show a willingness to give up its nuclear program.

Pyongyang rejects that. For North Korea, winning a peace treaty is the center of the U.S. relationship, said Go Myung-hyun, an expert on North Korea at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul-based think tank. It feels nuclear development gives it a bigger edge to do so.

The international reaction to North Koreas January nuclear test and follow-up rocket launch this month was swift, with Japan imposing new penalties on Pyongyang, South Korea closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had filled the Norths coffers and American lawmakers passing a bill to tighten economic sanctions against the regime. Mr. Obama signed the bill into law last Thursday.

Feeling this sentiment wholeheartedly, 2017 receiver Xavier Jenkins pledged to the Georgia Bulldogs late on Thursday night. A native of Valdosta, Jenkins opted for Kirby Smart's program over offers from East Carolina, Louisville, and Mississippi State.

Jenkins is a long and athletic pass-catching prospect. While he's not (yet) regarded as a top prospect within the state, he possesses a nice upside -- particularly when it comes to making big plays downfield.

The 6-foot-3 receiver is the fifth commitment for Georgia in the class of 2017. Smart and his staff appears primed to reestablish recruiting ties within the state, and essentially put a virtual fence up around the Peach State.

This premise is evidenced by the fact all five pledges currently in the '17 class hail from Georgia.","['prospect', 'georgia', 'talented', 'receiver', 'commitment', 'garners', 'state', 'wholeheartedly', 'way', 'instate', 'jenkins', '2017', 'class', 'xavier']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Hacker group releases information about Cincinnati Police Department employees,[],"Hacking group Anonymous briefly posted online a video detailing the personal information of 52 Cincinnati Police Department employees, including Chief Eliot Isaac, Cincinnati.com reported.

The group said it released the info Sunday night in response to Wednesdays shooting death of Paul Gaston, a black man, by three white Cincinnati cops. By 4:30 a.m. Monday the video had been taken down, according to WLWT.

Thin Blue Line, your game is over, an Anonymous figure said in the video, according to a transcript. You lost. While we release your officers information, we will hold no responsibility of the actions of those that see the information.

That information included names, ages, street addresses, email addresses and social media accounts, as well as the names and addresses of officers family members. Its unclear if the information was obtained via a data breach or through publicly available sources, Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders told Cincinnati.com.

The incident that prompted the Anonymous action involved the somewhat contentious details surrounding Gastons death. While video of the incident shows Gaston initially on his knees with his hands behind his head as cops approach him, police said he reached toward his waistband for what they believed to be a weapon before they shot him. Video evidence appears to back up the officers assertions. After his death, authorities discovered Gaston was carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon.

Anonymous included footage of the shooting  which police had previously released  as part of its video message.

For far too long we have sat idle by letting the gang known as the Thin Blue Line murder citizens of United States without allowing them due process, the video transcript said. Well, we have a message to not only the Cincinnati Police Department but to every law enforcement officer. When you murder a human being when you have other choices of containing your suspect available, we will make your officers information public record.","['hacker', 'information', 'death', 'cincinnati', 'addresses', 'releases', 'employees', 'officers', 'video', 'anonymous', 'department', 'group', 'shooting', 'transcript', 'gaston']"

""Apple would gladly participate in such an effort,"" the company wrote in a post on its website entitled ""Answers to your questions about Apple and security"".

Apple said ""the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands"" to unlock the phone.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking the company's help to access shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's phone by disabling some of its passcode protections.

Farook and Tashfeen Malik attacked a holiday party in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 2, killing 14 people and injuring 22. The pair were killed later in a shootout with police.

Apple argues that while it is technically possible to bypass the security features of the iPhone by building a new operating system, such a move would set a dangerous precedent.

The company said it has not unlocked iPhones for law enforcement in the past but has extracted data from an iPhone running older operating systems under a ""lawful court order.""

The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple to comply with a judge's order to unlock Farook's iPhone.

""We've handed over all the data we have, including a backup of the iPhone in question,"" Apple said in the blog post. ""But now they have asked us for information we simply do not have.""

Representative Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, said last week that the complex issues raised by the Apple case ""will ultimately need to be resolved by Congress, the administration and industry, rather than the courts alone.""

Some victims of the attack will file a legal brief in support of the U.S. government's attempt, a lawyer representing the victims told Reuters on Sunday.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"Trump big winner, Clinton still on shaky ground",['William Whalen'],"How is it possible to have presidential contests in Nevada and South Carolina that are both appealing and appalling to conservatives?

Lets review Saturdays results.

In Nevadas Democratic caucuses, Hillary Clinton struggled for a third consecutive time. As in Iowa and New Hampshire, she blew a double-digit lead (25 points, only a month ago), walking away with what looks like a five-point win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Again, Clinton had difficulty in pumping up her base (she can thank Sen. Harry Reid and a last-minute labor push for getting her over the top). As per usual, she didnt connect with millennial Democrats and voters concerned about her integrity.

Clinton may go on to win the Democratic nomination. On paper, a competition that moves to the South, beginning next Saturday in South Carolina, works to her advantage given the heavily African-American electorates that await her there.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign cant wait to bid adieu to a February in which the candidate hasnt run so much as shes lurched.

Pre-Nevada, Hillarys national lead over Sanders evaporated. Showing none of the certainty of a repeat presidential candidate, Clinton has fiddled with her core message (Im a progressive who likes to get things done) with the same frequency that she changed hairstyles back in the 1990s.

The bottom line: despite winning Nevada, Clintons long-term prospects remain shaky.

And that should elate conservatives.

Now, for the appalling: a Republican primary in South Carolina that had little do with conservative principles, ideas or values.

The complaint here isnt that Donald Trump won. Or, that his dominance again defies common sense: only a single-digit number of South Carolinians told exit pollsters that Trump shares their values; the twice-divorced candidate split the evangelical vote with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

The concern: the nature of how Trump goes about his business  the king of noisy bandwidth, his bombast and calculated fights for months now have dominated news cycles, streamed ceaselessly on social media, and stifled any chance at a calm, rational, issues-driven conversation on the Republican slide.

South Carolina was yet another casualty. The primary was an opportunity to discuss what exactly the conservative movement embodies these days. Now, the moments passed.

To the need to broadening the partys appeal to win national elections, there was a chance to showcase Gov. Nikki Haley (the nations only female Indian-American head of state) and Sen. Tim Scott (one of only two African-American senators).

Both supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dominated the exit-poll electability question. Both played cameos roles compared to the candidates infighting.

South Carolina leads the nation in direct foreign investment and has a veteran population 25 percent larger than the national average. Last year, the state dealt gracefully with three divisive issues: lowering the Confederate flag at the state Capitol; a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston that led to an outpouring of calm, not violence; the fatal police shooting of black man in North Charleston that likewise didnt turn into urban riots.

So where was the conversation regarding growing the economy, the perils of union over-reach (West Virginia, like South Carolina, becoming a right-to-work state this past week), a more coherent foreign policy and a more united society across racial and ideological lines?

The answer: they all were smothered by Trumps antics  and a malady best described as Candidate Derangement Syndrome.

During the course of the GOPs 10-day road trip down south, Trump threatened to sue Cruz over an ad claiming the GOP frontrunner once supported abortion rights. Trump went mano-a-mitre with Pope Francis over building a border wall. He blamed George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks, insinuating that the former president lied his way into the Iraq invasion. Trump even called for a boycott of Apple products so long as the computer refuses to hack into a dead terrorists iPhone.

The media ate it up.

Not surprisingly, the primary played into the stereotype of South Carolina as a political circus.

In fairness, Trumps not the only offender here. Cruz and Rubio spit-balled each other over character flaws, policy inconsistencies and sloppy photo-shopping. Jeb Bush went after Trump in defense of his big brother and in vain hopes of jump-starting a campaign that ended not long after the polls closed.

The question moving forward for conservatives: is this the way its going to be until someone earns 1,237 delegates and the partys nomination?

With three primaries down and another 17 Republican contests to be held over the course of the next two weeks, look for the following dominos to tumble.

Bush. Theres a saying in Silicon Valley: WFIO. It stands for Were F---ed, Its Over.

Credit Jeb Bush with recognizing in an instant that his campaign was over. His concession speech was dignified and without a trace of bitterness  rarities in this age of harsh politics. Other candidates whod spend nearly $81 million in ads ($15 million in South Carolina) with only four delegates to show night not have been so graceful.

Now, the political question: how quickly does Bush throw his organizational and financial weight behind Rubio? Its a good question, as relations between the Floridians are strained, but nowhere near Bushs animosity for Trump.

Rubio. As was the case after his third-place finish in Iowa, opportunity knocks. So how does Rubio capitalize on newfound moment? Look for an infusion of cash and a spate of endorsements. Rubios priorities in the weeks ahead: amassing delegates on March 1 (much easier now that Bush is out of the race), winning Florida on March 15.

Meanwhile, circle this date: Feb. 25. Its the next GOP candidates debate  University of Houston, CNN and Telemundo moderating. And its Rubios next chance to shine as the establishments alternative to Trump and Cruz.

Cruz. Six March 1 states line up as targets for Cruz  Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and his home state of Texas. For Cruz, the goal is to stay close to Trump by winning as many delegates as possible in these winner-takes-most states that allot the delegates proportionally.

The key figure for Cruz and Rubio, presuming Trump continues to run in the low- to mid-30s: 20 percent, which is the threshold required in most states in order to earn delegates.

Trump. Yes, he won. Decisively so.

But as the attention focuses on three candidates, does Trumps share of the pie expand? Trumps support so far: 24.3 percent in Iowa; 35.3 percent in New Hampshire; 33 percent in South Carolina.

For those who see Trump as a media-savvier version of Pat Buchanans insurrection back in 1992, this reminder: Buchanan peaked at 37.5 percent in New Hampshire; he then had trouble cracking 30 percent. The protest movement had a ceiling.

Unlike Buchanans run, Trump is actually winning states. Whether he can get to 40 percent and beyond: its the difference between a race that could be over by Easter Sunday or an unsettled national convention in July.

With the Republican race staying in the South through March 1, perhaps its best to remember a NASCAR adage about the pushing and shoving and fender-bending that occurs along the speedway: rubbings racing.

Thats true in this Republican field, even if the process rubs conservatives the wrong way.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Opinion: At center of U.S.-Cuba relationship is America's core principle of opportunity,['James Williams'],"With the White Houses announcement that President Obama will be visiting Cuba in March, President Obama will become the second sitting American president after Calvin Coolidge to visit Cuba in nine decades. This historic announcement provides the opportunity not only to help define President Obamas legacy, but to also prove that two countries once divided by generations of strife can come together through diplomacy to support the American and Cuban people.

There is ample room for American businesses across all sectors to gain a foothold in the Cuban market, especially in agriculture. Cuba imports 80 percent of its food from far away countries such as Brazil and Argentina. - James Williams

President Obamas visit comes at a pivotal moment for our country. At a time of heightened political divisiveness in and out of Washington on nearly every issue, support for a new Cuba policy cuts through tired party politics. Seventy-two percent of Americans from both parties agree that its time for Congress to end the embargo and open the U.S. up for business and travel with our Cuban neighbors. The Cuban people overwhelmingly support this as well, as 97 percent of them favor ending the embargo.

This agreement among Americans on both sides of the aisle, and in rural areas and cities alike, is why we launched Engage Cuba, a bipartisan coalition dedicated to ending the Cuban travel and trade embargo. We work with local community leaders and business people from across the country who can envision a future with renewed U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations and can see the increased economic activity that comes with it. It is amazing to see bipartisan leaders across diverse sectors in states such as Tennessee and Ohio come together through Engage Cuba State Councils to stand united in their support for ending the Cuban embargo, and because of the possibilities ahead, that support will only continue to grow.

Renewed U.S.-Cuba relations is appealing to Americans because at the center of this burgeoning relationship is the core American principle of opportunity. Engagement with Cuba presents numerous prospects for U.S. businesses and the Cuban people. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, trade with Cuba could generate $4.3 billion in American exports.

There is ample room for American businesses across all sectors to gain a foothold in the Cuban market, especially in agriculture. Cuba imports 80 percent of its food from far away countries such as Brazil and Argentina. But if the embargo were to be lifted, Cubans could instead import fresh and nutritious food from its close neighbor, the United States, and American farmers could bring their products to a largely untapped market while delivering quality, affordable food to the Cuban people.

This is just one of the many economic opportunities President Obama will witness when he visits Cuba. With the need for infrastructure investment, telecommunications expansion and so much more, each day the U.S. cannot trade with Cuba is a missed opportunity. The current embargo halts job growth and economic development in places that need it most  both in Cuba and here in America. But these changes are not solely the responsibility of the U.S. In order to build on this diplomatic moment, Cuba has to do its part to continue to open its economy and support greater economic ties with the United States.

As the President embarks on his first visit to Cuba, and opens up additional possibilities to engage with Cuba in the future, he is continuing the significant progress made over the last year. Just recently, the U.S. and Cuba reached an agreement to commence commercial flights for the first time in 50 years. In a short time, millions of Americans will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and soak in its rich and vibrant culture. And just this week, U.S. and Cuban trade officials met to discuss additional regulatory changes that can be made to support trade and commerce.

So we should celebrate President Obamas trip to Cuba as a historic moment, one that seeks to put an end to the conflict and tension that defined the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba for decades. After years of a failed policy, it is time for our country to engage with Cuba and ensure our foreign policy encourages opportunity that is good for both Americans and Cubans.

James Williams is the President of Engage Cuba, the leading coalition of private companies and organizations working to end the travel and trade embargo on Cuba.

To fight the threats which it faces, Turkey has the right to launch any kind of operation, in Syria and wherever else the terrorist organizations are located, Erdogan said in a speech on Saturday, according to a Dogan news agency report cited by AFP.

Turkey and Russia each back opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, with Russia aiding embattled President Bashar Assad and Turkey supporting rebel groups which seek to topple him. The immediate targets of Turkeys military might are Syrian Kurdish fighters, some of whom have benefitted from Russian airstrikes in Syria.

The situation we are currently facing is one of legitimate defense,"" - President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

Turkey has blamed the Kurdish fighters for, among other attacks, a deadly car bombing this week that killed 28. Turkey fears the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey considers terrorists, could create a significant base along the countrys southern border. In an attempt to prevent those groups from controlling a large swath of territory, Turkey has already been shelling targets in Syria, drawing the ire of the Russians. Russia views the shelling as an affront to Syrian sovereignty, as evidenced by a since-rejected proposed UN resolution demanding an end to the shelling, Reuters reported.

French President Francois Hollande said Friday that Turkeys expanding use of force in Syria could risk a war with Russia.

Turkey is involved in Syria...There, there is a risk of war, Hollande told France Inter radio in an interview cited by AFP.

Also on Friday, Barack Obama urged Erdogan to show reciprocal restraint with the Kurdish fighters, according to AFP.

But Erdogan appears to be rejecting the calls to caution.

The situation we are currently facing is one of legitimate defense, Erdogan said Saturday. No one can deny or limit Turkeys legitimate right to defense in the face of terrorist attacks.","['turkey', 'kurdish', 'right', 'turkeys', 'launch', 'terrorist', 'shelling', 'strikes', 'fighters', 'erdogan', 'president', 'syria', 'syrian']"

Beasley is scheduled to begin chemotherapy treatments this week in Arizona.

''In a perfect world the chemo knocks it out, dissolves it,'' Beasley said Sunday, when he joined the Rangers two days after his cancer was revealed. ''Then we have to think about the option if I want to do the surgery or not. I know the doctors will want to do it regardless.''

The plan is for at least four chemotherapy treatments every two weeks. Doctors have told the 49-year-old coach there could be periods of fatigue after treatments.

Beasley said he had been dealing with hemorrhoids since August and when they did not subside, he opted to check it out further with a colonoscopy. He said doctors then discovered a mass, but felt good about catching it in time. He said everything is contained.

''I walk by faith, not by sight. I'm a Christian man, a strong man of faith. My belief through my faith in God I'm already delivered from this,'' he said. ''I've just got to go through the process.''

The Rangers have said they will see how Beasley feels before determining if they need someone to fill in for the coach on an interim basis. Beasley got to camp after missing the initial workout Friday following the reporting date for pitchers and catchers.

General manager Jon Daniels and manager Jeff Banister, Beasley's friend for about 25 years, have told Beasley to work at whatever pace he needs to during camp.

Texas has its first full-squad workout scheduled for Wednesday, and start playing games a week later.

''It's a good outlet mentally,'' Beasley said. ''I could have easily done this at home, but at home I felt I'd have too much downtime in between treatments. Half of this battle is mentally, keeping my mind occupied and not sitting around thinking, allowing possibilities and scenarios creep into your mind. I don't want to do that. Here I'll be busy every day. There's so much to keep my mind occupied here, so this is good therapy for me.''

Beasley was getting treatment at a cancer center in Houston before joining the Rangers in camp. He said his top priority is getting healthy and to the point of being able to be consistent without any limitations or restrictions again.

''You have an opportunity to look at things in life in two ways, obstacle or opportunity,'' Beasley said. ''I could look at this as an obstacle and be defeated by it. But I choose to look at this is an opportunity.''","['faith', 'good', 'calls', 'cancer', 'camp', 'mind', 'treatments', 'rangers', 'coach', 'therapy', 'doctors', 'beasley', 'opportunity', 'look']"

The United States will play Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay in what appears to be a difficult first-round group in the Centennial Copa America.

In the opener of a special 16-nation tournament whose business deals led to indictments against a slew of top soccer executives on corruption charges, the Americans play the Colombians on June 3 at Santa Clara, California. The U.S. meets regional rival Costa Rica four days later at Chicago, then closes Group A play against Paraguay at Philadelphia on June 11.

To U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, the daunting group that emerged from Sunday night's draw at the Manhattan Center reminds him of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where the U.S. opened with a 2-1 win over Ghana, tied Portugal 2-2 and lost to Germany 1-0, good enough to finish second. The Americans were eliminated with a 2-1 extra-time loss to Belgium in the round of 16.

""It's doable. We had a similar kind of scenario in Brazil, and we went through,"" Klinsmann said. ""First or second with that group is both tremendously fine.""

Other groups are:

Group B: Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti, Peru

Group C: Jamaica, Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela

Group D: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Panama

Colombia went 3-0 in its group at the World Cup and was knocked out by Brazil in the quarterfinals. Ranked eighth in the world, Colombia has a player pool that includes stars James Rodriguez and Jackson Martinez.

""We know we start right on our toes with the opening whistle in Santa Clara,"" Klinsmann said.

In a famous match during the group stage of the 1994 World Cup, the U.S. upset the Colombians 2-1 at the Rose Bowl, a result that led 10 days later to the murder of Andres Escobar, a 27-year-old Colombian defender who had deflected a pass from John Harkes into his net for an own goal.

Two years ago, Colombia beat the U.S. 2-1 in an exhibition in London.

""One of the toughest groups because of the history of all the teams involved,"" Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said.

Costa Rica is ranked 31st, second in the North and Central America and Caribbean region behind Mexico, which is 22nd. The U.S. is 32nd, and Paraguay is 42nd.

The top two teams in each of four groups advance to the quarterfinals of the tournament, which will be played at 10 U.S. venues from June 3-26. The semifinals are in Houston and Chicago, and the championship is at East Rutherford, New Jersey.

If the U.S. tops its group, it would play the second-place team from Group B at Seattle. If the Americans finish second, they would play the Group B winner at East Rutherford.

""We have to learn how to win knockout games,"" Klinsmann said. ""No better way to start it than a Copa America.""

Argentina's Lionel Messi, a five-time world player of the year, already has committed to playing in the tournament. Organizers also hope it will include top stars such as Brazil's Neymar, Uruguay's Luis Suarez and Chile's Alexis Sanchez.

""This will give the game again a huge boost in the United States,"" Klinsmann said.

The U.S. is coming off a mediocre 2015, when it was eliminated by Jamaica in the semifinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. That forced the Americans into a playoff for a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup, a match they lost to Mexico.

The tournament was planned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Copa America, South America's championship, and federal prosecutors alleged a company formed to buy the Centennial Copa America's marketing rights agreed to pay $110 million in bribes to South American soccer officials.

The last three presidents of soccer's governing bodies for South America and the CONCACAF region have been indicted, including former CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb, who agreed to plead guilty. The corruption probe led FIFA President Sepp Blatter to announce his resignation last spring, just days after he was elected to a fifth term. His successor is due to be chosen Friday by a special FIFA Congress.

Following the initial indictments in May, the U.S. Soccer Federation refused to host the tournament until the previous business agreements were terminated.

While many factors that may contribute to high cholesterol are well known, many cardiologists say stress goes overlooked and unmentioned, but chronic stress from a tough job or a strained relationship can play a role, along with poor diet, smoking, and lack of exercise in causing lipid concentrations to rise.

65-year-old Chris was taking medication and working on his diet when his cholesterol shot up anyway. His doctor suggested he get rid of some of the stress in life, which meant scaling down some responsibilities at his job that saw him regularly traveling internationally...

He listened to the doctor and four years later his level of so-called bad cholesterol has dropped to 62mg per deciliter from 121.

Understanding the effect of stress on cholesterol is becoming more important as peoples lives increasingly are crammed with obligations and digital technology, making it harder than ever to tune out.

Navarro was arrested in Okinawa on Sunday evening, national broadcaster NHK reported.

Its a long journey from Manhattan to Los Angeles without burning any fossil fuels, so hopefully Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo started walking several weeks ago.

Ruffalo  nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Spotlight  is one of Hollywoods most outspoken environmental activists. Over the past few decades, he appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies before earning fame as Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk in the Avengers movie series. Perhaps playing a character with two different personas has taught him how to lead the double-standard life of a typical Hollywood environmental hypocrite; one day, youre flying to award ceremonies and making energy-guzzling action movies, the next day youre raging against the very industries and technologies that make your comfortable lifestyle possible.","['technologies', 'supporting', 'walking', 'weeks', 'hypocrisy', 'academy', 'youre', 'ruffalo', 'award', 'mark', 'environmental', 'taught', 'goes', 'hollywood', 'day', 'typical']"

Using NASA open data, Ordnance Survey, the U.K.'s national mapping agency, has surveyed part of the red planets surface to create a one-off paper and digital map. The 2,282-by-1,691-mile Mars map, produced at a scale of 1 to 4 million, is part of an OS effort to assess potential use of its mapping expertise for future Mars missions.

Becoming more familiar with space is something that interests us all and the opportunity to apply our innovative cartography and mapping tradecraft to a different planet was something we couldnt resist, explained OS Director of Products David Henderson, in a press release. We were asked to map an area of Mars in an OS style because our maps are easy to understand and present a compelling visualization, and because of this we can envisage their usefulness in planning missions and for presenting information about missions to the public.

OS, which was created for military purposes in 1791, has 500 million unique geographic features of Great Britain in its database. The last time the agency created a map outside of Britains shores was in the mid-1990s.

We have set out from the start to treat the Mars data no different to how we would treat OS GB data or any other Earth-based geography, said OS Cartographic Design Consultant Chris Wesson, who designed the map. The cartographic style is something that is very different to your typical planetary map and is identifiable as an OS map. The key ingredients to this style are the soft color palette of the base combined with the traditional map features such as contours and grid lines, and the map sheet layout complete with legend.

NASA has a 2035 target for landing humans on Mars, although Elon Musk, CEO of private space company SpaceX, has predicted that people could be on Mars within 8 to 10 years. In December Musk said that SpaceXs audacious vertical rocket landing lays a critical foundation for reusable rockets that could help humans colonize Mars.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Russia wants to fly surveillance planes over US with advanced cameras, congressional staffer says",[],"Russia will ask permission on Monday to start flying surveillance planes equipped with high-powered digital cameras amid warnings from U.S. intelligence and military officials that such overflights help Moscow collect intelligence on the United States.

Russia and the United States are signatories to the Open Skies Treaty, which allows unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of all 34 member nations to foster transparency about military activity and help monitor arms control and other agreements. Senior intelligence and military officials, however, worry that Russia is taking advantage of technological advances to violate the spirit of the treaty.

Russia will formally ask the Open Skies Consultative Commission, based in Vienna, to be allowed to fly an aircraft equipped with high-tech sensors over the United States, according to a senior congressional staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the staff member wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

The request will put the Obama administration in the position of having to decide whether to let Russia use the high-powered equipment on its surveillance planes at a time when Moscow, according to the latest State Department compliance report, is failing to meet all its obligations under the treaty. And it comes at one of the most tension-filled times in U.S.-Russia relations since the end of the Cold War, with the two countries at odds over Russian activity in Ukraine and Syria.

""The treaty has become a critical component of Russia's intelligence collection capability directed at the United States,"" Adm. Cecil D. Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, wrote in a letter earlier this year to Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of a House subcommittee on strategic forces.

""In addition to overflying military installations, Russian Open Skies flights can overfly and collect on Department of Defense and national security or national critical infrastructure,"" Haney said. ""The vulnerability exposed by exploitation of this data and costs of mitigation are increasingly difficult to characterize.""

A State Department official said Sunday that treaty nations had not yet received notice of the Russian request, but that certification of the Russian plane with a ""digital electro-optical sensor"" could not occur until this summer because the treaty requires a 120-day advance notification. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

The official also said that the treaty, which was entered into force in 2002, establishes procedures for certifying digital sensors to confirm that they are compliant with treaty requirements. The official said all signatories to the treaty agree that ""transition from film cameras to digital sensors is required for the long-term viability of the treaty.""

In December, Rose Gottemoeller, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, sought to temper concerns about Russian overflights, saying that what Moscow gains from the observation flights is ""incremental"" to what they collect through other means.

""One of the advantages of the Open Skies Treaty is that information  imagery  that is taken is shared openly among all the treaty parties,"" she said at a joint hearing of the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees in December. ""So one of the advantages with the Open Skies Treaty is that we know exactly what the Russians are imaging, because they must share the imagery with us.""

Still, military and intelligence officials have expressed serious concern.

""The open skies construct was designed for a different era,"" Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers when asked about the Russian overflights during a congressional hearing. ""I'm very concerned about how it's applied today.""

Robert Work, deputy secretary of defense, told Congress: ""We think that they're going beyond the original intent of the treaty and we continue to look at this very, very closely.""

Steve Rademaker, former assistant secretary of state for the bureau of arms control and the bureau of international security and nonproliferation, told Congress at a hearing on security cooperation in Europe in October that Russia complies with the Open Skies Treaty, but has ""adopted a number of measures that are inconsistent with the spirit"" of the accord.

The treaty, for instance, obligates each member to make all of its territory available for aerial observation, yet Russia has imposed restrictions on surveillance over Moscow and Chechnya and near Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he said. Russian restrictions also make it hard to conduct observation in the Kaliningrad enclave, said Rademaker, who believes Russia is ""selectively implementing"" the treaty ""in a way that suits its interests.""","['wants', 'fly', 'united', 'intelligence', 'cameras', 'surveillance', 'state', 'staffer', 'advanced', 'planes', 'russian', 'military', 'security', 'treaty', 'open', 'russia', 'congressional', 'skies']"
foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,It's a miracle! Hollywood finally tells a great Bible story,['Todd Starnes'],"Lets be honest. Hollywood does not exactly have the best track record when it comes to producing accurate faith-based movies. Remember the giant rock creatures from Noah?

So when I heard that Sony Pictures was about to release a faith-based film called Risen, I was a bit skeptical. Typically faith-based movies are faith-bashing movies.

Click here to get Todds American Dispatch  a must-read for conservatives.

And when Risen earned three-and-a-half stars from the left wingers at the Seattle Times, I was incredulous.

But when I saw the films trailer, I was astonished  Hollywood got it right.

Risen is a powerful telling of the aftermath of the resurrection of Jesus told from the perspective of a non-believer  a Roman military officer.

Joseph Fiennes plays Clavius, assigned to investigate the disappearance of Jesus body. Its like an old school detective noir story  think C.S.I. Jerusalem.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds interview with Risen star Joseph Fiennes.

Its a movie that sees the resurrection through the eyes of a non-believer,"" Fiennes told me. Its a wonderful, fresh way in seeing the story of Christ unfold through the eyes of a skeptic.

Fiennes is well aware of Hollywoods past attempts to bring Bible stories to the big screen. Anybody choke on their popcorn during Noah and Exodus: God and Kings?

The ever-diplomatic Fiennes did not name names, but he did refer to revisionist films that polarized a lot of people. On the other hand there are the cinephiles who took issue with preachy and conservative and low production value Christian films that did not speak to them.

Thats why Affirm Films and Sony Pictures went the extra mile to make sure they got Risen right.

We strived very hard in getting the balance between cinema and Scripture, Fiennes said. Working with the church communities in the process of making the film has allowed us to stay as true as possible to Scripture.

At the same time, they were also tasked with producing a solid work of art.

Its a film and we want people to have a great cinematic experience, Fiennes told me.

In other words  its a night at the movies  not a Sunday morning church service.

We are not selling religion or pushing religion, he said. We are pushing for great cinema and great story telling and I believe we got the balance right.

And so do many evangelical Christian leaders  most notably revered media critic Ted Baehr, chairman of the Christian Film and Television Commission.

It is a very powerful dramatic movie, Baehr said in a video posted on his website. Its a powerful heart-rending story. I recommend it for every Christian to take their friends to see Risen.

The film was also endorsed by a group of prominent Christian leaders and ministers.

Its a movie that makes you think, said Chris Williamson, pastor of Strong Tower Bible Church. Its not your typical Christian-themed movie  even though its dominated with Christian themes. If you are an atheist, a new believer, an unbeliever  I think you can find yourself in this film.

Renowned Christian leader Rick White attended a screening of the film in Tennessee. He said the film demonstrates that its okay to ask the hard questions on your spiritual journey.

Mr. Fiennes and Affirm Films and Sony Pictures have demonstrated a deep respect for the Christian faith. And in doing, so they have produced a film that will encourage and challenge and entertain a very diverse audience.

So as a fellow believer, Id like to share these words with Sony Pictures --- thank you.

He is Risen. He is Risen Indeed!

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Human rights group says 'limited access' has hindered probe of missing Mexican students,[],"While bloody death tolls and ubiquitous violence are nothing new in a country that has seen an estimated 106,000 people killed in drug violence since 2006, the disappearance of 43 college students has shaken the country and spurred widespread protests across Mexico.

Human rights experts say that they have run into serious obstacles in their investigation into the case of 43 college students who went missing after being detained by police in southern Mexico in 2014.

International experts for the Inter-American Human Rights Commission said Sunday at a news conference that they were concerned about being given limited access to new information uncovered by government investigators and they criticized leaks of statements from some of those arrested in the case that the panel said ""don't correspond to the truth.""

They also said authorities had not allowed them be present for statements by military personnel who were witnesses of the disappearance or been given access to videos that could clarify what happened that night.

Later Sunday, the federal Attorney General's Office issued a statement reaffirming its willingness to work with the expert panel and saying it already is investigating the leaks. It denied that officials have fragmented findings from the government's investigation, which it said remains open.

In their first report in September, the expert panel rejected the official version of the government that after being killed, the students' bodies were incinerated at a dump. The panel charged at that time that some Mexican authorities had obstructed justice in the case.

The students from a local teachers college have not been seen since Sept. 26, 2014, when they were detained after clashing with municipal police in the city of Iguala in Guerrero state. Six other people were killed during the clashes, including some not involved in the confrontation.

Government prosecutors have said the police turned the students over to a local drug gang, which killed them and burned their bodies.

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,U.S. scientists say link between Zika and Microcephaly needs more research,[],"Scientists suspect an outbreak of the Zika virus is behind a surge in a rare birth defect in Brazil. But how are they going to prove it?

Authorities in the South American country were quick to make the link last fall. The health minister last week said he was ""absolutely sure"" that the mosquito-borne virus is a cause.

But others aren't so certain. While the evidence has been mounting, so far it is circumstantial.

""The simple presence of the virus doesn't mean it caused the birth defect. It means there's a probability,"" said Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan epidemiologist.

The investigation is still in its early stages. It began after Brazilian doctors noticed an increase last fall in babies with a birth defect called microcephaly, which has a number of causes. The cases closely followed the country's first outbreak of the tropical virus Zika, which was thought to cause no more than a mild illness that clears up in a week.

Microcephaly hadn't been seen in past Zika outbreaks. Babies with the condition have a smaller than normal head and often have a smaller brain that hasn't developed properly. Lab tests have detected the virus in the brain tissue of a few babies with microcephaly.

Proving the cause is a bit like prosecuting a murder investigation, with Zika as the apparent killer but a lot of unanswered questions, said Dr. Ernesto Marques, a University of Pittsburgh microbiologist who is collaborating with Brazilian researchers.

""What you have so far, the victim is there, and you find a person right there that has a smoking gun in his hand,"" Marques said. ""But you still need to close the deal.""

The investigation poses special challenges. There's currently no good animal substitute for humans to study the virus. And it's not considered ethical to infect people, especially pregnant women, in an experiment to see what happens  not when there seems to be a real chance that a volunteer could be seriously harmed.

So researchers are turning to other kinds of studies to try to establish whether Zika or some other factor is causing the birth defect or, also, a paralyzing condition called Guillain-Barre. Five Latin America countries with Zika outbreaks are reporting an uptick in that condition in adults.

One method is quick-and-dirty research called a case-control study, which looks back in time after an illness or condition has occurred. For the birth defect research, that means recruiting a group of women with babies born with microcephaly and trying to sort out what may have happened during their pregnancy to spark the condition. For comparison, they will query women whose infants don't have the birth defect.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is involved in one such a study set to start next week in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. It will focus on 100 babies with microcephaly and at least 200 more without.

Investigators will take blood samples from the mothers to check for signs of an earlier Zika infection. They also will ask not only about Zika infections but other possible factors, like other germs or poisons in the environment. Some experts suggest that perhaps Zika needs an accomplice  like malnutrition or an infection with another tropical illness like dengue  to cause serious problems.

The CDC was in the coastal city of Salvador last month to help health officials with another look-back study, this one targeting Guillain-Barre. They tested 40 people who had the condition, and 80 people who didn't, said Dr. James Sejvar, who led the CDC team.

But such studies are hardly perfect. People often have trouble remembering every detail from six months ago  for example, when they might have been bitten by mosquitoes, the primary source of Zika infections.

Researchers say it's important to also do studies that follow people forward in time.

A large example: Colombia will be following 2,000 Zika-infected pregnant women to see what happens with them and their pregnancies, according to Dr. Marcos Espinal of the Pan American Health Organization.

In the Recife metropolitan area, Brazilian scientists will examine 200 babies with microcephaly and about 400 without, at two points in time, spaced 28 days apart.

""That will be the first one to tell us if there's strong evidence"" of Zika as a causal link, Espinal told reporters Thursday.

Espinal said results could come as early as April. But Marques  who is one of the study's researchers  said significant results could take until late summer.

In Brazil, Zika's possible link to microcephaly emerged in September, when a spike in babies born with the condition got the attention of Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, a pediatric neurologist at a hospital in northeast Recife that works with disabled children.

Initially, Van der Linden and other doctors looked for the usual causes of microcephaly, such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, HIV, and cytomegalovirus. None were found.

But most of the mothers had something in common: blotches and skin rashes early in their pregnancies that seemed consistent with Zika. That was the genesis of the link.

It's all been difficult to sort out, though, because Brazil wasn't keeping good track of microcephaly cases before Zika arrived. They're still determining how many of the reported cases are really microcephaly and involve a Zika infection.

One of the puzzling questions facing researchers: Why have so many severe health problems been reported in Brazil, but comparatively few in other Latin America or Caribbean countries with Zika? Will we soon see similar spikes elsewhere, or is the Brazilian setting somehow unique?

Health officials are closely watching Colombia, which had a Zika outbreak after Brazil and so far has not seen a spike in microcephaly cases. If there is, it would be apparent by June and would help finger Zika as the culprit, Espinal said.

It will take a combination of studies and laboratory evidence to finally determine if Zika is the villain it appears to be, experts say.

""This is going to be solved,"" said Dr. Farrah Mateen, a Harvard researcher. ""It's just a matter of doing the research in the right way.""

The poster is part of a Black History Month exhibit at the Central Islip courthouse on Long Island. But three retired NYPD officers told CBS2 New York last week that the drawing doesnt belong in a courthouse. One referred to it as hate speech.

Black Lives Matter we feel is anti-police and the rhetoric that they spew is anti-police and weve actually had them on video walking the streets of New York City calling for the death of police officers, retired NYPD officer and Internet radio host Ed Munoz told the station. So for it to be hanging in a courtroom, we find outrageous.

The drawing reads: Stop The Violence. Black Lives Matter. Stop the Racism.

The verdict on the poster with courthouse visitors was split, the station reported.

I think its highly political and controversial, one said.

Another said, I dont think its anti-cop, its just awareness of whats going on in society today.

State judge C. Randall Hinrichs, who oversees the courts in Suffolk County, told CBS2 there are no plans to remove the poster.

It is not the intention of the court to put forth any anti-law enforcement message, he told the station. This is the cultural response of a middle school student, here in Central Islip, to present-day America.

Hinrichs said the last thing they want to do is offend law enforcement.

It talks about stopping violence and racism, which are admirable sentiments, and I know its interpreted by different people, different ways, he said.","['retired', 'courthouse', 'ignites', 'students', 'poster', 'violence', 'controversy', 'matter', 'station', 'lives', 'york', 'black', 'told']"

A new study shows the moon is likely to break apart before it hits the atmosphere, creating a debris ring that will encircle Mars for millions of years.

The research, published in this weeks Nature Geoscience, follows a report earlier this month that not only is Phobos losing altitude due to Mars gravity, it also already is showing signs of structurally stress from tidal forces.

NEWS: Mars Moon Phobos Is Double-Doomed

Phobos survived a giant impact early in its history, but damage from the crash left the moon weak, say Benjamin Black and Tushar Mittal, planetary scientists with University of California at Berkeley.

Their study shows that in 20 million to 40 million years, Phobos will break apart, leaving a cloud of debris that will relatively quickly assembly into a ring around Mars.

Initially, the ring will be as dense as Saturns rings today, and it will last for up to 100 million years, the study shows.

For Earthlings, Phobos demise presents a unique opportunity to study what may be the solar systems last inwardly migrating moon.

Gratuitous. Nasty. Petty. Spiteful. Insulting. Just plain rude. When the rhetoric of a major partys leading presidential candidate falls to this level, we should be scornful.

So, how is it OK when it isnt just a presidential candidate, but a president, who does it?

Donald Trumps policy of demeaning and snarking his political opponents has been a favorite habit of President Obama for the last eight years. Obama is perhaps the first president who believes that leading the country and playing to the beliefs of the extremists in his own party amount to the same thing, and like Trump fans, Obama fans are motivated in large degree by sheer hatred.

They love to hear their idol channel their rage by bashing people they dont like.

Obamas latest, silent insult  leaving a spokesman to explain he had better things to do on a Saturday than attend the funeral of a 30-year justice of the Supreme Court  isnt surprising when you consider the mean-spirited things he says virtually every time he steps in front of a microphone.

This week Obama spokesman Josh Earnest bashed Sen. Chuck Schumer, who objected to cuts in counterterrorism funding for New York. Earnest said, in essence, why listen to this fool on anything if he opposed the Iran deal, especially since most Democrats were in favor?

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, accurately, that this was pure politics  the president was punishing New York to get back at Schumer.","['hits', 'fans', 'things', 'isnt', 'heights', 'spokesman', 'schumer', 'york', 'rudeness', 'scalia', 'president', 'obamas', 'presidential', 'leading', 'obama']"
foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Google this: Israeli scientists eye $20M moon race prize,['James Rogers'],"Israeli scientists are confident that their SpaceIL spacecraft will clinch the $20 million Google Lunar XPRIZE to land an unmanned probe on the moon by the end of next year.

SpaceIL is one of the leading contenders among the 16 teams vying for the Lunar XPRIZE. The competition offers a $20 million prize to the first privately-funded team to land a rover on the moon by the end of 2017.

After landing on the moon, the craft must move 1,640 feet across the lunar surface and send high-definition pictures (including a selfie) and video back to Earth. The second team to successfully complete the mission will be awarded $5 million. Teams, however, must prove that 90 percent of their mission costs were funded by private sources.

Last year SpaceIL announced that it had signed a launch contract with SpaceX, securing a ticket to the moon on a Falcon 9 rocket. The Israeli team's launch is scheduled for the second half of 2017.

Related: Digital Mars map shows contours, legend

Rival team Moon Express announced a contract with Rocket Lab last year to launch three robotic spacecraft to land on the Moon starting in 2017.

In order to reduce the cost of the mission, SpaceIL will share its SpaceX ride with a number of satellites. SpaceX will start by releasing the satellites that will orbit the Earth first, we stay on the rocket last  they then ignite their engine and give us an extra boost, SpaceIL co-founder Yonatan Winetraub told FoxNews.com.

After separating from the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceIL will undertake the final stage of its journey to the moon, a trip that will take significantly longer than NASAs Apollo missions of the '60s and '70s.

Winetraub, a doctoral student in biophysics at Stanford, explained that on a direct trajectory, such as those used by the Apollo missions, it usually takes three days to get to the moon. However, SpaceILs craft is expected to take a couple of months to reach its destination after separating from the rocket. Because the Falcon 9s trajectory is not purely determined by the SpaceIL moon mission, SpaceIL will need to do more maneuvering in space to get the spacecraft to the moon, he said. We will carefully time SpaceILs engines burns to space to specific locations and for specific durations.

Then, of course, the spacecraft has to complete a tricky moon landing.

Landing is the most difficult part of the mission for multiple reasons, said Winetraub, noting that SpaceIL will control its own landing, removing the risk of delayed messages from mission control. It takes radio signals traveling at the speed of light 2 to 3 seconds in total to send and receive messages  the spacecraft is traveling at 2 kilometers a second at that point.

Instead, SpaceIL will use a sophisticated accelerometer and gyrometer called an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to help control its descent, a sensor that measures distance to the moon, and a Star Tracker device that uses stars for navigation. Its an advanced version of using the North Star for navigation, said Winetraub.

So, how will SpaceIL avoid the fate of the Philae lander, which made history when it landed on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014, but then bounced twice, leaving scientists uncertain about its exact location. After touching down in the correct location, the probes first bounce lasted 2 hours and took the craft up to a distance of more than half a mile. The second bounce was a small jump of just over an inch per second for 7 minutes, according to scientists.

[Philae] was a completely different problem  the moons gravity is significantly stronger ... the Moons geometry is very well understood  we have got a good idea of where we will land, said Winetraub. Were doing our best  it is rocket science!

After landing on the moon, SpaceIL must then complete its video and picture tasks, as well as undertaking its short journey over the lunar surface.

Were going to do it in a single hop  were going to reignite the engines, do a little launch and land again, 500 meters [1,600 feet] to the side, said Winetraub.

SpaceIL will also conduct scientific experiments in conjunction with Israels prestigious Weizmann Institute to measure the lunar magnetic field. Its additional data on top of what the Apollo missions did, said the SpaceIL co-founder.

The spacecraft will use solar panels and a battery for power while on the moon. We plan [to operate it] for a few days, but it might be longer, said Winetraub. Were trying to land on the lunar sunrise  we need the place to be lit so that we have energy to power our solar panels; we need to be able to see the land and its cooler [during the sunrise], as opposed to when the sun is fully up.

The scientist, who researched Martian colonies at NASAs International Space University, hopes that the eventual success of SpaceIL will inspire young people. We want to put the spotlight back on science because its very important for the economy of Israel and the U.S. that kids will want to become engineers and scientists and one day, they could make breakthroughs of their own, he told FoxNews.com. We use the spaceship as a source for them to identify and choose science as careers.

SpaceIL partners include Israel Aerospace Industries, telecommunications company Bezeq, Tel Aviv University and the Technion  Israel Institute of Technology. Israel is a small country that has extreme innovation, said Winetraub.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,USMNT dust off Brazil blueprint after tough Copa America Centenario draw,[],"NEW YORK --

Visions of Brazil emerged as the Copa America Centenario draw unfolded. United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann knew this feeling all too well after the trials and tribulations two years ago. One by one, the complications emerged. The verdict at the end proved inescapable: the U.S. once again ended up in the most difficult group in the tournament.

There is no masking the perilous road ahead with Colombia (June 3 in Santa, Clara, Calif.), Costa Rica (June 7 in Chicago) and Paraguay (June 11 in Philadelphia) now placed on the Group A docket. This daunting group tracked closely to the worst-case scenario, particularly with Brazil looming as the likely opposition for the second-place finisher. The burden falls on the U.S. to overcome those twists and turns to emerge from group play once again.

""Obviously, it's a difficult group, no doubt about it,"" Klinsmann said. ""But it's doable. We had a similar scenario in Brazil and we went through. Now we start with Colombia right away instead of Ghana.""

The experiences in Brazil provide a blueprint for the challenges ahead, but this particular situation carries its own pitfalls. There is considerable pressure on Klinsmann and his players to advance from group play in the most significant men's soccer tournament held on American soil since the 1994 World Cup. There are no excuses for an early exit at home, even with the difficult nature of the group. Failure simply is not an option.

Klinsmann reinforced the steadfast nature of those expectations even with this assignment and reiterated the need to focus at every turn. The path forged in the last World Cup included a victory over Ghana in the first game and a draw in the second match against Portugal points the way here. Those successes illustrated the utility of a positive start and underscored the need to attack the proceedings in piecemeal fashion.

""We take it one at a time,"" Klinsmann said. ""We'll do everything we can to prepare very, very thoroughly for Colombia. Now it's good to have the teams. We can reach out, put the scouting plans together for all of their strengths, weaknesses and their individual players. We can get our homework done and prepare the guys 100 percent for the job.""

Those exercises require caution and diligence given the fluid nature of the South American opposition. Klinsmann expects Colombia and Paraguay to bring their top players to the tournament this summer, but there are some difficult decisions ahead for both nations as they devise their plans.

Colombia must contemplate potential alterations if the under-23 side defeats the Americans in the two-legged Olympic playoff next month. Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez -- like several of his European-based compatriots -- isn't expected to play in both tournaments. Paraguay are more concerned with World Cup qualifying and manager Ramon Diaz is already laying the groundwork for a potentially weakened outfit.

Both countries plan to work through those permutations in the months ahead. Similar sentiments apply to Klinsmann and the Americans as they dispense with World Cup qualifying obligations against Guatemala next month and sort through selection issues ahead of the tournament.

There are several quandaries for Klinsmann to weigh over the next few months as the tournament comes into focus. The exploits of German-based trio John Brooks, Christian Pulisic and Bobby Wood, the recent demotions of goalkeepers Brad Guzan and Tim Howard and the role ahead for longtime fixture Clint Dempsey all warrant consideration. The balance of the side and the mixture between youth and experience also play a critical part in the calculus as the American squad takes shape.

Expect Klinsmann to use the pair of competitive matches against Guatemala and the expected pre-tournament buildup in May to sift through those finer points. Those decisions carry additional weight now given the magnitude of the task ahead as players jostle for places.

""It will help us also in terms of World Cup qualifying,"" Klinsmann said. ""Both Guatemala games are big, big games competitively within the group to make your case, make your statement towards the Copa America. This helps us now.""

Every little bit helps as the Americans set their sights on a place in the knockout stage. The difficulty of the road ahead is clear now. The tournament is laid out with all of the pitfalls in place and all of the potential rewards on display. The way forward now is familiar. It is now just a matter of conjuring up the application and the defiance of two years ago to guarantee safe passage later this year.","['brazil', 'blueprint', 'draw', 'copa', 'tough', 'ahead', 'cup', 'tournament', 'play', 'usmnt', 'klinsmann', 'players', 'centenario', 'colombia', 'world', 'dust', 'group', 'america', 'difficult']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Common software would have allowed FBI to unlock San Bernardino shooter's phone,[],"The county government that owned the iPhone in a high-profile legal battle between Apple Inc. and the Justice Department paid for but never installed a feature that would have allowed the FBI to easily and immediately unlock the phone as part of the terrorism investigation into the shootings that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.



If the technology, known as mobile device management, had been installed, San Bernardino officials would have been able to remotely unlock the iPhone for the FBI without the theatrics of a court battle that is now pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns.



The service costs $4 per month per phone.



Instead, the only person who knew the unlocking passcode for the phone is the dead gunman, Syed Farook, who worked as an inspector in the county's public health department.



The iPhone assigned to Farook also lacked a Touch ID feature, meaning the FBI cannot use the dead gunman's thumbprint to unlock it now. The FBI found the phone in a car after the shootings.



A U.S. magistrate last week ordered Apple to provide the FBI with highly specialized software that could be loaded onto the work-issued iPhone 5C used by Farook. He died with his wife in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in December.



The software would help the FBI hack into the phone by bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.



The FBI said it wants to determine whether Farook had used his phone to communicate with others about the attack.



FBI Director James Comey said the agency owes it to the victims of the San Bernardino terror attacks to try to gain access to a cellphone used by one of the gunmen.



In a message posted Sunday night on the Lawfare blog, Comey said the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead."" Comey said the court case ""isn't about trying to set a precedent"" but is instead about doing justice for the victims.



Apple has said it will protest the ruling and has until Friday to intervene in court.



San Bernardino had an existing contract with a technology provider, MobileIron Inc., but did not install it on any inspectors' iPhones, county spokesman David Wert said. There is no countywide policy on the matter and departments make their own decisions, he said.



MobileIron has confirmed that if the software were installed on the iPhone, it would unlock it.



Wert disputed the value of the remote management technology because he said Farook -- or any other county employee -- could have removed it manually. That would have alerted county technology employees and led them to intervene.



In many offices and classrooms, officially issued smartphones include the installed management software. It can unlock the phone, delete all information in case of loss or theft, track the device's physical location, determine which apps are installed, check battery life and push software updates. The technology is intended to make such products more suitable in corporate environments, where tighter controls are important to protect company secrets.



""This is the business case"" for mobile device management, said John Dickson, a principal at Denim Group Ltd., a security consultancy. ""The organization simply has no control or influence or anything over the device unless they have some MDM authority. The ability to do remote air updates, the ability to do remote wipe, the ability to control certain settings. Those are the standard kinds of things you do in mobile device management.""



Dickson said ""the big question now going forward, it builds the case for, is why this guy would have an essentially uncontrolled device.""



This is the first time since the county issued its first Blackberry device in 2003 that law enforcement has needed access to a locked county-owned phone, Wert said. Prosecutors said in court filings that the county gave its consent to search the device. County policy said digital devices can be searched at any time and Farook signed such an agreement.

Apple executives said Friday that the company had worked hard to help federal investigators get information off the locked iPhone, suggesting they use an iCloud workaround while the phone was connected to a familiar wireless network so that it would begin automatically backing up and provide access to data. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing legal process.



The executives said Apple sent engineers to work with the FBI on the workaround but the effort ultimately failed. The FBI said it worked with the county to reset the iCloud password a few days after the attack to try to get immediate access to the data. That effort eliminated the possibility of the Apple suggested workaround being possible.



But if the county had installed the management device it had bought onto Farook's phone, none of these efforts would have been necessary.



Ted Olson, a lawyer for Apple, told ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday that the legal fight had evoked an important debate about privacy and civil liberties. But he warned there'd be no limiting what the government could require Apple to do in the future if the Justice Department got its way this time.



""Apple has a responsibility to maintain the trust and faith of millions of people who've depended upon Apple to produce a product that protects their privacy -- their intimate, personal life,"" said Olson, a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ""This is a Pandora's box.""



Gartner Inc., a technology research firm, estimated that over 60 percent of large enterprises -- meaning business, government and educational entities -- used some kind of MDM software as of last year, though not necessarily on all company-owned devices. That percentage is likely higher now than when the research was done months ago, said Terrence Cosgrove, a research director with Gartner's mobile and client computing research group. Cosgrove said MDM adoption rates are generally higher among government users.



Many workers balk at the idea that the software can monitor and track their personal phones, said Alex Heid, chief research officer at the cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard Inc. But if the company provides a phone, it's considered reasonable practice to use such software.



""If a company's assumption is that they might not be able to get back into a device one day then it's not really a company asset at that point, it's a gift,"" he said.","['farook', 'apple', 'san', 'bernardino', 'installed', 'county', 'phone', 'unlock', 'iphone', 'common', 'allowed', 'device', 'fbi', 'software', 'technology', 'shooters']"

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Molitor hoping to push Twins to 'next level' in second year,[],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- On Tuesday night, Twins manager Paul Molitor caught Bruce Springsteen's concert across the state in Sunrise, Florida.

Molitor and the Boss have developed, if not a friendship, a mutual respect since meeting at Yankee Stadium in 1998, Molitor's final season as player, wrapping up his 21-year career.

The pair of Hall of Famers in their respective careers chatted before the show.

It gave Molitor a chance to be in what his wife calls one of his happier places. There are precious few opportunities for a major league manager for those kinds of leisurely nights from now until the end of the season.

But, with Twins pitchers and catchers reporting Monday, Molitor hopes his second season as a manager will lead him to another one of those happier places -- the postseason.

The Twins narrowly missed out last season, finishing 83-79 in second place in the American League Central, three games out of a wild-card spot. They were in the hunt until the final weekend.

A respectable finish, but not the one he wanted.

""It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth,"" Molitor said. ""But I'm looking at the new year as a new challenge. I understand that there are some things that can carry over, especially as experience is gained by staff and players.

""But I certainly don't assume that you just are naturally going to improve, because every year kind of stands on its own.""

Molitor, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2004, had never managed at any level before taking over the Twins last season.

""I had a lot of fun,"" he said. ""And I mention that because I think until you do something you're not sure how well it's going to fit, either how you think or how it's going to be challenging and how you're going to handle the day-to-day expectations that come with the position.

""So I enjoyed it. It was educational. I think that you kind of develop a newfound respect for people who have done it, especially people who have done it for a long time.

""There's different things you need to know in this role that you didn't need to know in other roles. And sometimes you feel humbled.""

Molitor, who grew up in St. Paul and was drafted out of the University of Minnesota by the Brewers with the third overall pick in 1977, played the final three years of his career with the Twins.

He began his coaching career in 2001 with the Twins as bench coach for Tom Kelly. He had also been a scout and a special assistant, a roving coach for the organization's minor league teams, and a coach for Ron Gardenhire, the man he replaced last season.

General manager Terry Ryan had no qualms handing the manager's job to Molitor and has watched him grow into the role.

""The main piece to this thing is he's been around for about a decade in our minor leagues,"" Ryan said.

""So it wasn't all that difficult to think with his baseball history and his experience as a player and his experience as a hitting coach and a minor league rover and his knowledge of the market and living in Minnesota -- he knows all about us. It fit pretty well obviously and he did a heckuva job.

""He's about as good a baseball man as I've ever been around.""

It didn't take the GM long to know he had made the right decision. The Twins struggled early last season, going 1-7 before three consecutive wins.

""Nobody really cracked,"" Ryan said. ""That was a pretty good sign that he had control, 'Listen, don't panic. We're in the first week to 10 days of the season.' He was calm and he was patient and he had a plan and approach and all the stuff that comes with leadership.""

Now, with a year of experience, Molitor is looking forward to getting the season started.

""I would like us to set a goal of playing extended baseball in the fall,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to the challenge that we have now that we have a little bit more expectations on our team at least from our fan base and people in our organization.

""I still see that we're not picked to do very well by a lot of people. But I'm looking forward to the challenge of trying to push us to the next level.""

Early Sunday morning, one of Molitor's coaches poked his head into the manager's office.

""Hi, boss,"" he said.

For now, that's Molitor's title. The other guy will have to wait.","['league', 'coach', 'hoping', 'level', 'season', 'manager', 'experience', 'looking', 'second', 'going', 'twins', 'push', 'think', 'molitor']"

Now, more than 70 years after Pfc. Thomas E. Davis was killed in the war's final battle, a tangible reminder of her beloved sibling has been found on the Pacific island of Saipan  one of his Army dog tags.

Related Image Expand / Contract World War II Pfc. Thomas E. Davis survived bloody fighting on Saipan only to die during the battle for Okinawa nearly a year later. (Courtesy David Hollingsworth via AP)

""He was a great guy,"" said Hollingsworth, 82, who lives outside Dayton, Ohio, noting that some of her earliest memories are of the tall, thin sibling 17 years her senior who always sat next to her at the dinner table. ""He was always laughing and singing and whistling.""

Cultural historian Genevieve Cabrera told The Associated Press in an email that she found the discolored metal tag sticking out of the soil of a farm field on Saipan in early 2014. It was embossed with Davis' name, serial number, hometown and other information.

Cabrera recently gave the tag to members of Kuentai, a Japan-based organization that has found the remains of five 27th Division soldiers on Saipan. The group notified the AP this month about the dog tag's discovery in the hope that his relatives could be found. The AP tracked down members of the soldier's family with the help of Anthony Barger, the archivist for the Putnam County Public Library.

Kuentai representatives said they'll arrange to meet the Davis family in the U.S. to hand over the tag.

While it is relatively common to find canteens, weapons and even unexploded shells from the 100,000 Americans and Japanese who fought for 25 days on the 46-square-mile island, dog tags remain a rare find, Cabrera said. The tags, attached to a chain worn around the neck, were the only item of military-issued gear a soldier wore daily that included potentially life-saving information such as blood type and when a tetanus shot was administered.

A year before Davis died in the battle for Okinawa in April 1945, he earned one of the nation's highest military honors after surviving the bloody fighting on Saipan.

According to wartime records kept at the New York State Military Museum, home to many of the 27th Division's documents, Davis earned the Silver Star on Saipan in June 1944 for risking his own life to rescue a wounded comrade ""at a time when the American front was undergoing brutal Japanese artillery and mortar fire.""

Davis went into the Army in September 1941, three months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor drew the U.S. into WWII. He served in the 165th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division, a New York National Guard unit mobilized into active service in 1940.

Davis was with the 27th when it took part in the Okinawa invasion, which began on April 1, 1945. Three weeks later, he was shot by a Japanese sniper while again helping a wounded soldier, according to what Hollingsworth says military officials told the family. Davis died April 30, two months shy of his 28th birthday. Four years later, his body was brought back for reburial in his hometown.

Davis was born and raised on his family's farm in Roachdale in Putnam County, Indiana, 30 miles west of Indianapolis. His mother died when he was a young boy, and his father remarried. Davis had six siblings: an older brother, Harold, three half brothers and two half sisters, including Hollingsworth. The brothers have died. His other half-sister, Hazel Priest, 81, lives in Victoria, Texas, and several nieces and nephews live in Texas, Ohio and Indiana.

Hollingsworth said Tom Davis, of Victoria, a 57-year-old machinist who was named after his uncle, will likely get the dog tag.

But a can of a citrus-flavored fruit drink, believed to be a prototype of Coca-Cola's reboot of a 1980s drink to promote the new Ghostbusters movie, has popped up on eBay and is creating quite a frenzy.

A can of the upcoming NEW-FOR-2016 Ecto Cooler has snuck onto eBay?!! HOLY. SHIT. (Thx @protoncharging for the tip!) pic.twitter.com/sxXgzsUvRL  Dinosaur Dracula (@DinosaurDracula) February 18, 2016

According to an eBay listing, the Ghostbusters Hi-C Ecto-Cooler can is a super rare item never offered on eBay before.

The eBay seller, Rkv-ent, claims the can belongs to a friend who used to work for a marketing company and received the item recently.

The drink was a green-colored sugar concoction that was originally created in 1987 by Coca-Cold as a tie-in for cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters the animated spinoff of the 1984 movie. The show went off the air in 1991, but the drink was so popular, Coca-Cola continued to make it 2001. The character Slimer disappeared from the box in 1997.

The auction for the canwhich appears to be devoid of any contents--ends on Sunday, Feb. 21 and so far bids for the drink are over $175.

Speculation over the possibility of Coca-Cola bringing back the retro drink has been rife. In September, the company re-registered the trademark for the citrus drink and fans have continued to buzz about it.

This comes amid the reboot of several other nostalgic drinks, such as a frozen citrus-flavored soda Surge by Burger King.","['selling', 'movie', 'company', 'ectocooler', 'reboot', 'ebay', 'item', 'hic', 'ghostbusters', '175', 'continued', 'cocacola', 'drink']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Children breast-feeding after first birthday should take vitamin D,[],"Children who breast-feed, especially those living far from the equator, may get too little vitamin D, according to a new study in Canada.

The longer children breast-fed, even if they also ate solid food or were older than one year, the greater their odds of having low levels of vitamin D, researchers found.

Breast milk does not provide enough vitamin D, particularly for people in northern parts of the world, so the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that breast-fed children take supplements containing 400 International Units of vitamin D every day for the first year of life.

""We're not saying that breast-feeding is not a really great source of nutrition, but up here in the northern parts of the world not much vitamin D passes through breast milk,"" said study coauthor Dr. Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician and researcher at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.

The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breast-feeding through the first six months of life and continuing it in addition to solid foods for the first and second years as mutually desired by mother and child.

Maguire and his coauthors studied how long children were breast-fed and their blood vitamin D levels using data from about 2,500 healthy children aged 1 to 5 years in Toronto. Mothers reported how long their child had been breast-fed and doctors collected blood samples from the children.

Mothers also reported whether their child was taking vitamin D supplements.

Half of the kids had been breast-fed for 10 months or more, and 53 percent received vitamin D supplements.

As breast-feeding duration increased, blood vitamin D levels decreased for children who did not take supplements. For every one month additional breast-feeding time, the odds of abnormally low vitamin D levels increased by 6 percent, the researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health, online February 18.

The pattern was so consistent that researchers predicted 16 percent of 2-year-olds breast-feeding but not receiving extra vitamin D would be seriously deficient, and by age 3, that would rise to 29 percent.

For children who did take supplements, breast-feeding duration was not tied to vitamin D levels.

These results support the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation of vitamin D supplements during breast-feeding, regardless of duration, Maguire said.

Just because a child has reached a year of age doesn't mean vitamin D supplementation can be stopped, he said.

The supplements are available in most drugstores, but parents may forget to buy them, he said.

""Probably most North American pregnant women get vitamin D supplements during pregnancy, even if this is not a very substantial amount,"" Martin Hewison of The University of Birmingham in the U.K. told Reuters Health by email.

""Vitamin D-deficiency is so very common during pregnancy and lactation but is still generally ignored unless the child develops rickets,"" said Hewison, who was not part of the new study.","['breastfeeding', 'breastfed', 'supplements', 'study', 'vitamin', 'levels', 'birthday', 'child', 'world', 'children', 'd']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Mom charged after leaving daughter in burning apartment,[],"A Florida mom allegedly left her 6-year-old daughter screaming inside a burning apartment and later fled the scene as firefighters rescued the girl, authorities said.

Erica Rosello, 32, was charged with child neglect with great bodily harm stemming from the Thursday blaze, The Miami Herald reported.

The girl was taken to a hospital, treated for smoke inhalation and is currently in the care of her grandmother. A judge has barred Rosello from seeing her daughter and placed Rosello under house arrest, according to CBS Miami.

Rosello was allegedly in the hallway of her apartment complex when a witness saw smoke coming from Rosellos apartment. The witness said Rosello denied there was a fire but acknowledged her daughter was inside, according to a police report obtained by The Herald. The witness tried rescuing the girl, but couldnt get inside the apartment.

Miami-Dade firefighter David Arencibia told WSVN that the girl would have died if she remained in the apartment for another 3 minutes.

I just told my partner to get on one knee, used him as a prop, he helped me up and I climbed in through the window, Arencibia said.

He added: When I picked her up, she started moaning, which was a good thing.

After firefighters saved the girl, Rosello fled. She later called her mom to check on the young girl and Rosellos mom convinced her to come to the hospital.

Its unclear what caused the fire, but authorities are investigating.

The firefighter basically entered a smoke-filled room and found the little girl lying on the bed, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokeswoman Erika Benitez told The Herald. This is the type of rescue that every firefighter hopes for, in the sense that it had the best possible outcome. She was brought out to safety and the fire was contained.","['apartment', 'daughter', 'burning', 'inside', 'firefighter', 'told', 'leaving', 'herald', 'mom', 'girl', 'rosello', 'witness', 'charged']"
foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Pacers-Heat Preview,[],"When they last met last month at American Airlines Arena, the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers engaged in a physical contest that reminded those involved of their recent playoff meetings.

This matchup could have a much difficult look if Miami has to play without its two stars.

With Dwyane Wade questionable and Chris Both out indefinitely, the Heat will try to continue their home dominance in this series Monday night by denying the Pacers a sweep of their road swing.

It appeared Indiana would take the first three games of this season series Jan. 4 when it opened up an 18-point third-quarter advantage. Wade, however, hit a left-handed layup at the buzzer to force overtime and teamed with Bosh for 58 points in the game as the Heat pulled out a 103-100 victory.

""It felt like a playoff game,"" said Wade, who has missed the past two games due to a sore left knee. If he's out again, Gerald Green will likely get another start.

Bosh has already been ruled out because of a blood clot in his left leg. The 11-time All-Star has led Miami in scoring in all three meetings with Indiana, while Wade has totaled 47 points in the last two.

The Heat have won 23 of the past 28 home matchups - including playoff series victories in 2012, '13 and '14 - against the Pacers dating to the '05-06 season. The Southeast Division leaders will likely have to keep getting contributions from others if they hope to win for the ninth time in 12 games.

Luol Deng has totaled 57 points and Goran Dragic has added a combined 41 in the last two games. Hassan Whiteside finished with 25 points and 23 rebounds in Saturday's 114-94 home win over Washington, recording the 11th 20-20 game off the bench in NBA history.

Whiteside had served a one-game suspension during Friday's 115-111 victory at Atlanta for throwing an elbow against San Antonio on Feb. 9. The center has totaled 22 boards in his last two meetings with Indiana but did not play in January due to a sore right knee.

''The next challenge for him is the consistency,'' coach Erik Spoelstra said. ''Does he have to do a 20-20 again on Monday? No, that is not what we're asking for. It's the not the statistics. It's his approach.""

The Pacers (30-25), seeking their eighth victory in the past 11 games, have an opportunity to tie the Heat (31-24) for fourth place in the conference. They've also opened the second half strong, topping Oklahoma City 101-98 on Friday and Orlando 105-102 on Sunday to begin this three-game trip.

Indiana has limited opponents to a 42.8 field-goal percentage - including 23.5 from 3-point range - in those two games. It'll need to continue that trend against a Miami team looking to score 110 points or more in three straight for the first time since November 2013.

The Pacers have held the Heat to 41.7 percent overall and 25.8 from long range in the season series.

''What I love about this team and the way we're playing now is I really trust our defense,'' coach Frank Vogel said. ''We were getting stops and giving ourselves a chance to win.""

Monta Ellis has scored a combined 41 points in his last two games against the Heat, while Paul George has come up big by averaging 30.3 points in the season series.","['pacersheat', 'miami', 'series', 'pacers', 'heat', 'points', 'games', 'season', 'wade', 'preview', 'indiana', 'totaled']"
foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Republicans have a weapon to stop Obama recess appointment,['Chad Pergram'],"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is bent on refusing to consider any nominee President Obama may submit to succeed late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. And if he doesnt give ground, Obama may have only one option for an end-run: a recess appointment.

But Republicans can rest easy: GOP leaders have an ace up their sleeve.

The truth is, it doesnt take much to prevent a recess appointment, as long as congressional leaders are watching the calendar. Closely.

If youre trying to block the president from making one to the Supreme Court, all the Senate has to do is commence a session every three days. Because the Senate is only truly in recess after that three-day period.

The Constitution actually requires the House and Senate to meet every three days unless theres an agreement between the two bodies to skip, and go on recess. With the battle over a Supreme Court pick heating up, dont expect that to happen in the near future.

All McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have to do is schedule what are called pro-forma sessions at three-day intervals for the rest of the year. Pro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting but a minute or two  and sometimes, a matter of seconds. They help the House and Senate comport with the constitutional mandate of huddling every three days  even if they arent really doing anything.

The House and Senate dont conduct any business during these confabs. In congressional parlance, theyre sometimes referred to as just gavel-in, gavel-out. No votes. No speeches. Few words are uttered at all.

The phrase pro-forma is derived from Latin, meaning formality.

Congress doesnt consider itself adjourned or on recess if its meeting every three days. And thats all it takes to block a recess appointment for the rest of the presidents term.

In 2011 and 2012, Democrats still controlled the Senate. But Republicans ran the show in the House. The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, the House and Senate met every three days.

In early 2012, the president made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments. The court said that was the point of the three-day sessions. The Senate was indeed in session. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against the administrations brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three days.

Ironically, Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case. They argued that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the Presidents arsenal. They added it was unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronism.

When the roles were reversed, Democrats used the same tool.

For much of the final two years of President George W. Bushs term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointment.

In 2003, Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations. Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats didnt like Pryors views on womens issues and homosexuality. So they filibustered Pryor.

During a summertime adjournment (not amid the three-day, pro-forma theater discussed here), Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consent.

Democrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer, too. But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three days.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Shoe designer Andrea Gomez brings the heat to runways of NY Fashion Week,['Rebekah Sager'],"For the past five years, this shoe designer from Venezuela has been channeling her shoe desires alongside countryman and well-established couturier Angel Sanchez at New York Fashion Week. All photos courtesy of Giselle Behrens.

Lets face it, nothing says sexy like a one-of-a-kind standout pair of sky high heels.

For the past five years, Andrea Gomez, a shoe designer from Venezuela, has been channeling her deepest desires alongside countryman and well-established couturier Angel Sanchez.

When you work with a designer, you have to first really understand their inspiration and the collection, and then translate that for the shoes, Gomez, 29, told Fox News Latino.

With him I know that the shoes need to be beautiful alone, but not upstage the clothes, she said of Angel, who has dressed celebrities like Salma Hayek, Sandra Bullock, Beyonce and Eva Longoria.

Gomez launched her career in 2011 with a store in Caracas, where she resides, after getting a degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology and a one-year stint with DKNY in New York City.

She connected with Sanchez three years ago, a relationship that  she says  has helped put her name on the fashion map.

Im working now on designing a new more high-end collection, she said. My designs have evolved from when I first launched, and the work Ive done for Angel has pushed my creative side.

New York Fashion Week came to an end Thursday with Fall/Winter collections featuring a ton of leather, a lot of lace, a bit of fur and surprisingly mountains of velvet. Silhouettes were mostly relaxed and many designers opted to show their collections in smaller and more intimate spaces.

Gomez said that her collection, which she sells online and through her two Caracas stores, tends to be more practical and traditional than what she creates for Fashion Week.

She described her aesthetic as feminine, but edgy with chunky heels.

In general I think of my line as young and colorful, very summery year-round, as Venezuela offers mostly warm weather, Gomez said.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Klein's overtime goal gives Rangers 1-0 win over Detroit,[],"Kevin Klein scored on a 2-on-1 break at 1:59 of overtime and the New York Rangers beat Detroit 1-0 on Sunday night, spoiling a magnificent effort by Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard.

Henrik Lundqvist made 22 saves in picking up his fourth shutout and helping the Rangers win for the seventh time in nine games (7-1-1).

Howard made 29 saves as the Red Wings lost their sixth straight road game, their longest skid since March 2012.

However, he forced the overtime with a pad save on a penalty shot by Jesper Fast with 5:25 left in regulation and then a sliding pad save on Fast in close with 3:45 to go.

Kevin Hayes led the 2-on-1 with Klein after Lundqvist barely stopped a shot by Gustav Nyquist in close and Chris Kreider cleared the puck from the crease and started the breakout.

Hayes carried the puck into the Red Wings zone and slid the puck to the defenseman on the left side for a shot that found the top right hand corner of the net.

Hayes had an apparent bad-angle goal nullified early in the third period when officials ruled that Oscar Lindberg's skate came up and hit the goaltender in the mask as he skated through the crease. Howard momentarily lost his balance and the shot came right after that.

The Red Wings' bench challenged the goal and won out.

They still lost the game.

Howard, who had not won since Dec. 3, looked like the Jimmy Howard of old when the Red Wings won Stanley Cups. He might have even won the game had not shots by Henrik Zetterberg in the second period and Pavel Datsyuk in the third hit goalposts.

The Red Wings are 4-4-3 in their past 11 games.

Lundqvist's best sequence came with 13 minutes left in the second period when he stopped a shot by Andreas Athanasiou on a shot breaking in from the left side and the ensuing rebound attempts in close by Brendan Smith and Teemu Pulkkinen. Zetterberg's shot banged a shot off the goalpost four minutes later.

Howard's best save in the middle period was a stop on Kreider right in front of the net with 7:40 to go.

The Rangers' bench was livid early in the period when Red Wings forward Darren Helm knocked J.T. Miller to the ice with a crunching elbow to the head.

The referee did not make a call and Rangers center Derick Brassard was called for a holding penalty when he went after Helm in the corner.

The goaltenders handled all 22 shots in the first period, with Howard stopping the first seven shots of the game, including a couple in close by Brassard. Lundqvist made his best stops on a break by Justin Abdelkader and a point-blank shot by Riley Sheahan.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,HPV rate in teen girls drops by more than 60 percent,[],"The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections among teenage girls in the United States has dropped by more than 60 percent since the vaccine against the cancer-causing virus was introduced a decade ago, according to a new study.

The researchers found that, within six years of the vaccine's introduction in 2006, the prevalence of HPV among girls ages 14 to 19 decreased by 64 percent.

And, among young women ages 20 to 24, the prevalence decreased by 34 percent over that same time period, the researchers found.

The new results suggest that the HPV vaccine ""is a very effective vaccine,"" said lead study author Dr. Lauri E. Markowitz, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In the study, the researchers pulled data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is a yearly survey of people in the U.S. that involves both interviews and physical exams. The researchers looked at data on the percentage of teenage girls and young women who were infected with HPV between 2003 and 2006  shortly before the vaccine was introduced in 2006  and then again between 2009 and 2012  several years after it was introduced.

Among girls ages 14 to 19, the researchers found, 11.5 percent were infected with HPV before the vaccine was introduced in 2006. That percentage dropped to 4.3 percent for the years between 2009 and 2012, the researchers found. [5 Dangerous Vaccine Myths]

Among women ages 20 to 24, the prevalence dropped from 18.5 percent before the vaccine was introduced to 12.1 percent in the years after it was introduced.

Three types of HPV vaccine have been available since the introduction of the vaccine in 2006, and clinical trials have shown that all three work well for preventing HPV infections, the researchers said. One of the vaccines, the bivalent one, targets two strains of the HPV virus. Another vaccine, called quadrivalent, targets four strains. The newest vaccine, 9-valent HPV vaccine, which was licensed in 2014, targets the same four strains of the virus as the quadrivalent vaccine plus an additional five HPV strains.

However, during the they years covered in the study, and until 2014, nearly everyone who received an HPV vaccination in the United States was given the quadrivalent vaccine, the researchers said.

The new results are in line in with previous research conducted by the CDC that also showed that the prevalence of HPV infections among 14 to 19 year-old girls had decreased after the introduction of the vaccine, the researchers said. Now, the new study adds the first evidence that also shows the impact of the vaccine on the prevalence of HPV in young women in their 20s, they said.

The CDC currently recommends the HPV vaccine for girls and boys at 11 or 12 years of age, administered in three doses over six months.

Through the new results are encouraging, the number of young people who have received the vaccine has increased more slowly than the researchers had expected, the researchers said. According to separate data gathered in the CDC in recent years, only 42 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 have received all three recommended doses of the vaccine.

The new study was published today (Feb. 22) in the journal Pediatrics.

Click here to subscribe to FOX411s YouTube channel

A few dozen people who comprised Lee's intimate circle gathered Saturday at a church in the small Alabama town of Monroeville, which the author used as a model for the imaginary town of Maycomb, the setting of her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Lee died Friday at age 89.

Lee's longtime friend, history professor Wayne Flynt, eulogized her in a ceremony at First United Methodist Church. Afterward, her casket was taken by silver hearse to an adjacent cemetery where her parents, A.C. Lee and Frances Finch Lee, and sister, Alice Lee, are buried. A spray of red and white roses covered the family headstone at the cemetery

Flynt said he delivered a eulogy that Lee specifically requested years ago. Entitled ""Atticus Inside Ourselves,"" it was a tribute Flynt gave in 2006 when she won the Birmingham Pledge Foundation Award for racial justice. Flynt said Lee liked the speech so much that she wanted him to give it as her eulogy.

""I want you to say exactly that,"" Flynt quoted Lee as saying at the time. ""Not one thing more, and not one thing less.""

""If I deviated one degree, I would hear this great booming voice from heaven, and it wouldn't be God,"" Flynt said in an earlier interview.

Details of the service were fiercely guarded. The author, who for decades had declined media interviews, had wanted a quick and quiet funeral without pomp or fanfare, family members said.

""We obeyed her wishes,"" said Jackie Stovall, Lee's second cousin.

The town was appropriately somber a day after their native daughter's death. Black bows adorned the doors of the old courthouse in Monroeville where Lee as a child, like her literary creation Scout Finch, would peer down from the balcony as her lawyer father tried his cases in the courtroom.

Mockingbirds chirped and frolicked among blooming camellia bushes outside the courthouse on a warm Alabama morning that teased the early arrival of spring.

Jared Anton, of Hollywood, Florida, sat outside the old courthouse during part of a planned vacation through the South that coincided with Lee's death.

Anton said reading the book  in which attorney Atticus Finch defends a wrongly accused African-American man  was one of the reasons he decided to become a lawyer.

""It had an impact on me when I was younger. I wanted to do the right thing, to stand up to people, to defend the innocent, if you will,"" Anton said. ""It is the greatest American novel. Name one that really has had more of an impact on Americans than that book.""

The Southern town was home to childhood friends Truman Capote and Lee, giving rise to its self-given nickname of the literary capital of the South. Ann Mote, owner of the Ol' Curiosities & Book Shoppe in Monroeville, said she thinks the town will always be linked to Lee.

""She's a part of it and always will be,"" Mote said.

Tributes to Lee's novel dot the town. The courthouse is a museum that pays homage to her creation. There's the Mockingbird Inn on the edge of town and a statute of children reading ""Mockingbird"" in the courthouse square. Tickets go on sale in a week for the city's annual ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" play, Mote said. A black mourning bow donned the top of the sign at the bookstore, where a stack of hardcopy ""Mockingbird"" books sat the counter along with a DVD of the movie.

The town this summer had a celebration for the release of ""Go Set a Watchman""  Lee's initial draft of the story that would become ""Mockingbird""  even though many residents had ambivalent feelings about its release.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Nelson Balido: Mexican cartels patrol border with drones  and U.S. has no response,['Nelson Balido'],"There are legions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, and they do not belong to the United States. They are owned and operated by Mexican drug cartels, and theres nothing we can currently do to stop them.

The proliferation of small, cheap UAVs (aka drones) has raised a litany of security concerns, from interference with commercial aviation to possible delivery systems for weapons. Along the U.S. southern border, the Mexican cartels are operating drones as intelligence gathering tools. Cartels traditionally have employed falcones (Spanish for falcons)people who perch on points along the border to monitor border patrol movements, collecting information that smugglers could exploit to outmaneuver Americas border security efforts.

Mexican cartels and criminals are operating with impunity, and it is having a definite impact on the volume of drug smuggling and illegal immigration. What steps are we going to take to address this fast-growing, fast-flying problem? - Nelson Balido

Today, those falcones are in the process of being replaced with a fleet of drones that fly along the U.S.-Mexico border, giving comprehensive real-time intelligence to smugglers on the location and movement of border patrol and other law enforcement officers and vulnerabilities in our border security infrastructure. This presents a long list of fatal challenges for all of Americas border security efforts. Foremost among them:

* With constant, real-time video of the U.S.-Mexico border, drug smugglers, human traffickers and others can simply identify the areas where law enforcement agents are not operating and cue an illegal crossing at those points. That easily defeats all of our randomized patrols and quick-response capabilities.

* Knowing where our patrol efforts are temporarily weakest, cartels and others can send a UAV with a payload of narcotics into the United States. They dont even need to worry about the mechanics of dropping cargo and bringing the drone back. The drug payload is worth tens or even hundreds of times more than the UAV, making the drone more or less disposable. This scenario has been occurring since 2010, and in April last year, a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near Calexico, California.

* With aerial video, criminals on the Mexican side could record identifying features of the law enforcement officers themselves and target them (or their loved ones) for violence. We cannot allow gangs of violent criminals to accumulate a photo roster of our dedicated agents who are already risking their lives to protect the border.

These serious implications for cartel-run UAVs are concerning enough, but more troubling still is that the United States has no capacity to stop them.

What options do we have? A sharpshooter with a long-range rifle could attempt to shoot down the drones, but given the size of the target and the speed at which it can travel and change direction, there is a good chance there will be missed shots, and who could say where that errant bullet might land or what it might strike?

The Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine has told the Border Patrol they cannot take steps of their own because airspace is their exclusive domain. For years, the Border Patrol has tried to obtain small UAVs for themselves that they could launch from the back of pickup trucks to do their own reconnaissance. Yet, currently, Air and Marine can only bring helicopters to bear. The result is that they would be using extremely high-powered machine guns on airships costing more than $1,500 an hour plus crew to try and take down a very nimble and low-flying UAV worth a fraction of that cost, to say nothing of the missed shots that would hail bullets on the ground below. This is the equivalent of bringing a Hellfire missile when all you need is a fly-swatter.

Some might think we can track the drones and trace them back to their operator. However, cartels have been sending much larger, manned ultra-light planes across the border for years, and we have a hard time even tracking those. If we cant always track a plane, we have no hope of keeping tabs on a legion fast, low-flying drones.

Perhaps more adventurously, we could consider some sort of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device that fries the UAVs circuits, but that would likely take out some of Americas border security technology in the process, and it would bring unforeseeable but certain unintended consequences.

And even if we did have some innovative response to this massive problem, U.S. Border Patrol agents cannot launch and use what they dont have. Given woefully insufficient attention and budget from Washington, theres no reason to believe new technology to address this situation is coming soon.

The result is the United States has no means by which to counter the criminal use of UAV activities along the border. Meanwhile, the cartels and other criminal organizations do have a way to counter American UAVs. It has been reported that some of the UAVs American law enforcement are using for operations lack critical security modules that can prevent GPS spoofing; that is, a simple cyberattack that sends the UAV incorrect GPS coordinates, causing it to fly away from its intended route.

This is bad all the way around. Mexican cartels and criminals are operating with impunity, and it is having a definite impact on the volume of drug smuggling and illegal immigration. What steps are we going to take to address this fast-growing, fast-flying problem? I have no idea.

And frankly, neither does anyone else.

Obama, in California this week for a fundraising swing, signed proclamations establishing three regions as national monuments  Mojave Trails, Castle Mountains (both in the Mojave Desert) and Sand to Snow in the Sonoran Desert.

The White House says the designations will nearly double the amount of public land that Obama has designated as national monument status since taking office.

""In addition to permanently protecting incredible natural resources, wildlife habitat and unique historic and cultural sites, and providing recreational opportunities for a burgeoning region, the monuments will support climate resiliency in the region ...,"" the White House said in a statement.

The designations will also connect those regions to other protected government land, including Joshua Tree National Park, the Mojave National Preserve and 15 other federal wilderness areas.

Mojave Trails National Monument, at 1.6 million acres, is by far the largest of the three new ones.

Sprawling across the vast Mojave Desert, it contains ancient lava flows, spectacular sand dunes, ancient Native American trading routes and World War II-era training camps. It also contains the largest remaining undeveloped stretch of America's Mother Road, historic Route 66.

Castle Mountains National Monument, also in the Mojave Desert, links two mountain ranges as it covers nearly 21,000 acres that hold numerous important Native American archaeological sites. The area is also home to golden eagles, bighorn sheep, mountain lions and other wildlife.

Sand to Snow National Monument rises from the floor of the Sonoran Desert to the 11,503-foot peak of Mount San Gorgonio, Southern California's tallest alpine peak.

Its diverse landscape includes the headwaters of the state's Santa Ana and Whitewater rivers and is home to 240 species of birds and 12 endangered or threatened species of wildlife. It also contains an estimated 1,700 Native American petroglyphs and 30 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Mentoring may help teens cope with chronic pain,[],"Adolescents dealing with chronic pain may benefit from the advice and support of a young adult who has learned to manage similar symptoms, a Canadian pilot study suggests.

After the eight-week program of scheduled video calls with a peer mentor, teenagers said they liked the experience and that they were better able to manage and cope with their pain, the study team reports in the journal Pain.

""Young people with chronic pain can become socially isolated and many have never met another person with chronic pain,"" said lead study author Sara Ahola Kohut, a pediatric health psychologist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.

""By having trained mentors, young people who are only a couple years older than the teens, teach coping strategies, we believed the pain coping skills might be easier to learn and practice,"" Kohut told Reuters in an email.

Chronic pain is a common problem, affecting between 11 and 38 percent of children and adolescents, Kohut and her colleagues note. Conditions like neuropathic pain, chronic widespread pain or chronic headache can lead to physical and emotional distress as well as causing teens to miss school, which affects their social development.

To assess how an online peer mentoring program might help teens deal with chronic pain, the study team recruited 28 kids ages 12 to 17 who'd been diagnosed with various chronic pain conditions at a Canadian hospital.

The teens were randomly assigned either to a group that would participate in the iPeer2Peer program or to a comparison group that was on a waitlist for the treatment. All the kids continued to receive any other usual care they were getting for their condition.

All of the teens in the treatment group were girls - researchers say that's because chronic pain is more common among females and during recruitment boys were less interested in participating.

The peer mentors were 18-25-year-olds with chronic pain disorders who had learned to manage their own pain successfully. Peer mentors went through a 20-hour training program, and were matched to a mentee based on gender, and when possible, diagnosis.

For the first two weeks, two calls a week were scheduled, then one call a week for the remaining six weeks of the program. During video calls using free Skype software, mentors gave the participants advice, emotional support and encouragement and let the mentees direct the conversation to address any issues they wanted help with.

The sessions were planned to last a minimum of 20 minutes but routinely ran about twice as long, the study team writes. Only 40 percent of peer-mentor pairs completed the program within eight weeks and there were some issues with scheduling calls.

Even so, the teens said they were satisfied with the program and would recommend it to a friend. Mentors, too, said they enjoyed the sessions and liked being in the mentor role.

Teenagers in the mentoring treatment group reported significantly better self-management skills after completing the program. They also reported being more satisfied with their own ability to cope with pain.

Sara King, a clinical psychologist and professor at Mount Saint Vincent University in Nova Scotia, said the online model is promising and may be more appealing to young people.

""Internet interventions have the added benefit of reducing the amount of time young people must spend away from school to attend medical appointments and they also allow some flexibility in terms of when and where the young person accesses support,"" King told Reuters Health by email.

This may be especially helpful for youth in rural or underserved areas, King added.

Although this is a preliminary study and cannot give definite answers, King said, ""Peers are so important to adolescents and, as clinicians we need a better understanding of how their peer can be part of the intervention process.""

Kohut said she is optimistic about the future of the program. ""The program is easily accessible, teenagers liked it, and it helped improve the teenagers' ability to cope with pain,"" she said.","['king', 'pain', 'help', 'cope', 'study', 'young', 'mentors', 'chronic', 'program', 'mentoring', 'peer', 'group', 'teens']"

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,To win in 2016 GOP must close technology gap with Democrats,['Van Hipp'],"It was July 2012. I was a member of Mitt Romneys National Finance Committee and, with the polls beginning to tighten, was feeling encouraged about his prospects to win the White House. That was until I spoke to Charles Harvey, one of the technology whizzes that the National Republican Congressional Committee brought in during the early 1990s to revamp their computer system, which helped give the GOP a technological edge in its 1994 takeover of the Congress.

He looked me in the eye and said, Romney is doomed.

He went on to tell me how the technology the campaign was using for its Get Out The Vote (GOTV) efforts was far inferior to that of the Obama campaign.

He then told me that there were other off-the-shelf solutions better than what the GOP had, but that most of those were from smaller companies that didnt have the contacts or the political consultants to get to the decision-makers.

He then specifically told me what was missing from the GOPs technology effort and how those gaps could be overcome in 30-45 days if the right people actually understood technology and moved quickly enough.

I reached out to friends close to GOP leadership to express my concern and received the expected Weve got everything covered and dont need any help response.

Well, on Election Day, November 6, 2012, the Romney campaigns GOTV app, known as ORCA, was a total flop.

ORCA crashed repeatedly. Grassroots volunteers at the local level were frustrated and many eventually quit even trying to use the system.

After the election returns came in and word began to leak out that the GOPs GOTV technology platform didnt even work, I remembered my conversation with Charles Harvey four months earlier.

He was right.

In this day and age of ever-increasing technology, the Romney campaign had two strikes against it from the start as a result of using a technology platform that was significantly inferior to the Democrats.

In essence, from a technology standpoint, the GOP was driving a Rambler, and the Democrats were driving a Rolls-Royce on Election Day.

Real technology experts were further horrified when it was revealed that the GOP never had a dry run test of ORCA to see how the app would even work over the Internet. The first time they tried it out was on Election Day itself.

There is still a real technology gap between the GOP and the Democratic Party.

The GOP can nominate the best candidate and have the best message, but it will lose again in 2016 if it doesnt close the technology gap that exists at the national level.

Over 90 million eligible voters did not vote in 2012. The votes are there for conservatives if they can close the technology gap and properly target their voters.

Interestingly, Mitt Romney actually won independent voters in 2012, while John McCain lost the independent vote in 2008, and yet they both got about the same number of popular votes. That further confirms that the GOP did a lousy job of turning out its base in 2012.

Reagan campaign veteran and Republican media strategist Marc Rotterman says, The two best run campaigns Ive seen in my lifetime were Reagan 1980 and Obama 2008. Reagan had the message and Obamas use of technology and data was second to none. To date, Im not sure the GOP has caught up. Rottermanss concerns are what worry knowledgeable observers on the right about 2016.

In talking with advisers to a number of GOP presidential campaigns, none have confidence in the Republican National Committees GOTV and analytics technology. One top aide even quipped, Their data analytics technology is only about fundraising.

Harper Reed was the Obama-Biden Chief Technology Officer who built a technology platform to make the process of voter contact more efficient and in real time.

On the right, no one understands this better than Voter Gravity CEO, Ned Ryun. Ryun says, The goal is to have on a mass scale high value, live contacts with targeted voters that are tracked in real time. Thats what technology is about: making that process more efficient.

Recently, Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasichs campaigns have talked openly about their analytics technology. Kasich is even using a data mining technology that targets possible supporters by looking not only at online data, but also off-line data like high school yearbooks and church lists.

Republicans need to be smart, not only in getting the best technology, but also in ensuring that the platforms that theyre relying on arent owned by companies that are already in the tank for the Democrats. And donors to presidential campaigns, the RNC, and SuperPACS need to insist that their dollars are spent narrowing the technology gap with Democrats.

The growing importance of having the right technology to win presidential elections is not confined to America. The Finnish outfit ZEFs electoral engine and voting aid technology has been highly successful and was used in last years British parliamentary elections.

The 2016 election will be the most important one in our lifetime. Whomever we elect as commander in chief will face the most complex foreign policy and national security situation an American president has ever faced.

Its a narrow pathway for the GOP and there is no room for error. Having the most advanced technology, big data, analytics, and GOTV, and tying it together in one platform will ensure that the 2016 Republican presidential nominee at least has a level playing field.

Despite being one of the countries most heavily affected by Zika, which is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito along with dengue fever and Chikungunya, Brazil has so far not required doctors or hospitals to report new Zika cases and thus no reliable statistics have been compiled for the outbreak of disease.

The South American giant has only reported weekly statistics on microcephaly cases, the birth defect which has affected a rising number of newborns and has been linked to Zika in pregnant women.

According to a bulletin released on Wednesday, in Brazil since last October 5,280 possible cases of babies with microcephaly or changes to their nervous systems have been registered, of which 508 cases have been confirmed.

Health authorities have ruled out microcephaly in 837 of the reported cases and are investigating the situation in 3,935 other patients suspected of suffering from the defect.

Now, however, suspected cases of Zika in pregnant women, as well as possible deaths from the disease, must be reported to authorities within 24 hours.

Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro said that the regulation also requires that microcephaly cases, which already must be reported, must be tallied separately from other congenital birth defects.

The minister said that he met with U.S. officials to discuss cooperating on - within one year - developing a vaccine against the virus and therapy to treat people who contract Zika.

The Brazilian government declared a health emergency last year over the Zika outbreak and its possible association with microcephaly. EFE

Continue Reading Below

Goolsbee addressed concerns about the slowing U.S. economy and the possibility of another recession.

I dont disagree with that on either count, I think we have been slowing and when Ive been on your show before Ive been saying I was worried about the Fed moving too quickly because the rest of the worlds borderline meltdown was going to have implications for the U.S. and meant we were likely to slow down. You cant rule out the possibility that we

would even go into a recession if they had a really hard landing in China and Europe deteriorated.

Goolsbee responded to Varneys argument that Republicans calls for tax cuts to stimulate the economy is a better solution than Democrats calls for more taxes and spending.

Well its not that in spirit that youre wrong, its that youre mischaracterizing the positions of both sides in the policy-sphere. First, the Democrats are not for lets just raise all taxes and spend money on nothing thats important for growth and the Republicans have not proposed anything like the judicious pro-growth policies you are describing.

When Varney pointed out Reagans tax cuts and subsequent economic growth to support his view, Goolsbee said, It was terrific growth, it was the second best in U.S. economic history following the first best which was under Clinton when they raised high-income tax rates.

Despite their opposing views on how to stimulate the economy Goolsbee proposed a plan.

What I want you to do Stuart is start looking around the world and you and I together plot how we are going to protect this country from the collapses in China and Europe.","['growth', 'goolsbee', 'youre', 'tax', 'slowing', 'economic', 'austan', 'taxes', 'stuart', 'stimulate', 'economy']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Across Europe, gay refugees facing abuse in asylum shelters",[],"Alaa Ammar fled Syria to escape not just civil war but also the threat of persecution as a gay man. Yet when he arrived in The Netherlands last spring, he did not find the safe haven he craved.

He and four other gay travelers had to face newly arrived asylum seekers at a migrant center in the remote northern town of Ter Apel.

""After five minutes, they started looking. After 10 minutes, they started to talk. After one hour, they came to us,"" said Ammar, a slender 28-year-old in tight jeans and with a diamond-like stud in each ear. ""After three hours, they started fighting with us.""

Across Europe, gay, lesbian and transgender migrants say they suffer from verbal, physical and sexual abuse in refugee shelters, and some have been forced to move out. The AP found out about scores of documented cases in The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, with the abuse usually coming from fellow refugees and sometimes security staff and translators.

The cases suggest a possible cultural clash: Many migrants are coming from conservative Muslim countries where homosexuality is taboo into European societies that are more open to it. In Syria, for example, homosexuality is illegal, and the militant Islamic State group has killed more than 30 gays in Syria and Iraq over the past two years, activists say.

A similar debate, this time over cultural attitudes toward gender, was sparked after young men assaulted and robbed hundreds of women in several German cities on New Year's Eve. Police described the men as of North African and Arabic origin.

The number of migrants accused of gay abuse are just a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into Europe. However, most abuse is likely not reported because of European privacy laws and the stigma felt by gay migrants, and there is no official tally across the continent.

In Germany, the Lesbian and Gay Federation counted 106 cases of violence against homosexual and transgender refugees in the Berlin region from August through the end of January. Most of the cases came from refugee centers, and 13 included sexual abuse.

Joerg Steinert, head of the federation in Berlin-Brandenburg, said refugees have been asking gay groups for help all over the country, reluctant to approach police for fear of jeopardizing their asylum applications. Last year, the federation placed 50 people in private homes because the migrant centers were too dangerous.

""These asylum shelters are law-free areas,"" he said. ""When I come to our office on Monday morning, there's usually a bunch of refugees waiting outside in the hallway who need help immediately.""

Charities and private shelter operators say they've simply been too overwhelmed by the huge influx of migrants to attend to some refugees' special needs. Swarms of people often live in one big hall, without lockable rooms or gender-separated washrooms.

In Berlin, where four hangars at the former Tempelhof airport were turned into a reception center for 2,100 people, four cases of gay abuse were reported. Maria Antonia Kipp, spokeswoman for private center operator Tamaja, said it's very difficult to create safe spaces for homosexuals when hundreds of bunk beds are separated only by thin wooden boards.

""When we see a dangerous situation or people tell us about it, we'll get the people out and transfer them to smaller shelters,"" she said.

The German Red Cross said it had a code of conduct banning violence at its shelters. And the Arbeiterwohlfahrt, or Worker's Welfare charity group, said it is trying to create safe spaces in new centers but cannot implement the highest standards it would like.

""We've been somewhat overrun by reality,"" said spokeswoman Mona Finder.

Some critics say it is up to the German government to protect migrants. But last month, a proposal to increase the security of asylum shelters was taken out of a government bill, despite official reprimands from the European Commission that Germany is not implementing EU safety guidelines.

Without the government, the protection of gay migrants has largely fallen to rights groups and local communities. On Tuesday, gay rights group Schwulenberatung Berlin will open a new home with 122 beds for gay refugees in cooperation with the city of Berlin and another shelter with 10 beds was recently opened in Nuremberg. Berlin has also appointed a counselor as contact person for the registration of gay and transgender migrants.

Schwulenberatung Berlin's Mahmoud Hassino said the new Berlin shelter would be a big improvement for gay, transgender and lesbian refugees.

""Gay refugees live in constant fear in the big shelters,"" said the 40-year-old Syrian refugee.

Hassino came to Germany in 2014 and had to move out of a Berlin shelter himself because of the hostility of fellow refugees.

""Even if they don't get abused right away, they're always afraid their identity will be revealed and then they'll be targeted,"" he said.

The situation for homosexual refugees is difficult all over Europe. In Spain, for example, two migrants from Cameroon and a third from Morocco were physically abused after their sexual orientation was discovered by others at shelters, according to the Pueblos Unidos nonprofit. The men now have asylum petitions pending before the Spanish government citing their homosexuality as a reason why they deserve refugee status, the nonprofit said.

In Sweden, a court sentenced an asylum seeker to five months in prison last summer for making death threats, along with spitting in the face and grabbing the throat of a fellow refugee in a center in Jonkoping. When the victim collapsed onto the floor, the attacker kicked him unconscious. Witnesses and a surveillance video backed the claims.

The motive was the victim's homosexuality. The attacker was ""outraged that Sweden protects homosexuality and all should be killed by slaughtering,"" according to court documents.

In Finland, cases of gay harassment and downright abuse have also been recorded at refugee centers, according to SETA, a nationwide lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group. As a result, some of the centers have separated a secure section for those afraid of sexual harassment.

Other migrants have contacted SETA after fleeing their designated refugee center because of abuse. Earlier this month, a Finnish court gave an asylum seeker a three-and-half-year prison sentence for raping another migrant man at a southern Finnish center.

In Denmark, there have been at least 10 cases of harassment, according to Mads Ted Drud-Jensen from the LGBT Asylum group. He stressed that those figures represent only victims who have been in contact with the group.

""Stepping out of the closet may be hard to do, and not everyone is talking to us,"" he said.

In the Netherlands, a Dutch human rights group reported earlier this month on regular abuse of gays and lesbians at a large camp that can house up to 3,000 asylum seekers near the city of Nijmegen. The group, The College for Human Rights, said one asylum seeker ""has repeatedly found excrement and food in his bed. He is threatened and abused by fellow residents.""

The asylum seeker, whose identity was not disclosed, said he feared for his safety because some other refugees carried knives. The report said he often found notes in his bed such as ""kill gay"" and ""we don't want gay in the camp.""

When Ammar reported abuse in Ter Apel, he and other gay refugees were put up on the floor of a restaurant for a night. Then they were transferred to another shelter in Apeldoorn.

There too, Ammar said, three fellow refugees attacked him and another man in the communal washroom and slashed them with a knife.

""You could see from their eyes that they wanted to hurt me,"" he said.

Again, Ammar was transferred, back to a caravan in Ter Apel. Employees with the COA asylum organization advised them to close the doors and windows, he said, but other asylum seekers ""opened the windows and said bad things to us.""

Spokesman Jan-Willem Anholts said COA does not keep records of complaints of gay abuse, but does have ""protective"" measures for people at risk. Anholts also raised concerns that creating safe houses for specific groups could lead to a type of ""segregation"" in Dutch society.

It was only after Ammar received asylum and moved in with a private host in Amsterdam a few weeks ago that he started to feel really safe.

""Who wouldn't like Amsterdam?' Ammar said as he looked carefully left and right before crossing roads  already seasoned at watching out for speeding bicycles in the Dutch capital. ""People don't care if I'm gay or not. I can scream 'I'm gay!' and they will say, 'Welcome.'""

In the weeks after an Aug. 15, 2009 New York Times report revealed that President Obamas then-chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had put the kibosh on a job for Sidney Blumenthal at Hillary Clintons State Department, two articles appeared on the website The Daily Beast slamming Emanuels historic stupidity and accusing him of reviving the GOP.

The articles authorship bears no indication that a personal vendetta may have driven the negative coverage of Obamas top aide. Written by center-right talk radio host John Batchelor, the critique reads as one Republicans strong rebuke of Emanuel, whose take-no-prisoners approach to politics had won him few friends on the other side of the aisle.","['website', 'articles', 'hit', 'won', 'commission', 'vendetta', 'vicious', 'rahm', 'pieces', 'emanuel', 'dept', 'state', 'written', 'daily', 'snub', 'sid', 'weeks', 'obamas', 'york']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Onlookers cheer as fire damages refugee center in Germany,[],"Onlookers celebrated as a suspected arson fire damaged a former hotel being converted into a refugee home in eastern Germany, police said Sunday, raising new concerns about violence toward new arrivals in a nation that registered more than a million asylum-seekers last year.

The blaze in the roof of the building in Bautzen, in the eastern state of Saxony, broke out overnight. Police said no one was injured but a group of people gathered outside, some ""commenting with derogatory remarks or unashamed joy"" at the fire.

While most Germans have been welcoming toward refugees, a vocal minority has staged protests in front of refugee homes, especially in the east. Germany last year saw a surge in violence against such lodgings.

Police ordered three people to leave the fire scene because they were hampering firefighters' work and then temporarily detained two of them, whom they described as intoxicated 20-year-old locals, after they ignored the order.

Investigators found traces of a fire accelerant at the scene and believe the fire was caused by arson, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether the building can be restored.

Saxony is home to the anti-Islam and anti-immigration group PEGIDA, and incidents there have caused concern before. In August, a mob in Heidenau, outside Dresden, hurled bottles and fireworks at police protecting a shelter being set up for refugees.

The Bautzen fire came after a mob in the small town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony, on Thursday screamed ""We are the people!"" and ""Go home!"" as they blocked a bus carrying asylum-seekers outside a new refugee home.

Police drew criticism in that case for roughly hauling some refugees off the bus into the building  which they insist was necessary to prevent the situation from escalating  and for saying that some of the refugees had made provocative gestures.

Saxony Governor Stanislaw Tillich called the two incidents ""appalling and shocking"" and described the perpetrators as ""criminals.""

""This is abhorrent and disgusting,"" Tillich told the Funke newspaper group. He pledged that authorities will investigate and ""bring everyone responsible to account.""

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that everyone in Germany is entitled to express their concerns ""but there is a threshold of decency and law that must not be crossed  and this threshold was clearly crossed in the incidents in Saxony,"" the news agency dpa reported.

""It is completely unacceptable for people who are seeking protection from persecution here to be greeted with hatred and agitation,"" de Maiziere added.

Later Sunday, the minister defended police actions in Clausnitz, saying they were right to get all the refugees off the bus quickly and into the building. If the bus had been backed away from the refugee home, ""these bawling people would have had their way,"" de Maiziere said on ARD television.","['building', 'maiziere', 'group', 'center', 'saxony', 'bus', 'refugee', 'outside', 'cheer', 'germany', 'damages', 'incidents', 'refugees', 'onlookers']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Libya disaster: Have Western leaders learned anything?,['Pete Hoekstra'],"That the U.S. has launched airstrikes against ISIS in Libya should demonstrate once and for all the total disaster of the NATO-led adventure to overthrow Muammar al-Qaddafi in 2011.

Libya devolved into a failed state when NATO assisted Qaddafis radical jihadist opponents in killing him and then promptly abandoned the country. Left in the wake were two rival governments competing for power, which created space for Islamists to turn Libya into a cesspool of extremism.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to call the debacle American smart power at its best. Other presidential candidates still argue that it was the right thing to do.

How will the West ever learn anything if it cant identify its most obvious failures?

Libya has no central functioning government that can provide security for its citizens. ISIS fights to expand its caliphate along the Mediterranean to points as close as 200 miles from Europes vulnerable southern border. It controls Qaddafis hometown of Sirte. It has imposed Shariah law in the areas under its control. It exploits Libya as a base to export weapons, jihadists and ideology to Europe, other African countries and the Middle East.

Benghazi and Derna, which have long been hotbeds of radicalism, provided more fighters per capita to Afghanistan and Iraq than nearly any other area in the world. The difference between then and now is that Qaddafi kept the lid on the garbage can long before 2002-2003, when he became a reliable U.S. ally against radical Islam. He changed his behavior, gave up his nuclear weapons program, paid reparations to the victims of his atrocities and provided invaluable intelligence that disrupted numerous Islamist terror plots.

It represented a massive foreign policy success, and the U.S. thanked him by facilitating his murder.

Similarly, the West embraced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his struggles against Islamist forces, and then it threw him under the bus. Both Qaddafi and Mubarak did everything asked of them, but they ended up dead or in jail.

Any leader would really need to ask why he should trust NATO or the West. Is there any question why Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad does not negotiate an end to his countrys civil war and clings to Iran and Russia to keep him in power?

Iran cheated on its nuclear program for years. As a result, the U.S. gifted it with more than $100 billion  including $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars  and it hasnt changed its behavior in the slightest. In addition to its military ambitions, Iran will most assuredly spend the money on supporting Assad and its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, Africa and, yes, Europe.

Im amazed by some of the statements now coming from the coalition. The French defense minister is concerned about ISIS fighters blending in with refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Talk about restating the obvious. The British want troops to identify friendly militias in order to avoid targeting them in future airstrikes. Has something changed where we have improved the vetting of moderate militia groups?

NATO failed miserably in Libya and in Syria the first time around. Whats different now?

The only official who seems to make any sense is U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who said recently, The Libyans dont welcome outsiders intruding on their territory. He was referring to ISIS, but he might as well have been talking about the West. Libyans have not forgotten that NATO all but vanished once Qaddafi was killed.

Western foreign policy is in disarray. The scariest part is that supposed leaders dont even know it, and therefore they cant admit to previous mistakes. Allies that brought stability to the region are gone. Former and current antagonists benefited from Western incompetence.

Who would have predicted six years ago that those rulers battling Islamist terror would be deposed and that those committing it would become the Wests new friends?

NATO snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Libya. Refugees flood Europe. Terrorist attacks continue to spread geographically and in lethality. The Syrian civil war rages on. Iran lavishes its newfound wealth on its nuclear program and campaign of global terror.

Is it any wonder that citizens in Western countries are frustrated and angry with those in positions of authority?

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Michigan State gives Dantonio a raise after banner season,[],"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio is getting a raise after leading the Spartans to college football's playoff.

The school announced Friday that Dantonio's annual compensation is increasing from $3.67 million to $4.3 million. His revised contract is still a six-year rollover deal.

''With three straight top-10 finishes and two Big Ten championships during that same period, Mark Dantonio and his coaching staff have built an elite football program,'' athletic director Mark Hollis said. ''Michigan State's football brand has never been stronger. We're so excited about the future of our football program under Mark's leadership and direction.''

Dantonio's team has gone 36-5 over the past three seasons with two Big Ten titles. The Spartans won the Rose Bowl at the end of the 2013 season, and they reached the national semifinals in 2015.

The school says Dantonio's base salary increases from $2 million to $2,264,480, and his contingent annual bonus goes up from $286,000 to $700,000. The contract now includes a one-time $4.3 million contingent annual bonus if he remains Michigan State's coach through Jan. 15, 2020, and if Dantonio retires before then, he'll be provided with post-coaching employment for one year with a salary of $1 million.

Also, if he leaves, the buyout provision of the contract has been eliminated.

The school also announced that nearly $250,000 has been allocated to enhance the salaries of assistant coaches.","['school', 'football', 'raise', 'season', 'michigan', 'million', 'spartans', 'contract', 'mark', 'states', 'state', 'dantonio', 'annual', 'banner', 'gives']"
foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Volkswagen Mexico says environmental certificate problem was 'administrative error',[],"German automaker Volkswagen's Mexican unit said an administrative error resulted in the company's vehicles lacking a necessary environmental certificate and being fined nearly $9 million, but it said it now had all of the required permits.

Mexico's Profepa environmental protection agency imposed the 168-million-peso ($8.9-million) fine on Volkswagen Mexico for importing and selling 2016 model vehicles in the country that lacked an environmental certificate showing compliance with emissions standards.

""This was due to an administrative process that was unintentionally not carried out on time within Volkswagen Mexico,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday.

""Currently all 2016 model vehicles of the group's brands"" have the required permits in compliance with current environmental regulations, Volkswagen said, adding that all of its vehicles ""are safe from a technical standpoint and can be used without restriction.""

The NOM environmental compliance certificate establishes, among other things, the maximum allowable level of total hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and particles from new cars' exhaust pipes and also sets the maximum allowable level of noise and the measurement methodology.

Volkswagen Mexico was fined for importing and selling 45,494 Audi, Bentley, Porsche, Seat and Volkswagen vehicles in Mexico that lacked that environmental permit, Profepa said in a statement.

Profepa said the fine was separate from an investigation being conducted in Mexico over the Volkswagen defeat device scandal.

In September of last year, Environment Secretary Rafael Pacchiano said Mexico would review Volkswagen's emissions certificates for diesel engine vehicles the automaker had sold in Mexico since 2009 to verify if they were in compliance with national standards.

That probe came after Volkswagen acknowledged that the defeat devices had been installed on nearly 500,000 2.0-liter diesel-powered Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles sold in the United States since 2008.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused the automaker last September of using the devices to dupe regulators.

The software on those engines detected when emissions testing was taking place and activated the cars' emissions controls.

When those same vehicles were being driven under normal conditions, the controls were turned off and they spewed up to 40 times the United States' legally allowable amount of nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the formation of smog and acid rain.

The automaker said last September, after the scandal broke, that 11 million of its vehicles worldwide had been equipped with the defeat devices.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

For the last 4 months she has been in and out of the hospital, fighting one setback after another, accompanied by excruciating pain in her back, ribs and gallbladder; and ending with a fall when trying to walk, (without waking me to assist her) to the bathroom. She fractured her tailbone and had pain coming from everywhere.

A wonderful pain management specialist, Dr. Christine Lee has entered Noreen's life, and her pain has become manageable.

Spine doctor Dr. Sang Kim determined Noreen's tailbone fracture was not caused by her cancer. She was prescribed progesterone, and after 10 radiation treatments to her back, something started to work. She underwent a blood transfusion and painful Neupogen injections (which stimulate white blood cell growth), and suddenly her markers went down.

Miraculously, Noreen has bounced back.

Pain will remain a part of her life (but will be managed well). I got rid of the wheelchair, and bought her a neat walker -- and she is rounding-into her old self. This is proven by the fact that last night she cleaned the kitchen while I slept. And when Noreen cleans, look out!

Tonight I am taking this wonderful woman out to dinner. Wow!

Summit Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ronda Churchill)

""Pacific Rim"" filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and ""Metal Gear Solid"" video game creator Hideo Kojima had big plans for their top-secret interactive collaboration.

""We had great ideas that I think would have done fantastic,"" del Toro said on stage Thursday at the Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's annual D.I.C.E. Summit.

The writer-director of such films as ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Crimson Peak"" reunited with Kojima for a talk at the 15th annual gathering of elite members of the video game industry. The appearance marked the pair's first public appearance together since their video game, ""Silent Hills,"" was canceled last year by publisher Konami.

The title was intended to be the next installment in the long-running ""Silent Hill"" horror franchise and feature ""The Walking Dead"" actor Norman Reedus. Del Toro and Kojima teased it last year with the release of a mysterious PlayStation 4 demo called ""P.T.""

""'P.T.' itself was meant to be sort of a decoy,"" del Toro said. ""We were thinking it would take (players) 10 days, two weeks to solve it. They solved it in three days.""

The pair  fans of each other's work  first met when del Toro was in Japan to promote ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."" They quickly became friends, and del Toro invited Kojima to his ""man cave,"" populated with the quirky filmmaker's games, toys and other geeky collectibles.

Kojima, who was affiliated with Konami since 1986, is being inducted this year into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. After finishing work on ""Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"" he is now working on a PS4 game with a newly formed studio, Kojima Productions.

""I feel extremely free right now,"" the Japanese game designer said through a translator. ""I'm trying to make a very big game with an extremely small team. I am doing exactly what I want to do.""

Despite the duo moving on to other projects, del Toro is hopeful that he'll again collaborate with Kojima.

""I'll do whatever the (expletive) he wants,"" the filmmaker said with a big grin, motioning to Kojima.","['video', 'kojima', 'solid', 'big', 'hideo', 'work', 'filmmaker', 'game', 'summit', 'del', 'silent', 'reconnect', 'guillermo', 'interactive', 'toro', 'dice']"

The group said it released the info Sunday night in response to Wednesdays shooting death of Paul Gaston, a black man, by three white Cincinnati cops. By 4:30 a.m. Monday the video had been taken down, according to WLWT.

Thin Blue Line, your game is over, an Anonymous figure said in the video, according to a transcript. You lost. While we release your officers information, we will hold no responsibility of the actions of those that see the information.

That information included names, ages, street addresses, email addresses and social media accounts, as well as the names and addresses of officers family members. Its unclear if the information was obtained via a data breach or through publicly available sources, Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders told Cincinnati.com.

The incident that prompted the Anonymous action involved the somewhat contentious details surrounding Gastons death. While video of the incident shows Gaston initially on his knees with his hands behind his head as cops approach him, police said he reached toward his waistband for what they believed to be a weapon before they shot him. Video evidence appears to back up the officers assertions. After his death, authorities discovered Gaston was carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon.

Anonymous included footage of the shooting  which police had previously released  as part of its video message.

For far too long we have sat idle by letting the gang known as the Thin Blue Line murder citizens of United States without allowing them due process, the video transcript said. Well, we have a message to not only the Cincinnati Police Department but to every law enforcement officer. When you murder a human being when you have other choices of containing your suspect available, we will make your officers information public record.","['hacker', 'information', 'death', 'cincinnati', 'addresses', 'releases', 'employees', 'officers', 'video', 'anonymous', 'department', 'group', 'shooting', 'transcript', 'gaston']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,145 Cuban migrants stranded in Panama get permits to continue journey to U.S.,[],"More than 100 Cuban migrants from among the 1,300 stranded in Panama on Sunday received immigration permits that early next week will allow them to travel legally to Mexico, where they will be able to continue their land journey to the United States.

The deputy commissioner of the Panamanian Immigration Service, David Rios Duran, told EFE that 145 people are being given free travel permits as a humanitarian gesture to allow them on Monday to travel to the Tocumen International Airport, where on Tuesday they will fly to Mexico.

This is the first group to resume their trek from Panama to the United States after Costa Rica closed its border in December saying it was unable to continue housing the more than 7,000 Cubans who were also trying to make it to the United States but who had been stranded there after being denied passage through Nicaragua.

The 145 migrants chartered a private bus for $14 per person to take them from the city of David, near the Costa Rican border, to the capital airport starting at 5 p.m. on Monday, where early Tuesday morning they will board their flight to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

They began buying their air tickets on Feb. 10 for $523.50 per person.

Another bus - costing $13.50 per person - will await them in Ciudad Juarez, where the authorities will see to it that they arrive in El Paso, Texas, Isabel Cristina Perez, one of the migrants, told EFE.

Once they get to Ciudad Juarez, the Cubans will receive a visitors document as a humanitarian gesture giving them 20 days to cross into the United States, an official with the Mexican National Immigration Institute told EFE last Thursday.

foxnews,2016-02-01 00:00:00,UK fertility regulator approves controversial gene editing technique,[],"Britain's fertility regulator has approved a scientist's application to edit the genetic code in human embroys.



In a statement Monday, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it has approved research led by scientist Kathy Niakan to try to understand the genes that embryos need to develop successfully.

Niakan, of the Francis Crick Institute, plans to use gene editing to analyze the first week of an embryo's growth.



Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, said Niakan's research would ""enhance our understanding of (in vitro fertilization) success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development.""

The scientists will not be allowed to implant any embryos used in their research into women. The embryos, which would be donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment who do not need them, must also be destroyed after two weeks.

Last year, Chinese researchers made the first attempt at modifying genes in human embryos. Their laboratory experiment didn't work but raised the prospect of altering genes to repair the genes of future generations.

Scientists say such techniques could lead to treatments for inherited diseases like muscular dystrophy and HIV. Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to genetically modified human babies.

Around the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what kind of research on embryos that will change the genes of future generations, is allowed. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund this kind of research but private funding is allowed.



Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to a slippery slope.



""This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalization of (genetically modified) babies,"" said David King, of anti-gene manipulation group Human Genetics Alert, last month when the British fertility regulator held its meeting to decide on granting the gene editing license.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Massachusetts plans rattlesnake colony on uninhabited island,[],"A plan by the state to establish a colony of venomous timber rattlesnakes on an off-limits island in Massachusetts' largest inland body of water has some rattled by visions of dangerous serpents slithering through the surrounding woods, attacking hikers, fishermen and hunters.

Those are completely irrational fears based on the public's aversion to snakes, said Tom French of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, who's directing the project at the 39-square mile Quabbin Reservoir and representing the state at a public meeting Tuesday to address the concerns.

French said he's received several emails and phone calls from worried residents who fear the snakes will escape the island.

Div. of Wildlife and Fisheries, a timber rattlesnake slithers across a flat rock in Western Massachusetts.

Division of Fisheries and Wildlife via AP)

""People are afraid that we're going to put snakes in a place of public use and that they are going to breed like rabbits and spread over the countryside and kill everybody,"" he said.

There are only about 200 of the endangered snakes indigenous to Massachusetts left in five scattered pockets from greater Boston to the Berkshires, French said. Loss of habitat and human-caused deaths means they could disappear altogether, which is why the Quabbin project is so critical.

The plan to establish the snakes on Mount Zion  at more than 1,400 acres, the largest island in the reservoir  has been in the works for several years. A handful of snakes will be raised at Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, and placed on the island in a couple more years when they are mature enough to survive in the wild.

The project has received the endorsement of Gov. Charlie Baker.

The public's concerns stem from the fact that rattlesnakes can swim and the island is connected to the mainland by a pair of narrow causeways, French said.

Bob Curley, an avid hiker, isn't opposed to the rattlesnake preservation effort; he just doesn't think the Quabbin is the place to do it. Even though Mount Zion of off limits to the public, he's concerned the state will use the snakes as an excuse to shut off public access to areas around the reservoir about 65 miles west of Boston.

""When the inevitable happens and there is an interplay between a hiker and a rattler, what's the repercussion?"" said the Athol resident, who said his dog was bitten by a rattlesnake last summer. ""Are the trails around the Quabbin going to be shut down?""

There is no plan to deny public access to the Quabbin, and concerns that snakes will leave the island and threaten humans are unfounded, French said.

Rattlesnakes are timid and only strike out when provoked. There have been no documented rattlesnake bite deaths in Massachusetts since colonial times, he said. He can't even recall an accidental bite in his 32 years with the state agency even though Massachusetts' rattlesnake populations live largely in public lands that get heavy foot traffic.

On Mount Zion, the snakes will be safe from human interference, have ideal places to hibernate and plenty of mice and chipmunks to eat.

""We want one place where the impact of people in not part of the equation,"" French said.

The state's message appears to be getting out.

Nancy Allen, chairwoman of the selectboard in Petersham, a town on the eastern shore of the reservoir, said she heard from fearful residents when the plan became public, but those fears died down once people educated themselves about the project.

""Once they started to look into the facts, people started to change their minds,"" she said.

Peter Mallett, a recreational fisherman who lives in New Salem, a town on the Quabbin's western shore, opposed the snake project at first, but changed his mind after digging deeper.

""People are just petrified of snakes,"" he said.","['plans', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'reservoir', 'colony', 'rattlesnake', 'french', 'state', 'massachusetts', 'quabbin', 'plan', 'public', 'snakes']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Russia wants to fly surveillance planes over US with advanced cameras, congressional staffer says",[],"Russia will ask permission on Monday to start flying surveillance planes equipped with high-powered digital cameras amid warnings from U.S. intelligence and military officials that such overflights help Moscow collect intelligence on the United States.

Russia and the United States are signatories to the Open Skies Treaty, which allows unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of all 34 member nations to foster transparency about military activity and help monitor arms control and other agreements. Senior intelligence and military officials, however, worry that Russia is taking advantage of technological advances to violate the spirit of the treaty.

Russia will formally ask the Open Skies Consultative Commission, based in Vienna, to be allowed to fly an aircraft equipped with high-tech sensors over the United States, according to a senior congressional staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the staff member wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

The request will put the Obama administration in the position of having to decide whether to let Russia use the high-powered equipment on its surveillance planes at a time when Moscow, according to the latest State Department compliance report, is failing to meet all its obligations under the treaty. And it comes at one of the most tension-filled times in U.S.-Russia relations since the end of the Cold War, with the two countries at odds over Russian activity in Ukraine and Syria.

""The treaty has become a critical component of Russia's intelligence collection capability directed at the United States,"" Adm. Cecil D. Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, wrote in a letter earlier this year to Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of a House subcommittee on strategic forces.

""In addition to overflying military installations, Russian Open Skies flights can overfly and collect on Department of Defense and national security or national critical infrastructure,"" Haney said. ""The vulnerability exposed by exploitation of this data and costs of mitigation are increasingly difficult to characterize.""

A State Department official said Sunday that treaty nations had not yet received notice of the Russian request, but that certification of the Russian plane with a ""digital electro-optical sensor"" could not occur until this summer because the treaty requires a 120-day advance notification. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

The official also said that the treaty, which was entered into force in 2002, establishes procedures for certifying digital sensors to confirm that they are compliant with treaty requirements. The official said all signatories to the treaty agree that ""transition from film cameras to digital sensors is required for the long-term viability of the treaty.""

In December, Rose Gottemoeller, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, sought to temper concerns about Russian overflights, saying that what Moscow gains from the observation flights is ""incremental"" to what they collect through other means.

""One of the advantages of the Open Skies Treaty is that information  imagery  that is taken is shared openly among all the treaty parties,"" she said at a joint hearing of the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees in December. ""So one of the advantages with the Open Skies Treaty is that we know exactly what the Russians are imaging, because they must share the imagery with us.""

Still, military and intelligence officials have expressed serious concern.

""The open skies construct was designed for a different era,"" Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers when asked about the Russian overflights during a congressional hearing. ""I'm very concerned about how it's applied today.""

Robert Work, deputy secretary of defense, told Congress: ""We think that they're going beyond the original intent of the treaty and we continue to look at this very, very closely.""

Steve Rademaker, former assistant secretary of state for the bureau of arms control and the bureau of international security and nonproliferation, told Congress at a hearing on security cooperation in Europe in October that Russia complies with the Open Skies Treaty, but has ""adopted a number of measures that are inconsistent with the spirit"" of the accord.

The treaty, for instance, obligates each member to make all of its territory available for aerial observation, yet Russia has imposed restrictions on surveillance over Moscow and Chechnya and near Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he said. Russian restrictions also make it hard to conduct observation in the Kaliningrad enclave, said Rademaker, who believes Russia is ""selectively implementing"" the treaty ""in a way that suits its interests.""","['wants', 'fly', 'united', 'intelligence', 'cameras', 'surveillance', 'state', 'staffer', 'advanced', 'planes', 'russian', 'military', 'security', 'treaty', 'open', 'russia', 'congressional', 'skies']"

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Barbara Bush: Jeb is ready to be the commander in chief America needs,[],"Our nation is at a crossroads. The political dysfunction in Washington, DC has left many Americans feeling disillusioned, disenfranchised and  maybe most of all  angry that their elected leaders arent listening to them. Clearly, the country is yearning for strong leadership to get this great nation moving in the right direction again.

For Republicans, our party faces a critically important choice this Saturday too. In a crowded and competitive field, a very fine man stands out as the only proven conservative who has governed a major swing state and solved the kinds of big, difficult problems the country faces in Washington today. His name is Jeb, and here is why you should vote for him.

Leading Florida for eight years, Jeb held true to his conservative values while bringing Republicans and Democrats together around a series of reforms that made his state the national leader in job creation and small business creation. Hes the only candidate in the race who can say he has already cut the size of government, and on top of that he balanced eight budgets and provided $19 billion of tax cuts to Floridians.

Jeb is also passionate about reading and learning and recognized that, without a good education, a child cannot be expected to live a life of meaning and purpose. That is why he challenged the teachers union in Florida to pass sweeping  and conservative  education reforms that expanded school choice and provided parents and students with better learning opportunities. Today, Floridas high school graduation rate is nearly 50 percent higher than when Jeb passed his A+ reforms.

In the end, however, this nomination fight is not about the past. Rather, its about the future  your future. It is about your family, and your children, and who you want in the Oval Office that can actually deliver the economic growth, national security and real government reforms our country desperately needs.

The choice is clear.

Other candidates  who have no comparable record of accomplishment to which they can point  seem to measure strength by the loudness of their voices or the harshness of their tone. Jeb is even-tempered, serious and resolute  which history has repeatedly shown to be the true sign of executive strength.

The fact that Jeb has been endorsed by 30 retired admirals and generals and 12 Medal of Honor recipients speaks volumes about his readiness to serve as Commander-in-Chief. Jeb will be a president who restores our military strength and respects our veterans, and his economic plans will strengthen job growth and result in working families receiving a pay raise for the first time in a long time.

No one running for president has achieved more positive change for people in a bigger state than Jeb did. He was a transformational governor and I believe he would be a transformational president. I know that, if American people give Jeb their trust, he will work tirelessly to change the broken culture of Washington and to lift our great nation to new heights.

Is Trump losing his one big lead in South Carolina?

Just days before the South Carolina primary, some polls have shown Trumps once-huge lead in Palmetto State is shrinking.

But now, hours before voters head to the polls, FOX Business Charles Gasparino is hearing it from inside sources that both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are seeing surges in support.

On Fridays show, Gasparino told Tom Sullivan the campaigns and the big money behind them are seeing private poll numbers that suggest both Republican Senators may do better than the pundits expect and even top Donald Trump!

And while you may have some doubts, Gasparinos sources also predicted Cruz and Rubios success in Iowa and Kasichs surprising finish in New Hampshire!

So will Trump get Trumped in South Carolina?

The stick brandished by sea lion Milo was made by aquarium volunteer Hugh Ryono.  I just thought it would be neat to see a swimming sea lion from the same selfie stick perspective that surfers and other action sports athletes use to give a you are there feel to their shots, he explained, in a blog post.

An avid photographer and videographer, Ryono used an old aquarium target pole and mounted a GoPro camera on the end where the float is. The float actually neutralized the weight of the camera and mount which made it easy for a sea lion to hold while swimming underwater, he wrote. I had Milo try out the rig during an early morning training session. After checking out the feel of the selfie stick Milo proceeded to take the camera on a quick but exciting circuit of the front pool of the exhibit.

The result is a short but fascinating video of Milos trip around the pool.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"Michigan police say 6 dead in random shooting spree, suspect arrested",[],"The accused gunman who police say killed six people and wounded two others during a rampage in Michigan on Saturday night is a married father of two who was working as an Uber driver, USA Today reported.



Jason Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber, the company told the paper. Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations, police said.

A Michigan prosecutor said authorities were investigating a Facebook post that indicated Dalton picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he was aware of the post, but was not prepared to discuss it.

Dalton lived just outside Kalamazoo, where the shootings occurred, in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.

Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said investigators contacted Dalton's wife Saturday evening ""to make sure she wasn't a victim."" Hadley added that she's cooperated with police in their investigation.

Law enforcement sources told WMMT-TV that Dalton was arrested without incident early Sunday morning in downtown Kalamazoo following a massive manhunt.

Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said. A woman shot outside an apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday, Matyas said. The 14-year-old girl was in critical condition.

Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as ""our worst-case scenario.""

""These are random murders,"" he said.

He described a terrifying rampage that began about 6 p.m. in the parking lot of the apartment complex in Richland Township on the eastern edge of the Kalamazoo County, where the woman was shot and seriously wounded.

The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said. Matyas told WWMT-TV that the man did not resist when approached by law enforcement officers, and that weapons were found in his vehicle.

""The threat to the public is over,"" Matyas said.

Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree incomprehensible, according to Fox 17 Online.

Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city also is known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition of students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for more than a decade.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Airbus has designed bench seats that will accommodate air passengers of all shapes and sizes,[],"Passengers who struggle to fit into conventional seats may soon be able to sit comfortably after aircraft maker Airbub submitted a patent for a new bench-style seat.

The French company has submitted a patent for a Re-configurable Passenger Bench Seat with adjustable chairs and seatbelts which will allow airlines to accommodate people of all different shapes and sizes.

It could help airlines deal with the increasing number of larger passengers taking to the skies and may also reduce prices for families who currently have to pay for a full price seat once kids are over two-years-old The Mirror reported.

Some smaller airlines charge passengers by their weight and others are adding larger seats.

Airbus has submitted a range of drawings to the US patent office illustrating how the seat can be configured in a range of different ways.

The aircraft cabin layout, particularly of the passenger seats should be as flexible as possible and easily reconfigurable.

In addition, efforts are made to design the passenger cabin of a commercial aircraft in such a way that flexible adaptation of the cabin layout to the requirements of specific user groups, such as, for example, families with small children, senior citizens, people with restricted mobility, etc, Airbus said in its patent application.

The illustrations show three different bench configurations, reports the Daily Post.

The first offer more room for two passengers which may suit a business class cabin or provide room for passengers who require increased space such as, for example, overweight passengers or passengers with restricted mobility.

The second version gives an example of how three economy class passengers who do not need extra space can share the bench.

The third configuration shows that the seat provides enough space for a family of two adults with two small children sitting in between them.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,"What do Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney share? Both are victims of a left-wing smear machine",['Fred Fleitz'],"This week, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) named my organization, the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a hate group because of our work highlighting the threat from radical Islam. CSP will join other conservative groups such the Family Research Council, Liberty Counsel and WorldNetDaily, all of which SPLC has smeared by listing them alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.

The SPLC is best known for its work decades ago fighting legal battles against segregation in the South. But it long ago morphed into a far left group with one purpose: manufacturing material to slander conservatives for use by the news media and on the Internet.

CSP President Frank Gaffney has been on another SPLC hate list for several years along with American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), Robert Spencer (the founder of director of Jihad Watch blog), Lt. Gen. William Jerry Boykin (executive vice president of the Family Research Council), WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah and other conservatives. Joining them on this list are an assortment of neo-Nazis, KKK members and white supremacists.

Dr. Ben Carson was placed on a SPLC extremist watch list in 2014 because of statements he made in defense of traditional marriage. But after a public outcry, the SPLC was forced to withdraw this designation and issue an apology to Carson in February 2015.

Among the many false claims in the SPLCs new list of hate groups is that Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy have been banned from participating in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and that Gaffneys banishment from CPAC probably earns him points with Trump.

Although CPAC and the Center have had some differences in the past, this is no longer the case. Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC last year and will have an expanded presence in 2016.

I will be speaking at CPAC 2016 conference next month on behalf of the Center on the Iranian and North Korean missile programs.

To show how sloppy the SPLCs research is, a 2015 SPLC report noted that Gaffney and the Center were present at CPACs 2015 conference and that the Center was a sponsor.

As ridiculous as the SPLC hate lists may sound, they often are taken seriously by the liberal media. These lists almost had deadly consequences in 2012 when Floyd Corkins, a volunteer at a gay-rights group, entered the office lobby of the Family Research Council with the intention of killing as many of the Councils employees as possible because of the organizations opposition to same-sex marriage.

Corkins shot and injured a building manager before he was disarmed. He decided to launch a killing spree against the Family Research Council and another conservative organization after he read about their opposition to gay marriage in the SPLCs hate lists.

While SPLC regularly lumps conservatives with neo-nazis and white supremacists for being anti-gay, anti-immigrant, Islamophobes, white nationalists or for miscellaneous hate (such disbelieving in global warming), it refuses to put liberal individuals and groups on their hate lists.

For example, the SPLC had nothing to say last summer when left wing groups like MoveOn.org, the Daily Kos, Credo and the National Iranian American Council attacked Jewish congressmen who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) by questioning their loyalty to this country.

Elliot Abrams decried this bigotry in an August 10, 2015 article in The Weekly Standard:

The basic idea is simple: to oppose the presidents Iran deal means you want war with Iran, youre an Israeli agent, you are in the pay of Jewish donors, and you are abandoning the best interests of the United States. So Dan Pfeiffer, senior political adviser to Obama until this winter, tweeted that Senator Charles Schumerwho announced his opposition to the Iran deal last weekshould not be Democratic leader in the Senate because he wants War with Iran.

SPLC also has been silent on a growing anti-Semitism on the left and how American colleges are ignoring violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States.

On the other hand, the SPLC has joined President Obama in jumping on the fraudulent Islamophobia bandwagon. Thats why CSP and Gaffney caught its attention.

I join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group.

The Islamophobia charges made against CSP and other critics of radical Islam have nothing to do with hate or bigotry  they are a ploy by Mr. Obama, American Muslim groups and liberal groups to sidestep how Islamist extremism represents, as American Islamic Forum for Democracy President Zuhdi Jasser has put it, a problem within the house of Islam.

This problem is the global jihad movement which is an ideology at war not just with modern society but also with the majority of the worlds Muslims.

This is the real hate: Islamic supremacists cloaking their intolerance and hatred towards anyone who rejects their extremism  Muslims and non-Muslims  as protected religious practice. This hate includes brutalizing and killing groups that the SPLC claims to protect: women, LGBT individuals and racial and ethnic minorities.

The SPLC designated Frank Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy as haters because of our work to publicize the threat posed by to the supremacist Islamic shariah doctrine, a threat that President Obama and liberal groups refuse to confront or even name. They are in denial about this threat and instead condemn as bigots anyone who tries to address it.

This was crystal clear when President Obama on February 3 visited a mosque in Baltimore with known terrorist ties but refuses to meet with Muslims like Dr. Jasser who is leading an Islam reform movement that rejects Islamist radicalism and ISIS.

American leftwing groups like SPLC have also stubbornly ignored flagrantly hateful statements by some American Muslim groups.

There was a glaring example of this after the San Bernardino shooting when Hussam Ayloush, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told CNNs New Day, some of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism. ... We are partly responsible.

In May 2004, Ayloush said the U.S. war on terror was a war on Muslims, adding his belief that the 9/11 attacks were committed because of the U.S.s unconditional support of Israel. The U.S. is Israels partner in crime against the Palestinians, Ayloush explained.

How can a supposed civil rights organization like the SPLC give Ayloush and CAIR a pass on such hateful statements and actions?

How can it not speak out against growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States?

One reason is that the SPLC is not a civil rights organization  it is a far left advocacy group that tries to discredit its political enemies on the right with incoherent hate lists that wrongly associate them with notorious bigots to advance a liberal agenda. This is consistent with #12 of Saul Alinskys ""Rules for Radicals"": Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.

SPLC also demonized conservatives with bogus hate charges because it has found this kind of fearmongering to be very lucrative. According to the SPLCs 2014 tax return, this non-profit organization had $54 million in revenue and $315 million in assets.

Back in 2000, an investigative report into the SPLCs activities was published by Harpers Magazine titled The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance. It described the SPLC and its activities as essentially a fraud that shuts down debate, stifles free speech, and most of all, raises a pile of money, very little of which is used on behalf of poor people.

Perhaps the main reason the SPLC has been able to raise such huge sums because its president, Morris Dees, is so skilled at using scare mongering mailings for fund raising that in 1998 he was inducted into the Direct Mailing Association Hall of Fame.

Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.

The author of this article asked, What I'm very curious to learn is how keeping hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in assets, several offshore bank accounts and part ownership in foreign financial firms in any substantive way addresses poverty in America.

I believe the SPLCs new focus on Islamophobia is because the organization has identified attacking critics of radical Islam as the ultimate money pot. For example, Saleh Abdulla Kamel, a Saudi banker believed to have been a financer of Usama bin Laden, gave $10 million to Yale University in 2015 to build an Islamic law center.

Given the SPLCs lack of scruples, greed and offshore operations, I believe it is very likely that this group is receiving funding from Gulf state billionaires like Kamel to discredit anyone who criticizes radical Islam and the global jihad movement.

The news media must stop being manipulated by the SPLCs calumny of its political enemies.

Reporters should realize that an organization which attacks all critics of radical Islam as Islamophobes, refuses to mention the extremism and intolerance of radical Islamist groups, and is silent on the growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish university students cannot be considered a neutral and authoritative source.

The media also needs recognize that the SPLCs hate lists which lump Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney, Cliff Kinkaid and organizations like the Family Resource Council, WorldNet Daily and the Center for Security Policy with neo-Nazis and white supremacists are utter nonsense.

The press should instead be investigating the SPLCs enormous wealth, anonymous funders and how it is poisoning the public debate in this country to advance a liberal agenda and to enrich itself.

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,"Nevada Caucus: Sanders, Clinton make final push for Latino support",['Bryan Llenas'],"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are running a tight race Saturday in the Nevada Democratic caucuses. Early entrance-polls have Sanders winning the Hispanic vote at 54% to Clinton's 43%.

It should be noted that Sanders pushed hard for young Latino voters in Nevada, whereas Clinton worked to appeal to Latina moms.

Latino turnout in Nevada caucus could decide the Democratic race today. The state is the first substantial test of candidates' support with Hispanic voters in this election.

Nearly 1 in 5 voters in Nevada is Hispanic, according to the Pew Research Center, and Latino voter turnout could decide who wins whats expected to be a tight Nevada caucus race.

The Hillary Clinton campaign has been on the ground in Nevada since April, and part of their strategy has been reaching out to Latina women  mothers and wives. The Bernie Sanders campaign got started late in Nevada but they are riding momentum and enthusiasm from young Latinos, particularly young undocumented immigrants or DREAMers.

Though, they cant vote. DREAMers are volunteering for the campaign and encouraging young voters to caucus. A Sanders win in Nevada will likely hinge on whether young Latinos show up to caucus in a state where 44% of Latino voters are millennials, according to Pew.



How the Nevada presidential caucuses work

Here's how the Nevada caucuses work and a little history about the event, which happens for Democrats on Saturday and for Republicans on Feb. 23.

___

HOW IT STARTED

Eleven states applied to the Democratic National Committee in 2006 for early-state status. Nevada's delegation pitched the state as a reflection of the country's changing population and it sure didn't hurt that Harry Reid, the highest-ranking Democratic senator, lobbied for his home state.

Ultimately, Nevada and South Carolina won out over Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Washington, D.C., Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, West Virginia and Hawaii.

""We're now having a caucus here on Saturday in a state that's representative of what America is,"" Reid said.

More representative than mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, for sure, but not spot on with the nation. About one-quarter of Nevada's population is Hispanic, and one-quarter of South Carolina's is black. The U.S. population is less diverse: 12.4 percent black, 17.4 percent Hispanic, 8.2 percent Asian or other minorities, and 62 percent non-Hispanic white.

Nevada is a swing state, with a slight Democratic registration advantage but a Republican-dominated state government.

___

HOW IT WORKS

Unlike a primary, which involves quick and solitary voting, caucuses generally involve a more public pronouncement of presidential preference. Caucus-goers mainly meet in schools, community centers and places of worship in Nevada's 17 counties, and give speeches to try to persuade their undecided neighbors.

Democrats have divided the state into about 1,700 precincts meeting at more than 200 caucus sites. Six are at Las Vegas Strip casinos so housekeepers, blackjack dealers and others with weekend schedules can attend. Republicans have more than 1,700 precincts and more than 130 caucus locations.

The late-morning Democratic caucuses are third in line for the party; the weeknight Republican caucuses are fourth for the GOP, behind South Carolina on Saturday.

___

FOR DEMOCRATS

Nevadans don't need to be registered as Democrats  or registered at all  before coming to the caucus. The same-day sign-up option helped the party register 30,000 new Democratic voters in 2008.

Caucus-goers break into groups that declare their support for a candidate. If the number of people in any group is under 15 percent of the total at the caucus, they can either choose not to participate or join another candidate group.

The caucus is advertised as starting at 11 a.m., although people can participate as long as they get in line by noon. And they are expected to end by early afternoon, though there is not a set time.

The results are the first step in determining delegates who are expected to support candidates at the national convention. Democrats will send a total of 43 delegates to the national convention, but only 23 are directly tied to the results of the Saturday caucus.

Eight Democratic party leaders and elected officials are ""superdelegates"" and can vote for any candidate they like at the national convention. Three declared for Hillary Clinton, one for Bernie Sanders and four haven't said.

An additional 12 delegates are ""at large"" and will be decided by a vote at the state convention.

___

FOR REPUBLICANS

Republicans must register 10 days in advance of the caucus.

Their process is simpler: They'll mark their favorite candidate on a ballot, and don't necessarily need to stick around for speeches.

GOP caucuses must start any time after 5 p.m. and end before 9 p.m.

Nevada sends 30 delegates to the Republican National Convention, and they're awarded proportionally based on how each candidate performs Feb. 23.

___

IS NEVADA A BELLWETHER?

In the short history of early and contested Nevada caucuses, voters favored two nomination losers (Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney in 2008) and one winner (Romney in 2012).

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,The 3 strangest jobs in the world,"['Peter Swanson', 'Aol Staff']","Sometimes job hunting can make you pine for careers you never considered before. Six months of rejection emails can get you thinking, ""Maybe I'll just join the circus."" And despite what your mother thinks, that's actually not the worst or most far-out job you could take. If you think you've got it weird at work, there's a whole world of strange jobs waiting for you. We found some really weird ones, and maybe you'll be inspired to find the career you never knew you wanted.

(Photo Credit: neetalparekh/Flickr)

Inspired by the collections already online, we rounded up some of what we thought were the truly strangest jobs you can hold these days. If you're looking for a real challenge: find the college degree that best gets you prepared for each one!

1. Professional Cuddler

If you're looking for a job that gets you close to your customers, then look no further than the, er, cuddling industry. Professional cuddlers, as it were, are people who quite literally cuddle their paying customers on an hourly basis. It's a mostly in-home solo service that provides emotional intimacy for clients if not physical.

Sounds like a lot of wasted time? This expose on the world of professional cuddling by Mic shows that it is indeed lucrative: one pro cuddle-bug reported $80/hour rates, while another service boasted bringing in $100,000 per year. Yes, $8K, every month, for snuggling.

If physical touch is your thing, but prostitution isn't, you may have found your niche.

2. Professional Pusher

Sure, mom can be a nudge from time to time, but even the pushiest parents are no match for Japan's Oshiya. They are effectively professional pushers: people who are meant to corral passengers on to the busy, over-packed subways around Tokyo.

According to CNN, these workers don white gloves and uniforms, and expertly pack even the fullest subway car to capacity, ensuring that as many people as possible can catch their train on time. Thankfully, Thrillist was able to dig up a video of them in action.

3. Professional Smeller

Alas, no country  not even China  is immune to wonky health crazes. And this may be the king of them all: according to an article by Gizmodo, there are real people in China who are making roughly $50,000 each year by smelling and analyzing human flatulence.

The idea is that, much like a good sommelier, these expert noses can dissect the finer notes of bodily gasses to determine health issues that could arise in the patient. This author will kindly stick to the annual checkup with his MD.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,'We walk with Hillary': Why an L.A. congressman tells voters -- in 2 languages -- to caucus,"['Sarah D', 'Los Angeles Times']","Xavier Becerra could be spending time at home with his daughter in Los Angeles, in the congressional district he has represented for 23 years. He could be in Washington preparing for the next meeting of House Democrats or raising money for colleagues.

But instead he's here in Las Vegas, traveling from union halls to drab campaign phone bank centers to convince voters that Hillary Clinton should be the next president of the United States.

As he makes the rounds for Clinton, speaking to voters in both English and Spanish, he is also laying the groundwork for his own second act.

Hes one of the most prominent Latinos in Congress, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and running for a 13th term. But his opportunities to move up in the House leadership are limited unless someone retires or steps down.

I dont know what might happen, he said, but Im not going to be caught flat-footed.

That is at least one of the reasons he devoted 36 hours here last weekend to walk the streets of Nevada speaking to potential caucus-goers, and picking up the phone to make a pitch for Clinton.

In a state that is 28% Latino and critical to Clinton's closer-than-expected battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Becerra is a valuable stand-in for the former Secretary of State  an affable Spanish-speaking politician able to connect with voters as a big city congressman who was the first in his family to attend college.

And he knows as well as anyone that, if Team Clinton prevails in the election, there could be a reward for his grassroots efforts.

Becerra has quietly stumped for Clinton across five states since endorsing her in August. He has devoted six weekends, acting as a surrogate on local television and telling people in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina why they should vote for the woman hes known for nearly 25 years. (He doesnt mention that, when Clinton battled Barack Obama for the nomination eight years ago, he was on Obamas side.)

On the trail last weekend, in advance of this Saturdays caucuses, Becerra was leaning against a railing, holding an Iron Workers for Hillary sign as Clinton addressed cheering union members representing iron workers, bricklayers and teachers.

THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE when a California congressman campaigns in Nevada >>

The setting was a union hall in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson. A folding wall has been opened to create more space as organizers tried to fit in more union members who had been waiting  some since dawn  in a line that wrapped the building.

Hill-Yes! one woman yelled. Others waved signs reading Estoy Contigo, or ""Im With You"" in Spanish.

U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) campaigns for Hillary Clinton in Nevada.

Becerra nodded when Clinton briefly thanked him onstage. Photographers and others trying to get a better view of the candidate pushed by, not recognizing him.

After the speech, Clinton lingered to shake hands and talk to the crowd.

Becerra rushed in the opposite direction to talk Clinton up to the local and national press in the back of the room. It's less glamorous than commanding the stage, but critical to her potential success.

Becerra has been in this position before.

His 2008 endorsement of Obama led to an offer to join that administration as U.S. trade representative. But Becerra turned that down, suggesting he was worried trade wouldn't be a major focus of the administration. (The Obama administration wasn't pleased the congressman took weeks to make up his mind.)

Last year, he contemplated running for retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer's seat, but decided to stay in the House despite an uncertain path to power there.

He has less than a year left in his term as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, but if he hopes to be the first Latino House leader, he'll have to wait. Democratic matriarch Nancy Pelosi, 75, has given no indication about when she will retire, and her No. 2, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, 76, is expected to move into that job once she does.

That leaves Becerra, 58, with some choices. In 2018, if Sen. Dianne Feinstein retires, he could pursue the seat she has held for 23 years. Or ask to be placed on the powerful House Budget Committee. Or perhaps there is a role for him should Clinton become the party nominee.

He wants to do more in federal politics, but isnt focused on a particular job, he said. He's heard speculation he could be a vice presidential pick, but declines to speculate himself.

Shame on me if I dont try to do more with what I have. It would be ... a terrible thing to waste this opportunity to try to make a difference, he said. ""Im closer to my final year doing this work than I am to my first year. I want to make a difference, and there are so many ways.""

Becerra hosts fundraisers and dinners with colleagues and supporters during the Washington work week and campaigns for local candidates around stumping for Clinton. On Sunday, he traveled to Houston to campaign for Democratic Rep. Gene Green.

FOXs Alex Hein explains:

[audio:http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/ak.podcast.foxnewsradio.com/news/housecallforhealth/HOUSECALLFORHEALTH_02-16-2016-ad.mp3]

Scientists have always been perplexed by the variability and origin of a persons tickle response. While some start giggling at the mere sight of wriggly fingers, others can sustain a feather caressing the toes without even cracking a smile.

One Neuroscientist explained to the Wall Street Journal whether the childlike response is learned or innate, and why it is almost impossible to tickle oneself.

While some argue that being ticklish is a defensive reflex against attack, Dr. David Linden explained in the report that he isnt sold.

While some ticklish parts of the body may be vulnerable in battle, others like toes wouldnt result in a mortal wound if struck. Linden compared being ticklish to having an itch, which experts believe evolved as a protective measure against infestation by insects or worms.

Linden told the Journal that it could be a clue that the tickle is a response to some sort of reflex gone awry.

He further concluded that there are no contextual or social reasons why most people are less ticklish as they get older, and that it is both learned and innate.

Twenty Orinoco crocodiles (Crocodylus intermedius) were reintroduced into El Tuparro Natural National Park this month, a site where an additional 21 crocodiles were released back in May 2015, the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement. All the crocodiles will be carrying radio transmitters to track their movements and monitor their adaptation to their natural environment.

Over the past few decades, he appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies before earning fame as Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk in the Avengers movie series.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.","['ago', 'younger', 'months', 'clinton', 'trump', 'contest', 'carolina', 'voters', 'looking', 'won', 'weeks', 'america', 'south', 'women']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Venezuela struggling to combat Zika amid shortages and information blackout,[],"This is what the Zika outbreak looks like in Venezuela, a country whose medical system has teetered for months on the brink of collapse:

There's a lack of bug spray to prevent mosquito bites, scant contraceptives to avert pregnancies, little medicine to treat Zika-linked maladies. There has been no effective public health campaign to inform the public about the disease  and nobody really knows how many infections there have been.

""It's just terrible what we are living,"" said Carla Natera, a 50-year-old local government worker who contracted Zika and spent three days searching pharmacies for an ointment to calm the angry rash that broke out on her face and body.

William Barrientos, a doctor and opposition lawmaker, says the socialist government is not equipped to confront a health crisis in a country where food and medicine shortages are acute, the economy is a shambles and a political crisis deepens by the day.

""There is no education and information campaign among the population here,"" and no tracking of the mosquitoes that carry the virus, he said.

The scale of what Venezuela is going through is unclear. Officials alerted the World Health Organization to the first case of Zika here in November but did not release statistics or reach out to the public until two months later.

The Health Ministry is now reporting more than 5,000 suspected Zika cases and three related deaths.

But a network of independent physicians allied with the opposition  the Venezuelan Society of Public Health  says that's likely a dramatic underestimate. It says a polling of local health officials found a rise in acute fevers that could correspond to 400,000 Zika cases, and the outbreak will likely reach its peak around the end of March.

Neighboring Colombia, by contrast, has reported more than 30,000 cases.

It's been a year since the government published up-to-date epidemiological data and reaching the Health Ministry for information is frustrating. The main line for hits ""Zika situation room"" was out of order Tuesday and the person answering another number for the room hung up twice on a reporter.

To compensate for the lack of official figures, doctors have been turning to informal surveys, social media and even Google analytics to try to get a handle on the scope of the outbreak.

The virus has been linked to a spike in Guillain-Barre, a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks the nervous system, causing temporary paralysis that can be fatal. Health officials say the country has seen 255 cases of the Guillain-Barre syndrome since the Zika outbreak began  a much higher incidence than reported in other countries grappling with the virus.

""Normally, we'd expect 30 or 40 cases of Guillain-Barre a month,"" said former health minister Jose Felix Oletta. ""What this shows is that the minister has the total number of Zika cases wrong. It's much higher.""

Venezuela's medical shortages could easily boost the mortality rate for Guillia-Barre, which is about 5 percent in developed countries. Nancy Pino, a 68-year-old retired school administrator, died last month of Guillain-Barre that developed after she fell ill over Christmas with symptoms of Zika.

Doctors said the woman from the lowland state of Anzoategui needed intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and sent her three children on a frantic two-week search for the medicine after they rushed her to Caracas.

As the family begged for immunoglobulin at state agencies, on local television channels and even at the presidential palace, their mother lost the ability to walk, speak, open her eyes and, finally, to breathe.

""They shut the doors on us. There's just not medicine here,"" daughter Nehara Ramos said.

The country's private, opposition-leaning pharmaceutical association says Venezuela only has 20 percent of the medications it requires, a result of currency and price controls.

The government blames the shortages on ""economic war"" waged by its right-wing opponents.

Earlier this month, Health Minister Luisana Melo invited sick Venezuelans to email requests for medicine to a state-run Gmail account. Last week, President Nicolas Maduro said the country had received a special shipment of drugs that will be sufficient to combat Zika, but did not specify what the shipment included.

The Health Ministry is advising the public to use bug spray, an item all but impossible to come by in Venezuela these days, and to clean out their tubs of standing water once a week. That is a lot to ask, however, of the many Venezuelans keep tubs in their homes full of water to deal with chronic shortages.

Meanwhile, state media have been broadcasting a steady stream of footage of health officials accompanying workers on mosquito fumigation and immunoglobulin distribution missions.

What they haven't been doing with any regularity is offering the public advice on how to behave.

Venezuelan officials say the country has not yet seen any cases of birth defects associated with Zika, as have been reported in Brazil.

Other countries have advised women to postpone pregnancy until the Zika epidemic has slowed. But in Venezuela, condoms and birth control pills are in extremely short supply, making it complicated for women to avoid pregnancy.

In the western state of Zulia, a focal point of the epidemic, local health authorities say 25 pregnant women have contracted Zika and are under medical observation.

Doctors are also complaining that laboratories have been unable to obtain the chemical needed to diagnose Zika by identifying the DNA of the virus. Doctors have to rely on a clinical diagnosis based only on symptoms.

""It's like flying by instruments,"" pediatrician Carolina Mirabal said.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,Keeping Soldiers and Their Pets Together,[],"One week before Kathleen and Drew Barton were deployed to Afghanistan in 2014, the Mays Landing, New Jersey, couple were still searching frantically for a temporary home for their two large dogs. Their original pet care plans had fallen through and they were desperate for a new solution.

All their family and friends had their own pets to take care of, and putting the dogs in a kennel was far too expensive.

Thankfully, I found PACT, or People, Animals, Companions, Together, said Kathleen Barton. I was blown away at the love and compassion they had for my dogs.

A nonprofit that helps military personnel find foster homes for their animals while they serve overseas, PACT was created by retired lawyer Buzz Miller. In less than 24 hours Miller found a temporary loving home for the Bartons two dogs, Sasha and Vada.

""They are risking their lives,"" Miller said about American military servicemen and women. ""Now, they have one less thing to worry about. And they get regular email updates about their dogs from the dogs foster parents.""

Miller founded PACT in 2010 out of his Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, home. He and his wife have been rescuing cats and dogs for years. They both volunteer at a local rescue. ""I remember seeing these big burly guys, about to be deployed, sitting on the floors of shelters crying their eyes out because they had to leave and had no alternatives for their pets. Most of these shelters were kill shelters.""

PACT started out locally and now helps military personnel all over the country.

Petra Torri was determined to find a temporary loving home for her mini Cocker Spaniel, Coco, and her Jack Russell Terrier, Bella. The Florida native has lived with Coco for 6 years and Bella for 7. She found PACT online.

""I was going to train at the Office of Military Intelligence and couldnt bring my dogs with me,"" she explained. ""My boyfriend is also in the Army, and he could be deployed during that time. My friends and family either have dogs or are serving in the military and cant foster. And pet sitters charge a lot for the seven- or eight-month period I would be training. It was too expensive.""

""Buzz (Miller) asked if I would fly my dogs up to Pennsylvania,"" said Torri. ""Within a day he put me in touch with Lorrie and Michael Manacchio, who agreed to foster my dogs.""

The Manacchios found out about PACT from a news segment on TV, and wanted to foster. They have two large dogs, Pluto, a 6-year-old Golden Retriever, and Gracie, a 10-year-old Chow mix.

""I was a bit concerned about leaving my small dogs in the company of a family with two large dogs,"" said Torri. ""Buzz assured me he checks out the homes of every foster family, and would never put a dog in a dangerous situation. In fact, they dont work with aggressive dogs.""

Torri also liked the fact that Michael Manacchio is a veteran. ""I spoke to Michael, and since he served in the military, he understood the stress I was feeling about leaving my dogs behind,"" she said. ""He assured me that he and his wife, Lorrie, would take good care of Coco and Gracie.""

The Manacchios took the day off from work when Torri, Coco, and Gracie arrived in Pennsylvania. ""I wanted to be here to meet Petra, Coco, and Gracie,"" said Lorrie Manacchio, who works for a pharmaceutical company, as does her husband. ""Buzz was concerned Michael and I work full time. He wanted to make sure someone would be here to watch and take care of the dogs while we were at work.""

Lorrie Manacchio's 83-year-old father, also a veteran, lives nearby and comes up every day for breakfast and lunch to walk the dogs and spend time with them. ""He has a standard Poodle, and when he retired from teaching, he became a dog trainer,"" said his daughter.

Torri could tell that all of the dogs got along well from the photos and e-mails the Manacchios sent her. In some of the photos, the dogs were taking turns sitting on Lorries lap lounging on an inner tube while floating in the Manacchios pool. Other photos showed the dogs playing with toys and balls.

""We now feel like our family has expanded, thanks to PACT,"" said Lorrie Manacchio.

PACT doesnt charge for its services. However, the group asks pet owners to provide enough money for veterinary care. Often the host family pays for pet food, and all pets in the program must be spayed or neutered.

Buzz Miller doesnt take kindly to people who give up their cats, dogs, birds, or other animals because of a move, a divorce, or tiring of caring for their pets. ""Adopting a pet is a commitment,"" he explained. ""You just cant toss aside a family member. People in the military often have no other choice.""

Miller also spends time looking for funds to help defray the operating costs for his small staff. PACT has received grants from Petco, Banfield, and the Dreyfus Foundation.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that pioneers tech for the US military, created the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program. Oregon-based company Leidos is working with the agency to develop the groundbreaking ship.

On Tuesday DARPA tweeted a picture of ACTUV being prepared for sea trials in the spring.

From concept: https://t.co/A2buvNq9DP to prototype -- this is ACTUV today, being prepped for sea trials this spring. pic.twitter.com/CsNQYmVl6S  DARPA (@DARPA) February 16, 2016

Without a human crew, this drone vessel will be able to execute important missions independently like tracking and trailing an enemy sub over thousands of miles  not just for a day or two, or even a few weeks  this drone could hunt the enemy for months.

Related: Drone swarms join the Navy

The ACTUV enemy submarine hunter is expected to be about 130 feet long. DARPA has announced that it will be revealed for the first time on April 7 when it will also be christened in Portland, Oregon.

In addition to hunting enemy subs, ACTUV will be capable of a wide range of missions, such as reconnaissance and counter-mine deployments. It could also be useful to resupply troops.

Whats the threat?

The rise of tough-to-detect and track diesel electric submarines poses a significant challenge to the U.S. Navy. ACTUV is designed to excel at tracking these ultra-quiet subs.

Diesel-electric submarines come at a relatively cheap price point of about $250 million, while giving their owners the advantage of stealthy movements beneath the surface due to their virtually silent engines.

Related: Historic aircraft carriers in pictures

How quiet is quiet? Reports suggest that some of these subs can be 15 decibels more quiet than a humpback whale.

Iran claims to have fleets of these sneaky subs.

How ACTUV will be a game changer

Enter ACTUV, which could roam the oceans for thousands and thousands of miles executing missions.

For next level tracking, the vessel will be armed with state-of-the art sensors allowing it to detect the quietest of enemy subs. The idea is that it will be nearly impossible for a hostile sub to slip the ACTUV when the unmanned vessel is on its tail.

Despite being smaller than traditional subs, the ACTUV will be able to achieve speeds that exceed diesel electric propulsion submarines - and for a fraction of the cost.

ACTUV will have logic that allows it to not just identify other vessels, but also predict how they will behave. The sub hunter will be so smart that it should be able to interact, counter and outmaneuver manned enemy vessels.

It will be able to run operations as part of a team with other unmanned vessels operating beneath the water and on the surface. The sub hunter could also work in cooperation with manned vessels.

And get this  ACTUV is designed to figure out and comply with maritime laws, such as regulations to prevent collisions.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

When ACTUV enters service, it will give the U.S. military a range of advantages. Rather than send out a destroyer or a nuclear sub, ACTUV could be deployed, freeing up those assets and keeping costs down.

ACTUV will offer lots of versatility, such as launching from and returning to a pier  rather than having to deploy from a ship like other UUVs (Unmanned Underwater Vehicles). ACTUV will also give the Navy a vessel with far better endurance. It will also be able to carry far more weight than lots of the drone surface vessels launched from ships.

Whats Next?

After the big reveal in April, ACTUV will continue to be tested and refined.

Cliven Bundy and four others were indicted on 16 charges, including conspiracy and weapons violations.

The charges stem from an armed standoff two years ago on federal land in Nevada over unpaid grazing fees. That incident is separate from the recent occupation of an Oregon Wildlife Refuge that ended earlier this month.

Ammon Bundy, who led the latest occupation, was also indicted in the 2014 case. Cliven Bundys attorney says the governments charges are not proof a crime was committed.

Federal prosecutors say attempts to use force against officers of the law should be punished. A court date for arraignment has not been set.

Experts from Binghamton University studied hundreds of ancient items found on the shores of Easter Island, which is also known as Rapa Nui. Previously, the artifacts were thought to be spear points, but analysis reveals that they were likely general purpose tools.

Carved from obsidian, or volcanic glass, thousands of the triangular objects, known as mata'a, litter the surface of the island.

We found that when you look at the shape of these things, they just don't look like weapons at all,"" explained Carl Lipo, professor of anthropology at Binghamton University and study lead, in a press release. ""When you can compare them to European weapons or weapons found anywhere around the world when there are actually objects used for warfare, they're very systematic in their shape. They have to do their job really well. Not doing well is risking death.""

Lipo and his team analyzed ""the shape variability"" of a photo set of over 400 mata'a.

""You can always use something as a spear. Anything that you have can be a weapon, said Lipo. But under the conditions of warfare, weapons are going to have performance characteristics. And they're going to be very carefully fashioned for that purpose because it matters...You would cut somebody [with a mata'a], but they certainly wouldn't be lethal in any way.""

Some scientists have estimated, that, at its height, Easter Islands population may have been as high as 20,000, but fell over centuries after the islands trees and palms were cut down to build canoes and transport its famous giant statues. One theory suggests that the deforestation led to soil erosion, impacting the islands ability to support wildlife and farming, and the collapse of its civilization.

When the Dutch arrived at the island in 1722, its population was 3,000 or less. Only 111 inhabitants were living on Easter Island by 1877.

Other experts, however, have questioned whether Easter Island ever supported a large population, citing instead the arrival of Europeans, who brought diseases and took islanders away as slaves.

foxnews,2016-02-12 00:00:00,"Neanderthal-human trysts may be linked to modern depression, heart disease",[],"Ancient trysts between Neanderthals and modern humans may have influenced modern risks for depression, heart attacks, nicotine addiction, obesity and other health problems, researchers said.

The Neanderthals were once the closest relatives of modern humans. Scientists recently discovered that Neanderthals and modern humans once interbred; nowadays, about 1.5 to 2.1 percent of DNA in people outside Africa is Neanderthal in origin.

""This raises several fascinating questions like, 'What effect does the Neanderthal DNA that remains in modern humans have on our biology?'"" said study senior author John Capra, an evolutionary geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. [See Photos of Our Closest Human Ancestor]

Now, for the first time, researchers have directly compared Neanderthal DNA with the clinical records of a significant portion of adults of European ancestry. The scientists discovered that this archaic genetic legacy has had a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology, they said.

""Neanderthal DNA influences a broad range of traits relevant to disease risk in modern humans,"" Capra told Live Science.

The researchers first identified about 135,000 Neanderthal genetic variations found in modern humans. Next, the scientists analyzed a database of more than 28,000 adults of European ancestry from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a consortium of nine hospitals across the United States. This data linked patient genetic data with versions of those individuals' electronic health records that were stripped of identifying details such as names and addresses.

The data helped the researchers determine if each person had ever been treated for medical conditions such as heart disease, arthritis and depression. It also helped the scientists determine what Neanderthal genetic variants each person carried.

Ultimately, the researchers found that Neanderthal genetic variants were significantly linked to increased risk of 12 traits, including heart attack and artery thickening.

Surprisingly, the investigators also found a Neanderthal genetic variant that significantly increased the modern human risk for nicotine addiction, the researchers said. However, this does not mean that Neanderthals smoked tobacco, Capra said.

""Tobacco was found solely in the Western Hemisphere until Europeans brought it back from expeditions to the Americas,"" Capra said. The Neanderthal DNA that boosts the risk of nicotine addiction may have had a completely different and potentially beneficial effect ""that exhibited itself 50,000 years ago,"" Capra said.

Some of the scientists' discoveries confirm previous ideas. For example, earlier research suggested that Neanderthal DNA influenced skin cells known as keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and germs. The new findings suggest that Neanderthal genetic variants increase the risk of developing sun-triggered skin lesions known as keratoses, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes.

""When we started this study, we expected that if we found anything at all, we would find an influence of Neanderthal DNA on bodily systems that are involved in interactions with the environment,"" Capra said. ""We hypothesized this because Neanderthals had been living in Central Asia and Europe for hundreds of thousands of years before our recent ancestors ever reached these areas  and thus had likely adapted to the distinct environmental aspects of these regions, compared to Africa, in terms of climate, plants and animals, and pathogens.""

Capra and his colleagues also found that a number of Neanderthal genetic variants influenced the risk for depression, with some variants increasing the risk and others reducing it.

""The brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,"" study lead author Corinne Simonti, a graduate student of human genetics at Vanderbilt University, said in a statement.""

The researchers suggest that some Neanderthal genetic variants might have provided benefits in modern human populations as they first moved out of Africa thousands of years ago. However, those variants may have later become detrimental in modern, Western environments, the scientists said. One example is Neanderthal DNA that increases blood clotting; while this can help seal wounds and prevent germs from entering the body, it can also increase the risk for stroke, miscarriage and other problems, Capra said.

The researchers suggest that Neanderthal DNA may not have contributed to differences in skin colors between modern humans, unlike what previous research has suggested. Instead, differences in modern human skin color probably developed very recently, Capra said. ""Neanderthals may also have had a range of skin colors,"" Capra added.

Future research can compare Neanderthal DNA with data gleaned from other sources of medical information, such as lab tests, doctors' notes and medical images, the researchers said. ""There is still much to learn about the effects of interbreeding on different populations in recent human history,"" Capra said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Feb. 11 in the journal Science.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Giant dinosaur had 2 tumors on its tailbone,[],"It's fairly common to discover dinosaur remains scratched with ancient claw or bite marks, but finding fossils with signs of tumors is rare.

And now scientists have found not one but two different types of tumor on the same bone  the vertebra of a titanosaur, a gigantic long-necked, long-tailed paleo beast, a new study finds.

""Finding any disease in fossils is rare,"" said the study's lead researcher, Fernando Barbosa, a doctoral student of geology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. ""Cancer still is most rare because the majority of them do not leave signals in bones."" [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]

The finding is the first known case of a tumor in a dinosaur that isn't a duck-billed dinosaur, or hadrosaur, the researchers said.

The 7-inch-long fossilized vertebra, discovered in 2012 in Brazil's southern Sao Paulo state, belongs to a species in the Titanosauridae family, ""the most abundant Cretaceous dinosaur family of South America,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

However, the 90-million-year-old bone had an unusual appearance  a ""small bony button-shaped protuberance,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Curious, Barbosa and his colleagues decided to investigate the weird bump, which measured just 0.3 by 0.3 inches.

They found evidence of two tumors, both benign, Barbosa said. One is an osteoma, a bone overgrowth, which the researchers confirmed with a computer tomography (CT) scan and an examination of the fossil's structure.

The other, a hemangioma, is a harmless vascular tumor.

""We were very lucky finding this because we didn't have any evidence of the hemangioma,"" Barbosa told Live Science in an email. ""It was diagnosed by [the CT scan], which was only possible because we were investigating the radiological appearance of the osteoma.""

The tumors, though examples of abnormal cell growth, should not be called cancer, he said. Usually, only harmful tumors are called cancer, and these tumors were benign, Barbosa said. Furthermore, because of the tumors' location and likely small sizes, the dinosaur probably didn't notice them, the researchers said.

It's not the first ancient animal to have an osteoma, the researchers said. The oldest known case of osteoma dates to the early Carboniferous (a period spanning 359.2 million to 299 million years ago) in the North American fish Phanerosteon mirabile. The mosasaur Platecarpus, a marine reptile, also had an osteoma, as did a crocodile, Leidyosuchus formidabilis, which lived during the Paleocene, a period spanning between 65 million and 56 million years ago.

The new finding shows that dinosaurs other than hadrosaurs developed tumors, Barbosa said. For instance, Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, Bactrosaurus and Edmontosaurus, all duck-billed dinosaurs, show evidence of hemangiomas, just like the titanosaur does. Various individuals from the genus Edmontosaurus also showed evidence of a desmoplastic fibroma (a rare bone tumor), an osteoblastoma (bone cancer) and a metastatic cancer (cancer that spreads throughout the body).

""We still need to find several other diseases in dinosaurs [and] other extinct animals, and understand why they were affected by them,"" Barbosa said.

The study will be published in the July issue of the journal Cretaceous Research.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Apollo 10 astronauts reported hearing odd 'music' on far side of moon,[],"The astronauts who flew the dress rehearsal for the first lunar landing reported hearing mysterious outer space-type music while flying behind the moon in May 1969.

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","['sound', 'noise', 'far', 'flew', 'young', 'astronauts', 'hearing', 'reported', 'nasa', 'music', 'module', 'apollo', 'odd', 'moon', 'stafford']"

The new study, published in the journal Nature, reports that genetic analysis of the remains of a Neanderthal woman detected residual DNA from Homo sapiens, a sign of inter-species mating.

The discovery by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology forces scientists to reasses the accepted timeline of when humans migrated out of Africa to other parts of the world.

One theory is that the recently discovered interbreeding arose from what scientists call a failed dispersal. That refers to a small population of Homo sapiens trekking to the Middle East and other parts of Eurasia, but failing to establish lasting colonies.

The remains of the Neanderthal woman at the center of the study were found in southern Siberia, near the border with present-day Mongolia.

We don't know what happened to them,"" geneticist Martin Kuhlwilm told Reuters. ""It seems likely that this population went extinct, either by environmental changes or maybe direct competition with Neanderthals ... It implies that modern humans left Africa in several waves, some of which probably went extinct.""

Neanderthals, renowned for their skill as hunters, lived in modern-day Europe and Asia. The last of them are believed to have died out approximately 40,000 years ago.

Last week, a study published in the journal Science presented evidence that one bit of Neanderthal DNA can boost the risk of tobacco addiction, while others can slightly raise or lower the risk of being diagnosed with depression. Past studies have suggested Neanderthal DNA raises the risk of allergies.

Neanderthals and modern people split off from each other on the evolutionary tree an estimated 600,000 years ago. In people of Asian or European ancestry, around 2 percent of DNA can be traced to Neanderthals.

On December 27, Kim checked in to the hospital where doctors discovered two brain tumors and diagnosed her with grade 4 glioblastoma, WTSP.com reported.

If it wasnt for the baby, she probably wouldve never gone to the hospital, Phil Vaillancourt, Kims husband, told WTSP.com. With her severe headache and nausea and she wouldve laid in bed thinking it was the flu, and she wouldve possibly not been here today. We definitely feel that God put that baby in her for a reason; pretty much to save her life.

Kim underwent emergency surgery at Buffalo General Medical Center to remove the tumors, but she cannot undergo radiation and chemotherapy due to the pregnancy. Dr. Ajay Abad of Roswell Park Cancer Institute told WTSP that without the treatment, the tumors will grow back within 8 to 12 weeks, and she likely only has six to eight months to live.

The baby gave me a chance. Ive got to give the baby a chance, Kim told the news station. For now, the plan is for Kim to have an MRI every two weeks to watch for tumors, and she will begin radiation and chemotherapy a few weeks after delivering her baby on May 16.

It is sort of a race against time, Abad told WTSP.

The rest of the family, which include Ryan, 12, Hailey, 11, Kamila, 10, Josie, 7, and Charlie, 6, are taking on more chores to help out as they try to process what is happening to Kim. Two of the children require homeschooling and Josie was born without arms or legs.

I know its happening for a reason. I just dont know what the reason is, Ryan told WTSP.

Kim wants to live long enough to see her kids graduate, get married and start their own lives, but patients with grade 4 glioblastoma are often given one year to live.

Im in one of two places, Kim told WTSP. I either get to stay with Phil and the kids and live a long life. Or I get to go home and be with Jesus. Im OK. [Phils] the one thats stuck holding everything and trying to juggle all of this craziness.

While the family is relying on prayer, the financial needs of five children and Kims medical bills are growing, and a friend has set up a GoFundMe account to fundraise.

Claire and Mark Timmins lost their son Mason to the disease two weeks before Christmas 2013, according to news.com.au. They had been storing photos of his last days on Earth in a box until the death of another British child, 2-year-old Faye Burdett on Valentines Day, prompted an outpouring of support for nationwide vaccination against meningitis B among children.

The BBC reported that Lee Booth, of Gasthead, started a petition for the vaccine after he said doctors deemed his daughter too old for it. The death of Faye, who isnt related to Booth, fueled support for the petition which had garnered more than 640,000 signatures and counting as of Monday morning. Because the number of petition signatures has surpassed 100,000, Parliament will consider the recommendation, the BBC reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, recommends that preteens, teens and young adults at an increased risk of meningococcal disease get vaccinated to protect against the serogroup B type.

The Timmins family said their decision to release photos of their late son was easy.

So many people responded through shock from [Fayes death], and so we thought if its going to make a difference we should use our photo (sic) as well, they said, according to news.com.au.

While Faye suffered from a rash prior to her death, Masons meningitis exhibited with vomiting. Twenty-four hours after the episode, Mason died at the hospital in his parents arms, news.com.au reported.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)2015 Getty Images

Citibank is planning to sell the consumer banking operations it has operated for a century in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia as South America's three biggest economies suffer a major downturn.

The New York-based bank said Friday in a statement that its decision was prompted by a desire to allocate resources where it can generate the best returns.

The decision to eliminate its services affects depositors in more than 50 cities in the three countries.

The slowing of China's economy has plunged all three into an economic down spiral with Brazil, the region's biggest economy, struggling to emerge from its deepest recession since the 1930s. Foreign banks have taken a hit in dollar terms as the country's currency has collapsed although profits overall continue to rise as a result of some of the world's highest interest rate.

Although much smaller, its business in Argentina is storied.

Citibank in 1914 opened its first foreign branch in Argentina, when it rivaled Canada as an emerging agricultural powerhouse, and lumbered through decades of dictatorship, hyperinflation and pot-banging protesters outside its downtown headquarters during the country's 2001 financial crisis when it was ordered to seize depositors' accounts and make emergency loans to the government.

Argentina's current problems, including inflation that's forecast to surge to 30 percent this year amid several years of stagnant growth, seem far more mundane by comparison. And after years of fighting over defaulted debt with leftist former President Cristina Fernandez, the doors seemed wide open under her successor, Mauricio Macri, a former businessman who has made attracting foreign investment a top priority.

Next month, President Barack Obama will become the first U.S. president to visit Buenos Aires since Bill Clinton.

Citibank said it would still continue servicing corporate clients in the three countries.

The bank in 2014 dropped consumer banking in 11 other Latin America nations.

Several of Citibank's top executives over the years have been culled from their operations in South America, including former chairmen John Reed, who was raised in Argentina and Brazil to expat parents and oversaw the global bank in the 1980s and 1990s.

foxnews,2015-09-04 00:00:00,Chef Masayoshi Takayama: From dishwasher to sushi master,['Ali Rosen'],"Sushi is so common today that its even in grocery stores. But 30 years ago, Americans had barely heard of this Japanese mainstay ... until a chef named Masayoshi Takayama brought more than spicy tuna and California rolls to the West Coast.

Takayama  his legions of fans know him simply as Masa  now owns the renowned sushi restaurant in New York City that bears his name. At Masa, the food isnt just a meal  its a dining experience, a place where customers can taste the master chefs artfully displayed rare foods. And rare doesn't come cheap; a couple can easily spend $1,500 there.

Masa says staying true to the art of sushi has been the key to his success.

His love of seafood began when he was a boy in Japan, working at his family's fish company right outside of Tokyo. Seeing it every day as a child made ""sashimi and sushi personal,"" he says, and it launched his love for the ingredients.

But Japanese tradition requires that sushi chefs go through a decades-long apprenticeship before they can earn the title of chef, and Masa took the traditional path, cleaning bathroom floors and washing dishes as an apprentice in some of Tokyo's finest restaurants.

More on this... Kitchen Superstars: Sushi master 'Masa' Takayama

He remembers having ""no money, no salary, just enough to survive and learn,"" and it took five years before he was even allowed in front of customers. But once he was, he knew there was no turning back. Working at the sushi counter is like a stage, like Broadway,"" he says.

Masa moved to Los Angeles in 1980, and seven years later he opened Ginza Sushi-ko, which became one of the city's most coveted reservations. The restaurant has been credited with the rise in sushis popularity not just in L.A., but throughout the U.S.

As his reputation grew, Masa moved to a larger space in Beverly Hills. But in 2004, after a call from acclaimed chef Thomas Keller, owner of French Laundry, Masa moved to New York. His restaurant on the East Coast quickly became as popular as the one hed owned in L.A., and in 2008it became the first Japanese restaurant in America to receive the culinary world's highest honor  three Michelin stars.

Today Masa is still evolving, from designing the dishware (he makes pottery, too) to opening restaurants from Las Vegas to Dubai.

""This is my passion and energy,"" he says. ""I don't want to stay in the same spot. I like to move always to something new, but still keep the Japanese technique, the Japanese flavor.""","['dishwasher', 'rare', 'working', 'masa', 'restaurant', 'sushi', 'moved', 'japanese', 'took', 'chef', 'york', 'master', 'takayama', 'masayoshi']"

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)

Pope Francis on Sunday urged Catholic leaders to show ""exemplary"" courage by not allowing executions this year, while expressing hope that eventually the death penalty will be abolished worldwide.

Francis told tourists and pilgrims in St. Peter's Square that ""the commandment 'do not kill' holds absolute value and applies to both the innocent and the guilty.""

He added that there is ""an ever more widespread opposition in public opinion to the death penalty, even only as an instrument of legitimate social defense.""

""I appeal to the conscience of those who govern so that international consensus is reached for the abolishment of the death penalty,"" the pope said. ""And I propose to all those among them who are Catholic to make a courageous and exemplary gesture: may no execution sentence be carried out in this Holy Year of Mercy.""

Francis is using the church's Holy Year, which runs through Nov. 20, to encourage efforts for more reconciliation and mercy in the world.

The pope is building on church teaching, laid out by St. John Paul II, that there's no justification for capital punishment.

""In effect, modern societies have the possibility to efficiently repress crime without taking away definitely the possibility to redeem oneself from those who committed"" the crime, Francis said.

The pope said ""even criminals hold the inviolable right to life"" given by God.

Francis called on all Christians and all those of good will to work not only to abolish capital punishment but also to improve prison conditions.

From the start of his papacy, he has expressed concern that inmates in jails and prisons should be treated with dignity. He has often visited prisons during his trips throughout Italy and abroad, including last week while in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

While the pope insists he doesn't interfere in the political sphere, he has also made clear people must follow what he calls a ""well-informed"" conscience, and that local bishops can give guidance to Catholics, including voters, on political issues.

She has decided to put her career in television on hold while she raises her three children. A variety of rotating co-hosts will take Hasselbecks seat until a replacement is named.

In a statement, Hasselbeck said, Oftentimes, the most difficult decisions are between two great things. Throughout my 14 years working in television, I have never experienced a more positive and thoughtful atmosphere than FOX News Channel, thanks to the strong leadership of (FOX News Chairman & CEO) Roger Ailes, who has created the best working environment a woman and mother could ask for. His understanding, compassion, and kindness was exemplified when I shared with him that I am entering into a season where I want to start my day with my children first, and he offered his blessing to do so. With a heart full of gratitude and the peace that God has given me, I am confident that this personal decision is the right one for our family, and we will be joining all of you watching Fox & Friends each morning as we get ready for school together.

In commenting on her announcement, Ailes said, Elisabeth and I discussed this at length over several weeks, and while I would love for her to continue here, I respect her incredibly difficult, yet deeply personal decision. She has been a great addition to the Fox & Friends franchise.

Since September 2013, Hasselbeck has been a co-host on the number one rated cable news morning program alongside Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade. During her tenure at FNC, Fox & Friends continued to eclipse the cable news competition in total viewers and Adults 25-54, and remained number one in basic cable during its 6-9AM timeslot.

Prior to joining FNC, Hasselbeck spent nearly a decade at The View, the ABC daytime talk show created by Barbara Walters and Bill Geddie. During that period, the program was ranked #11 on Forbes 30 of the Most Influential Women in Media and the co-hosts were chosen among TIMEs 100 Most Influential People in the World. She had also served as a contributor to ABCs Good Morning America. Additionally, Hasselbeck was a keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention in both 2004 and 2008, and has interviewed Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Sharks-Blues Preview,[],"Just as St. Louis reached what's arguably been its season pinnacle to date, the hockey gods went and took something major away.

It'll be at least four weeks before No. 2 scorer Alexander Steen sees the ice again, and life without a top forward begins Monday night against the visiting San Jose Sharks as the Blues try to extend their season-best winning streak.

That streak reached five with Saturday's 6-4 win in Arizona, and Steen had a huge impact despite barely stepping on the ice. Steen quickly recorded a goal and an assist in just over two minutes of ice time then skated off holding his left arm, officially landing on injured reserve with an upper-body injury.

""When our best all-around player goes down, there's a lot to shoulder,"" captain David Backes told the team's official website. ""Different guys stepped up and played bigger minutes with bigger responsibility and did a heck of a job.""

There's the consolation of getting goaltender Jake Allen back after sustaining a lower-body injury on Jan. 8 - he was activated Sunday - but that might only be an upgraded insurance policy given the way Brian Elliott has handled increased work. Granted, Elliott gave up four goals on 22 shots to the Coyotes, but he's gone 10-2-2 with a 1.70 goals-against average dating to Jan. 16.

One of those defeats came against the Sharks. St. Louis' last regulation loss came back on Feb. 4 to San Jose, going 6-0-1 since that 3-1 home loss. The Blues (35-17-9) have limited opponents to 12 goals in that time, and their penalty kill has gone 38 of 40 (95.0 percent) in nine games this month.

Offensively, the six-goal output matched a season high after topping out at two goals in nine of their last 12 games.

""You kept shaking your head and wondering if it was real,"" Backes said. ""(Arizona) had 12 goals in their last two (games), and I don't know if we had that many in the last eight or nine.

""It was a wild ride, but we found another way to get another win and five in a row is a good feeling. Different guys are stepping up all the time.""

Jaden Schwartz has been one of them with a goal in three straight games, and the forward has four goals and an assist in five games back from a fractured left ankle. The Blues are 10-2-0 with him on the ice this season.

San Jose (31-21-5) is out to bounce back from Friday's 5-2 loss in Carolina and win for the fourth time in five games as it continues a five-game road trip.

It was a rare road defeat for the Sharks, who had won eight of their previous 10 away games and are a win from matching their 2014-15 road win total of 21. It was also their third game in four nights, so two days off is probably much appreciated.

""We've been consistently good for a long time,"" said coach Peter DeBoer, whose team had allowed four goals on its preceding three-game winning streak. ""You're going to have those once in a while. It's how we respond to it. I think we just have to throw it away and get ready for the next one.""

The win in St. Louis at the beginning of the month featured a goal from Joe Thornton, who saw his seven-game point streak come to an end against the Hurricanes, but he has 11 on a six-game run against the Blues.

Martin Jones faced Carolina and St. Louis, posting a 1.58 GAA on a 4-1-0 span.","['streak', 'sharks', 'steen', 'louis', 'sharksblues', 'ice', 'st', 'games', 'goals', 'win', 'preview', 'road']"

A new study suggests that the way your brain works may vary from season to season. Researchers found that when people in the study did certain cognitive tasks, the ways the brain utilizes its resources to complete those tasks changed with the seasons.

Although peoples actual performance of the tasks did not change with the seasons, the brain activity for the ongoing process varied.

Participants were observed during each season of the year for a period of four and a half days in a lab. They had no access to the external world or seasonal cues such as daylight. Researchers scanned their brains while they performed tasks testing their ability to sustain attention and to store, update, and compare information in their memories.

They found that the peoples performance on these tasks did not change, regardless of the time of year. However results did show that the neurol cost of performing the tasks did change with the time of the year.

Apple announced Wednesday that the company will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the Obama administration break into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in last December's attack that killed 14 people.

I like the idea of boycott Apple until such time as they give that information, I think thats a great idea, Trump said, during a rally at Pawleys Island, S.C.

First of all, the phone is not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people  the phones owned by the government, he said, aiming a jab at the Apple CEO. Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is.

However, multiple media reports noted Friday that Trump's official Twitter account tweeted about his boycott call from an iPhone. In a subsequent tweet Trump said that he uses both iPhone and Samsung. ""If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info,"" he added.

Social media giants Facebook and Twitter have backed Apple in its dispute with the FBI, as has Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Experts have also lauded Apples move as a PR masterstroke.

Fernando Cardenal, one of the priests who famously rebuffed a papal order to quit Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, died in Managua on Saturday. He was 82 and long back in the good graces of the church.

The Jesuit was a practitioner of liberation theology and he who joined the Sandinista rebels after they toppled the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979, first leading a widely praised literacy campaign and then serving as education minister.

The participation of priests such as Cardenal, his brother Ernesto and Miguel d'Escoto in the leftist government irked Pope John Paul II, who publicly wagged his finger at Ernesto Cardenal during a papal visit to the country in 1983. A year later, they were among four suspended from the priesthood for refusing to leave their political posts. Ernesto Cardenal, perhaps Nicaragua's best-known poet, was culture minister and d'Escoto was foreign minister.

In an open ""Letter to my Friends"" published in late 1984, Fernando Cardenal defended his decision in theological terms, saying, ""I believe before God that I would be committing a grave sin"" by abandoning a post committed to the poor.

""I cannot conceive of a God that would ask me to abandon my commitment to the people,"" he said.

Fernando Cardenal left his Cabinet post in 1990 and, like his brother, eventually broke with the main Sandinista Front led by Daniel Ortega.

In a step even more unusual than his suspension, he was reinstated to the Jesuit order in 1997 and until his death was heading the Nicaragua office of Fe and Alegria, a Jesuit program that brings schools to poor parts of Nicaragua and other countries.

The agency confirmed the death in a statement, praising his ""tireless struggle to defend the rights of the most vulnerable.""

Local news media said the death resulted from complications following a surgery two weeks ago.

Pope John Paul II told Cardenal and other priests  including Cardenal's brother Ernesto  to quit politics. When they refused, he suspended them from the priesthood in 1984.

Cardenal left politics in 1990 and was reinstated as a Jesuit in 1997  an extremely unusual step.

He spent his last years leading a Jesuit organization running schools in poor parts of the country.

Aaron J. Eidem, 37, was struck by his own Toyota Avalon, after the parked car was hit by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 44 just west of Springfield, Mo., where Eidem resided. Eidem had pulled over to help a motorist move a disabled vehicle from the inside shoulder of the highway to the right shoulder, which was deemed a safer spot to change a tire, an officer at the scene told the Springfield News-Leader.

He was a good Samaritan, Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said. He stopped and was helping a vehicle with a flat tire.

After hitting Eidems car, the tractor-trailer hit another vehicle, which then collided with a second tractor-trailer. No other injuries were reported, however.

Officials told FoxNews.com on Monday morning that no charges were anticipated in connection with the crash.



A U.S. Army captain, Eidem was also an assistant professor of military science at Missouri State University.

He served his country for almost 20 years as a military police officer and instructor, Dean of the College of Health and Human Services Victor Matthews wrote in a statement. He deployed to combat three times, earning the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.

The latest check on consumer spending showed Americans did little of it in December. This follows fourth-quarter gross domestic product data which failed to break even one percent, registering just 0.7 percent.

Could the slate of presidential candidates do much better? The Tax Foundation took a detailed look at the impacts of tax plans of the candidates to determine just that.

When it comes to overall economic growth over the next 10 years, Senator Ted Cruz beats the bunch with his policies contributing to an additional 13.9 percent growth over and above what government projects for the economy during those years. In other words, in each of the next 10 years, his tax policies would add another 1.39 percent worth of growth each year. Donald Trumps tax plan would add an additional 11.5 percent growth over the decade or 1.15 percent growth each year. Senator Bernie Sanders is the worst performer because his tax plan would push down growth by 9.5 percent over the decade, while Hillary Clintons plan is pretty much a wash, pushing down growth by 1 percent over the 10 years.

Keep in mind that critics say plans like Trumps would fail to fund anything other than the big entitlement programs. Under Trump, defense programs, for example, would go begging. The Tax Foundation analysis shows Trumps plan reducing government revenues by nearly $12 trillion over ten years, the most of any candidate.

If its job growth youre interested in, Trumps is the biggest winner. His tax plan would grow jobs by 5.3 million over 10 years. The worst? Sanders, whose tax plan would cut jobs by 5.9 million.

Wage growth, another critical metric for Americans because weve had so little of it, is highest under the Cruz plan, growth rates in wages would jump 12.2 percent. And, workers would definitely feel the burn under Sanders, whose plans would cut wage growth rates by 4.3 percent. Trumps wage rate growth would be half of that of Cruz, at 6.5 percent. Clintons plan does little to move the needle in any direction when it comes to wage growth or job growth.

One big takeaway from the Tax Foundation analysis is this: It takes massive change to move the economy significantly with tax policy alone. The American economy is massive, still the biggest in the world, and encouraging it to expand is tough work for legislators.","['wage', 'sanders', 'little', 'trumps', 'plans', 'tax', 'juice', 'growth', 'candidates', 'plan', 'expand', 'presidential', 'economy']"

Those are completely irrational fears based on the public's aversion to snakes, said Tom French of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, who's directing the project at the 39-square mile Quabbin Reservoir and representing the state at a public meeting Tuesday to address the concerns.

French said he's received several emails and phone calls from worried residents who fear the snakes will escape the island.

Division of Fisheries and Wildlife via AP)

""People are afraid that we're going to put snakes in a place of public use and that they are going to breed like rabbits and spread over the countryside and kill everybody,"" he said.

There are only about 200 of the endangered snakes indigenous to Massachusetts left in five scattered pockets from greater Boston to the Berkshires, French said. Loss of habitat and human-caused deaths means they could disappear altogether, which is why the Quabbin project is so critical.

The plan to establish the snakes on Mount Zion  at more than 1,400 acres, the largest island in the reservoir  has been in the works for several years. A handful of snakes will be raised at Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, and placed on the island in a couple more years when they are mature enough to survive in the wild.

The project has received the endorsement of Gov. Charlie Baker.

The public's concerns stem from the fact that rattlesnakes can swim and the island is connected to the mainland by a pair of narrow causeways, French said.

Bob Curley, an avid hiker, isn't opposed to the rattlesnake preservation effort; he just doesn't think the Quabbin is the place to do it. Even though Mount Zion of off limits to the public, he's concerned the state will use the snakes as an excuse to shut off public access to areas around the reservoir about 65 miles west of Boston.

""When the inevitable happens and there is an interplay between a hiker and a rattler, what's the repercussion?"" said the Athol resident, who said his dog was bitten by a rattlesnake last summer. ""Are the trails around the Quabbin going to be shut down?""

There is no plan to deny public access to the Quabbin, and concerns that snakes will leave the island and threaten humans are unfounded, French said.

Rattlesnakes are timid and only strike out when provoked. There have been no documented rattlesnake bite deaths in Massachusetts since colonial times, he said. He can't even recall an accidental bite in his 32 years with the state agency even though Massachusetts' rattlesnake populations live largely in public lands that get heavy foot traffic.

On Mount Zion, the snakes will be safe from human interference, have ideal places to hibernate and plenty of mice and chipmunks to eat.

""We want one place where the impact of people in not part of the equation,"" French said.

The state's message appears to be getting out.

Nancy Allen, chairwoman of the selectboard in Petersham, a town on the eastern shore of the reservoir, said she heard from fearful residents when the plan became public, but those fears died down once people educated themselves about the project.

""Once they started to look into the facts, people started to change their minds,"" she said.

Peter Mallett, a recreational fisherman who lives in New Salem, a town on the Quabbin's western shore, opposed the snake project at first, but changed his mind after digging deeper.

""People are just petrified of snakes,"" he said.","['plans', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'reservoir', 'colony', 'rattlesnake', 'french', 'state', 'massachusetts', 'quabbin', 'plan', 'public', 'snakes']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"'You're not the shooter, are you?' Witnesses describe rides with accused Michigan gunman",[],"Multiple witnesses have come forward to describe harrowing car trips Saturday night with Jason Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people and critically injuring two others during a six-hour shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Mich.

The witnesses' testimony indicates that Dalton was picking up fares in between carrying out the apparently random shootings. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Sunday that Dalton was a driver for the ride-sharing service, but did not say whether he was working Saturday night.

Matt Mellen told WWMT that he called police to report Dalton for erratic driving more than an hour before the accused shooter began firing on his targets.

Mellen said Dalton picked him up around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday and began driving very erratically after he got a phone call and hung up. He said Dalton was speeding, sideswiping cars and driving over medians and lawns. Mellen said when the vehicle came to a stop, he ran from the car and called police and also reported Dalton to Uber.

Authorities allege that Dalton shot the first victim outside of an apartment complex a little more than an hour later.

MLive reported that a Facebook post from a woman named Mackenzie Waite described an Uber driver named Jason as ""not a safe ride"". Waite, who said in the post that her fiance had booked a ride with Dalton, claimed that Dalton sideswiped a car while running a stop sign and then drove 80 miles per hour down a local street ""swerving in and out of oncoming traffic"".

Waite's post was timestampted at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, about 30 minutes before the first shooting took place. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting confirmed to MLive that law enforcement knew about the post.

Fox17 reported that a local couple, Jamie and Kacey Black saw a man jump out of a vehicle they recognized later as Dalton's. The man told them the driver had been driving erratically and would not let him out. It was not immediately clear whether the man was Waite's fiance or Mellen.

Kacey Black said she called 911 to report the driver, but said ""I felt like they didn't believe me. They just kind of laughed at me.""

At 6 p.m., a woman was shot multiple times outside an apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County. She was expected to survive.

At around 7 p.m., Dalton's next door neighbor James Block told the Associated Press that his niece saw Dalton drive out his driveway. When he got to the street, he stopped and rapidly backed toward his garage, turning his vehicle so the lights shined toward Block's house, Block said. Then he drove off.

""He was there between the shootings,"" Block said.

A Kalamazoo man with the Twitter handle IamKeithBlack posted Sunday that Dalton had given him a ride at around 8 p.m. A receipt he posted indicated that Dalton had driven him 4.8 miles and the ride had lasted 10 minutes.

About four hours after the initial shooting and 15 miles away, a man and his son were shot to death while looking at vehicles at Seelye Kia of Kalamazoo.

Then, 15 minutes later, gunfire erupted outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Four women, including retired school teacher Mary Jo Nye, were slain. A 14-year-old girl was wounded.

At around midnight, an Indiana man visiting Kalamazoo with his wife and in-laws decided to call for an Uber ride after hearing about the shooting spree. They were told their driver's name would be Jason, and he would be driving a Chevrolet HHR.

The couple, who told Fox17 they did not wish to be identified, said the driver seemed to be aware of the news about an active shooter.

""I halfheartedly joked at him and said 'You are not the shooter are you?',"" the man said, ""and he said 'no, and I said are you sure, and he said no, Im just really tired.'""

Dalton told his passengers that he had been driving for seven hours that day. The couple said they did not smell gunpowder or notice a weapon inside the car. WOOD-TV reported that the foursome were dropped off at a Radisson hotel at around 20 minutes after midnight.

About 20 minutes later, he was arrested without incident after a deputy spotted his vehicle driving through downtown Kalamazoo after leaving a bar parking lot. A semi-automatic handgun was found in the car.

2:15 p.m.

The British head of the European Union's police cooperation agency has warned that the United Kingdom could find it harder to protect its citizens against terrorism and organized crime if it leaves the EU.

Europol Director Rob Wainwright said Monday that if London turns its back on the EU and the police cooperation capabilities it offers, ""it would make the U.K.'s job harder, I think, to protect the citizens from terrorism and organized crime.""

Speaking at the launch of a new center to fight migrant smuggling, Wainwright said that the British have helped mold cooperation among police forces in the 28-nation bloc, ""because it's the unanimous opinion of the British police services that they need that level of engagement.""

12:40 p.m.

The European Union's executive Commission says it will stay out of the referendum campaign on whether Britain should leave the EU.

Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker did campaign last July in a Greek referendum on whether to accept an EU-brokered agreement to secure a massive economic bailout. But chief Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said Monday that ""we will not take part in this process"" ahead of the June 23 poll in Britain.

Schinas did not rule out the possibility that EU commissioner Jonathon Hill, who is from Britain, might campaign in a personal capacity.

Commission officials are appointed, not elected, and often embody the stereotype of the ""faceless Eurocrat"" that some Britons blame for their country's struggles with the EU.

09:40 a.m.

British Prime Minister David Cameron is preparing to formally present his plan for a June 23 referendum on Britain's European Union membership to Parliament.

Cameron, who wants Britain to remain part of the 28-nation bloc, will go to Parliament Monday after a weekend that saw London Mayor Boris Johnson announce he is in favor of leaving the union.

The British pound sterling fell in early currency trading Monday on concern that the vote could be closer than expected.

Johnson wrote in The Daily Telegraph that the referendum offers a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" chance for real change. He says remaining in the bloc would mean more federalism and less democracy.

Johnson is joined by other Conservative Party figures although Cameron enjoys the support of key Cabinet ministers.","['cooperation', 'campaign', 'unions', 'union', 'referendum', 'british', 'europol', 'wainwright', 'chief', 'exit', 'european', 'uk', 'eu', 'bloc', 'latest', 'britain', 'risky']"

New York City as everyone knows was hit by the worst terrorist attack in history on September 11, 2001 and counter-terrorism experts say its still a potential target.

Thats why theres always a heightened state of vigilance here. But now, the Obama administration wants to cut anti-terrorism funding to the Big Apple:

(Blasio) We cant reduce funding to stop terror at a point when the terror threat is greater than ever. It makes no sense.

Thats Mayor Bill de Blasio, joined by Democratic New York Senator Charles Schumer, who made an unusual rebuff of the Obama administration.

The White House counters that it is still providing what it calls robust funding to New York City.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Common software would have allowed FBI to unlock San Bernardino shooter's phone,[],"The county government that owned the iPhone in a high-profile legal battle between Apple Inc. and the Justice Department paid for but never installed a feature that would have allowed the FBI to easily and immediately unlock the phone as part of the terrorism investigation into the shootings that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.



If the technology, known as mobile device management, had been installed, San Bernardino officials would have been able to remotely unlock the iPhone for the FBI without the theatrics of a court battle that is now pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns.



The service costs $4 per month per phone.



Instead, the only person who knew the unlocking passcode for the phone is the dead gunman, Syed Farook, who worked as an inspector in the county's public health department.



The iPhone assigned to Farook also lacked a Touch ID feature, meaning the FBI cannot use the dead gunman's thumbprint to unlock it now. The FBI found the phone in a car after the shootings.



A U.S. magistrate last week ordered Apple to provide the FBI with highly specialized software that could be loaded onto the work-issued iPhone 5C used by Farook. He died with his wife in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in December.



The software would help the FBI hack into the phone by bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.



The FBI said it wants to determine whether Farook had used his phone to communicate with others about the attack.



FBI Director James Comey said the agency owes it to the victims of the San Bernardino terror attacks to try to gain access to a cellphone used by one of the gunmen.



In a message posted Sunday night on the Lawfare blog, Comey said the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead."" Comey said the court case ""isn't about trying to set a precedent"" but is instead about doing justice for the victims.



Apple has said it will protest the ruling and has until Friday to intervene in court.



San Bernardino had an existing contract with a technology provider, MobileIron Inc., but did not install it on any inspectors' iPhones, county spokesman David Wert said. There is no countywide policy on the matter and departments make their own decisions, he said.



MobileIron has confirmed that if the software were installed on the iPhone, it would unlock it.



Wert disputed the value of the remote management technology because he said Farook -- or any other county employee -- could have removed it manually. That would have alerted county technology employees and led them to intervene.



In many offices and classrooms, officially issued smartphones include the installed management software. It can unlock the phone, delete all information in case of loss or theft, track the device's physical location, determine which apps are installed, check battery life and push software updates. The technology is intended to make such products more suitable in corporate environments, where tighter controls are important to protect company secrets.



""This is the business case"" for mobile device management, said John Dickson, a principal at Denim Group Ltd., a security consultancy. ""The organization simply has no control or influence or anything over the device unless they have some MDM authority. The ability to do remote air updates, the ability to do remote wipe, the ability to control certain settings. Those are the standard kinds of things you do in mobile device management.""



Dickson said ""the big question now going forward, it builds the case for, is why this guy would have an essentially uncontrolled device.""



This is the first time since the county issued its first Blackberry device in 2003 that law enforcement has needed access to a locked county-owned phone, Wert said. Prosecutors said in court filings that the county gave its consent to search the device. County policy said digital devices can be searched at any time and Farook signed such an agreement.

Apple executives said Friday that the company had worked hard to help federal investigators get information off the locked iPhone, suggesting they use an iCloud workaround while the phone was connected to a familiar wireless network so that it would begin automatically backing up and provide access to data. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing legal process.



The executives said Apple sent engineers to work with the FBI on the workaround but the effort ultimately failed. The FBI said it worked with the county to reset the iCloud password a few days after the attack to try to get immediate access to the data. That effort eliminated the possibility of the Apple suggested workaround being possible.



But if the county had installed the management device it had bought onto Farook's phone, none of these efforts would have been necessary.



Ted Olson, a lawyer for Apple, told ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday that the legal fight had evoked an important debate about privacy and civil liberties. But he warned there'd be no limiting what the government could require Apple to do in the future if the Justice Department got its way this time.



""Apple has a responsibility to maintain the trust and faith of millions of people who've depended upon Apple to produce a product that protects their privacy -- their intimate, personal life,"" said Olson, a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ""This is a Pandora's box.""



Gartner Inc., a technology research firm, estimated that over 60 percent of large enterprises -- meaning business, government and educational entities -- used some kind of MDM software as of last year, though not necessarily on all company-owned devices. That percentage is likely higher now than when the research was done months ago, said Terrence Cosgrove, a research director with Gartner's mobile and client computing research group. Cosgrove said MDM adoption rates are generally higher among government users.



Many workers balk at the idea that the software can monitor and track their personal phones, said Alex Heid, chief research officer at the cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard Inc. But if the company provides a phone, it's considered reasonable practice to use such software.



""If a company's assumption is that they might not be able to get back into a device one day then it's not really a company asset at that point, it's a gift,"" he said.","['farook', 'apple', 'san', 'bernardino', 'installed', 'county', 'phone', 'unlock', 'iphone', 'common', 'allowed', 'device', 'fbi', 'software', 'technology', 'shooters']"

The 24-year-old, who already holds two math degrees, will begin his math PhD at MIT this offseason, specializing in spectral graph theory, numerical linear algebra, and machine learning, the Baltimore Sun reports.

Urschel was already well-known for his academic achievements, having taught trigonometry and analytic geometry as part of his master's degree while playing at Penn State, reports Onward State.

His published research includes ""A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians."" ""There's nothing I love more than crunching numbers, except maybe crunching defensive linemen on the football field,"" Urschel, who did advanced math problems to test how well he was recovering from a concussion last year, writes in his math-meets-football column at the Players' Tribune.

Urschel's playing career is progressing as well as his academic one and he could become a full-time starter for the Ravens in 2016, notes Jamison Hensley at ESPN, predicting that the day will come when NFL announcers introduce him as ""Dr. John Urschel."" (Last year, Urschel said he was in football for the love of the game, not the money.)

Toyota notched its first Daytona 500 victory Sunday, winning ''The Great American Race'' three months after its first NASCAR Sprint Cup championship.

''This is very difficult for me to put in words. I cannot articulate adequately what this means to Toyota,'' said David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development. ''It's our single biggest race in our company's history. I'll put it in front of the Indy 500, which was a pretty special one back in 2003.''

Gil de Ferran delivered Toyota the Indy 500 victory. Denny Hamlin provided the Daytona 500 win.

''For me, the most enjoyable thing out of winning is seeing people that invest with you, all the time and the resources that they put with us,'' said Joe Gibbs, Hamlin's team owner. ''Then to see them win and be that happy, get a chance to celebrate, it's really a thrill for me.''

When Toyota made its Cup debut in 2007, many thought the Japanese automaker would find quick success because of its deep pockets. But the road to victory lane was far from smooth.

Michael Waltrip Racing, Toyota's flagship team, was busted for cheating during the 2007 Daytona 500. High-profile Red Bull Racing struggled to make races and ultimately left NASCAR after four full seasons. And Toyota's third team, Bill Davis Racing, was mostly an also-ran.

''It's heart-wrenching that none of the freshmen class are still with us,'' Wilson said. ''That's not the end of the story that any of us wanted to see. But again, it goes to how difficult, how competitive the sport is.

Toyota's fortunes changed dramatically when Joe Gibbs Racing switched from Chevrolet in 2008.

''They took a chance on Toyota,'' Wilson said. ''Look at where they were. Three-time champions. They took a chance on us. The pressure that put on our shoulders to deliver was enormous. I hated that it's taken us this long.''

Toyota dominated Speedweeks. Hamlin won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, eight days after winning the exhibition Sprint Unlimited. And Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch, the reigning Cup champion, won one of the two qualifying races.

Toyota also claimed four of the top five spots in the 500, with Martin Truex Jr. finishing second, Busch third and Carl Edwards fifth.

It was the kind of finish many, including Wilson, thought would happen years earlier.

''We knew it was going to be a long, tough slog,'' Wilson said. ''I'll admit that I thought within the first five years we might have a shot at a championship. I think the first time I cried in this sport was 2010 when Denny came to Homestead with a 15-point lead and we lost. Had he won, we would have made that five-year target.

''Like in life, when you go through trials, you have the emotion and the heartache, and when you do achieve a level of success, it truly is sweeter. Perspective truly is a wonderful thing to have.''","['wilson', 'daytona', 'title', 'follows', 'cup', 'toyota', 'winning', 'thought', 'won', 'victory', '1st', 'team', 'racing', '500']"

Multiple witnesses have come forward to describe harrowing car trips Saturday night with Jason Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people and critically injuring two others during a six-hour shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Mich.

The witnesses' testimony indicates that Dalton was picking up fares in between carrying out the apparently random shootings. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Sunday that Dalton was a driver for the ride-sharing service, but did not say whether he was working Saturday night.

MLive reported that a Facebook post from a woman named Mackenzie Waite described an Uber driver named Jason as ""not a safe ride"". Waite, who said in the post that her fiance had booked a ride with Dalton, claimed that Dalton sideswiped a car while running a stop sign and then drove 80 miles per hour down a local street ""swerving in and out of oncoming traffic"".

Waite's post was timestampted at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, about 30 minutes before the first shooting took place.

foxnews,2016-02-16 00:00:00,Ancient Roman brooch contains 'lovely' palindrome,[],"A person with a metal detector has discovered a 1,800-year-old copper brooch, engraved with the letters ""RMA,"" on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It contains wordplay that is, quite literally, ""lovely,"" scientists have found.

The letters on the brooch, which dates to a time when the Roman Empire controlled Britain, contain different meanings depending on how they are read. When read left to right, the letters form a monogram for ""Roma,"" the name of Rome and its deity. ""Roma may be identified as Dea Roma, the deity personifying the city of Rome,"" researchers wrote in a paper set to be published in the journal Lucerna.

However, when read from right to left, the same letters form the monogram for ""Amor,"" the Latin name for Cupid, the god of love. ""The palindrome Roma-Amor was widely recognised and played on in antiquity,"" the researchers noted, referring to the fact that the word can be read backward or forward to spell the same phrase. [6 Most Tragic Love Stories in History]

There's yet another possible meaning. If the person who wore this brooch also wore a second brooch containing the monogram for Mars, the god of war, the full meaning of the two brooches combined could be ""Rome, (city) of Mars"" or ""Rome, beloved of Mars,"" the researchers wrote.

The different meanings could serve to ""perplex the viewer and thus deflect the risk of ill-fortune directed by a malign gaze,"" the researchers wrote.

The brooch was found by a person using a metal detector in December 2015. The discovery was reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), which keeps records of such finds.

Worn by a Roman soldier?

In ancient times, ""the brooch was probably attached to a tunic or cloak,"" using a pin, said Sally Worrell, one of the paper's authors and a national finds adviser with PAS.

The wearer of the brooch may have been a Roman soldier or veteran, the researchers said in the paper, noting that similar brooches have been found in Roman military garrisons in southern Germany and eastern Europe.

Although no Roman garrison has been identified so far on the Isle of Wight, researchers say it's possible that Roman soldiers traveled to the island, while Roman veterans could have settled on it.

Metal find

In England and Wales, it's legal for amateurs to use metal detectors to find artifacts, as long as they have permission from the landowner and they avoid archaeological sites that have been granted protection by the government. Certain finds (such as those made of precious metal) must be reported to antiquities authorities.

While the use of metal detectors by amateurs is legal, it is a controversial practice; some professional archaeologists say it can damage archaeological sites.

It's not known if the finder of the brooch will donate it to a museum.

We've been able to determine that they were able to put a satellite or some space device into orbit, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said.

He said the Pentagon will, in light of this, begin formal consultations with South Korea over improvements to their own missile defense systems.

We'd like to see this move as quickly as possible, but we're beginning the consultations now in the coming days with the South Koreans and we expect that this will move in an expeditious fashion, Cook said.

The U.S. and other world powers have condemned the launch of a long-range rocket, describing it as a banned test of ballistic missile technology.

At an emergency meeting Sunday of the U.N. Security Council which includes the U.S., all 15 council members approved a statement condemning the launch and pledging to ""expeditiously"" adopt a new resolution with ""significant"" new sanctions.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said a new U.N. resolution targeting North Korea over its rocket launch and recent nuclear test must be adopted very quickly and include ""unprecedented measures"" that its leader, Kim Jong Un, doesn't expect.

The United States and China have been trying to agree on a new sanctions resolution since North Korea conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,"Why 10,000-plus sharks are hanging out in Florida waters",[],"Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 blacktip sharks are currently swimming off the Florida coast, but while these numbers may seem menacing, shark researchers say it's not unusual to see these animals  visible as tiny dark spots in aerial photos and video  in the area at this time of year.

These annual visitors are there to feed on fish and bask in warm coastal waters, according to Stephen Kajiura, a professor of biological sciences at Florida Atlantic University who conducts a survey of the migrating sharks every winter. And don't panic  these sharks typically have little interest in people, Kajiura told Live Science.

Visitors to those beaches could even catch a glimpse of the blacktips breaching, leaping out of the water ""like dolphins,"" Kajiura said.

Kajiura began surveying the blacktip sharks in 2011, counting them after they migrate to south Florida during the winter. He said these numbers are typical during the peak of the blacktips' winter sojurn in the area, which begins in mid-January and lasts until the end of March.

The sharks, which grow to about 6.5 feet (2 meters) in length, spend their summer months near Georgia and the Carolinas, where they mate and birth their pups, Kajiura said.

During their Florida stay, these colonies of blacktip sharks, so-named for the distinctive black markings on the tips of their dorsal fins and tails, gather in coastal waters stretching from Miami to Jupiter Inlet, covering a distance of about 80 miles (129 kilometers).

And the 10,000 to 12,000 estimate represents only the sharks that are visible in the narrow band of water about 660 feet (200 meters) from the shore, Kajiura said, and is ""a gross underestimate"" of how many sharks there are in total.

To conduct the surveys, Kajiura mounts a high-definition video camera and a digital still camera to point out the window of a small plane as it flies adjacent to the beach. He later downloads the stills and footage to count all the visible sharks in the water.

""We see lots more sharks on the other side of the plane, so there's a lot more out there that we're simply not counting in the survey,"" Kajiura told Live Science. ""We simply don't know how big this school is, how far it extends off into deeper water,"" he said.

But people have little to fear from these seasonal visitors, Kajiura added. They feed on small, shiny fish, so swimmers should avoid wearing reflective watches or jewelry that might be mistaken for the sharks' prey. And when the water is murky or when it's dark out, a shark may be more likely to confuse light signals from human movement with prey activity.

Otherwise, ""they're not curious types,"" Kajiura said, and as long as people exercise common sense and don't harass the sharks, the blacktips will likely just avoid them completely.

And lucky beachgoers might even catch a glimpse of the colony without ever entering the water.

""You can literally sit on the beach and you can watch the blacktips jumping and spinning and splashing back into the water,"" Kajiura said. ""They're not out to get you, you're not part of their diet, so you may as well go to the beach and enjoy the phenomenon.""

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,"Gas prices jump more than sixtyfold in Venezuela, president devaluates currency",[],"A driver sits in his car as he fuels up at a gas station in Caracas, Venezuela, Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2016.

In an attempt to shield Venezuela's economy from further collapse and fend off mounting calls for his ouster, President Nicolas Maduro addressed the nation Wednesday night to announce a monumental gasoline price hike.

In this South American country, where gasoline has long been so heavily subsidized that it is virtually free, gasoline prices are a touchy issue in Venezuela  memories are still vivid from 1989 riots in Caracas that erupted after the proposal of a series of austerity measures including a hike in gas prices.

Maduro said gas prices will jump more than sixtyfold, yet drivers will still be able to fill their tanks for pennies.

He said the increased gasoline revenue will finance the government's social programs.

""We must charge for gas,"" he said. ""I ask that the people welcome and support this new system.""

The price of premium gasoline will rise from 0.1 bolivar a liter to 6 bolivars per liter, and regular gasoline will jump from 0.07 bolivar to 1 bolivar per liter. In contrast, a beer costs around 300 bolivars while a basket of strawberries goes for 800 bolivars. Calculated at the widely used black market currency exchange rate, the price per gallon will be a few U.S. cents.

Maduro also announced that the strongest of the country's official exchange rates, used for essential goods like food and medicine, would be changing from 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar to 10 bolivars to the dollar. Meanwhile, the bolivar is worth about 1,000 to the dollar on the black market.

The economic measures come as Maduro fights for his political survival.

Oil accounts 95 percent of Venezuela's export earnings, and plummeting world prices have helped push its state-led economy into a deep recession, with chronic shortages, empty store shelves and soaring inflation.

Opposition leaders took control of Congress in January for the first time in more than a decade and have been on a collision course with the socialist president ever since.

Lawmakers are weighing several options for removing Maduro from office, including shortening his term, and calling a constitutional referendum. But many fear the Supreme Court, which has not ruled against the executive branch since the late President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999, would simply overturn these efforts.

Opposition leaders quickly dismissed Wednesday's measures as insufficient to right the flagging economy.

Earlier in the day, the opposition's top vote-getter, two-time opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, called for a presidential recall referendum.

Maduro's approval ratings have languished in the 20 percent range for most of his term, but a recall battle would be complicated. To force a recall referendum, the opposition would need to gather nearly 4 million signatures. And if a referendum was held, the president would be removed only if the number of anti-Maduro votes exceeded the number of votes he got in the 2013 election.

A voter referendum might be a longer and more risky path than some of the other recall options, but Capriles said it was one the government would be forced to recognize.

""Now is the time,"" he said. ""They will not be able to overturn a referendum.""

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,English only fight erupts at a Las Vegas caucus site when Dolores Huerta offers to translate,[],"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - DECEMBER 12: Labor leader Dolores Huerta attends the 2015 Annual Spirit Of Liberty Awards Dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel on December 12, 2015 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images)2015 Michael Kovac

Veteran civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, an avid supporter of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is accusing Bernie Sanders campaign staffers of preventing her from providing Spanish-language translation to voters who needed it at a Las Vegas caucus location during Saturdays Democratic primary.

Huerta, who co-founded the National Farmworkers Association with late Cesar Chavez in the 1960s, told Univision reporter Fernando Peinado: I dont feel that Sanders people respect our community. They stopped the people from having translation [services] in something as important as these caucuses that are taking place. They are showing that they dont respect us.

According to several reports, Huerta offered to help serve as an interpreter at the Harrahs Las Vegas Hotel and Casino caucus site because many caucus-goers were workers who spoke only Spanish.

However, when she got on stage, where the voting was taking place, many in the crowd started yelling No, no, no! She told Huffington Post that they were Sanders supporters and were also shouting English only.

That is completely against the spirit of everything that were working for, Huerta said. ""To deprive these voters at this crucial time of having a translation of what was going on  this is something they need in order to know what's taking place.""

She told ThinkProgress that a Sanders supporter went up on stage as well and she suggested we both translate. However, the moderator decided no translation would be used.

A video of the event - starting around the 54-min mark - shows the moderator asking if anyone speaks Spanish. When Huerta gets on stage, its difficult to make out the crowd is yelling -- yet No, No! is clearly heard.

The moderator asks the audience to stop shouting and says that other Spanish speakers in the crowd can point out if Huerta says anything that pro-Clinton. Eventually he decided were going forward in English only.

The room was divided with the Hillary people on one side and the Bernie people on the other, Huerta told ThinkProgress. It was really unfortunate, because there were many Spanish-speaking voters, the casino workers. We wanted to make it more comfortable for them, so they could know what was going on.

The 85-year-old clarified the exchange on Twitter.

I offered to translate & Bernie supporters chanted English only! We fought too long & hard to be silenced Si Se Puede! she tweeted.

The exchange went viral on Saturday night after actress America Ferrera, a vocal supporter of Clinton, also took to Twitter to speak out about the incident.

Harrah's casino site- Bernie supporters chant ""English-only"" to stop civil rights leader @DoloresHuerta from providing Spanish translation, she wrote.

Symone Sanders, the campaign secretary for the Sanders campaign, told CNN that the senators campaign was about bringing people together.

""As the senator has said, this campaign is about bringing people together not dividing them,"" she said. ""We expect our supporters to be respectful of all people and don't condone anything otherwise.""

Actress Susan Sarandon, who is a Sanders support, disputed the accounts that a Sanders supporter yelled the English only remark.

@AmericaFerrera I was there. Nobody frm Bernie's side said English only. Moderator did when no neutral translator was found@DoloresHuerta, she wrote.

.@AmericaFerrera I was there. Nobody frm Bernie's side said English only. Moderator did when no neutral translator was found@DoloresHuerta  Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) February 21, 2016

This is not the first time Huerta has spoken out against Sanders. In an interview with Fox News Latino this week, Huerta said she was supporting Clinton because Sanders has not been progressive enough when it comes to immigration.

Bernie Sanders really hurt us on immigration reform, Huerta told FNL. In 2007 we had a great opportunity to get immigration reform passed. Sen. John McCain was at the table, Sen. Ted Kennedy was pushing that immigration reform bill and we could have gotten that bill out of the Senate and into the House and passed immigration reform.

Bernie Sanders came out against it, she said. He didnt call me. He didnt call all of us who have been working on immigration reform for the last 40 years. I dont know who he listened to, but that showed me he wasnt really paying attention.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The media's firewall against Donald Trump: The voters must be dummies or racists,['Howard Kurtz'],"Just when it seemed the media were starting to accept Donald Trumps front-runner status after South Carolina, we had a newspaper throwing a temper tantrum.

New Yorks Daily News, ticked off at the outcome, blamed the voters with this front-page screamer: CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.

In other words, TABLOID TO VOTERS: YOURE ALL LOSERS.

And the lead of the story was just as insulting: The piggish voters of South Carolina gobbled up the slop that Donald Trump served up Saturday  handing the bloodthirsty billionaire his second straight Republican presidential primary win.

I know the News, which is becoming a sad parody, despises Trump, having depicted him as a clown and, during his dustup with the Pope, the ANTICHRIST.

But that doesnt seem much different than the Huffington Post reacting to Donald Trumps first primary victory with a red-letter headline: NH GOES RACIST SEXIST XENOPHOBIC.

And it illustrates how, when it comes to Trump, some in the media are moving from denial to anger.

I wonder if a New York Times piece on the eve of the South Carolina primary is a more polite and sophisticated way of getting at the same pointthat the voters are to blame for making a lousy decision.

The Times has on-the-record quotes to back up its story line, but the underlying assumption is that Trump is just bad news:

Republicans in South Carolina have in recent years raced ahead of the national party in presenting an inclusive face to voters.

But in the face of this admirable progress comes a likely Trump victory: For party leaders and mainstream voters here, it may come as a kind of deflating climax...

His results in the two early-voting states so far have alarmed more traditional Republicans, who fear that a Trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of Republicans as an angry and intolerant party...

The fear among Republican leaders here is that a smashing victory for Mr. Trump would say more about the party, and about the state, potentially undermining South Carolinas image as a more welcoming place that is no longer defined by figures like Strom Thurmond.

Got it? The Palmetto State is now a welcoming place, but for Trump to win the primary would make South Carolina look like it was back in Thurmonds segregationist era.

As Trump has continued to gain strength, hes attracting a different kind of bad press, which tries to blame othersthe culture, the media, the Republican Partyfor what these critics see as the awful phenomenon that is The Donald.

Slate, in the process of slamming MSNBCs town hall with Trump, complains that the medias coverage of Trump has been soft, insufficient, and without substance because it has failed to deal with months of bigoted comments and almost pathological dishonesty.

Its that the medias relationship with Trump should worry Hillary Clinton, assuming each of them vanquishes their primary opponents. I would have said six months ago, perhaps naively, that a blatantly bigoted candidate would face such a sustained media firestorm (especially in liberal precincts) that he would be incapable of getting elected. Thats not yet the case. Indeed, there are no signs that the medias sick, interminable honeymoon with Trump will come to an end anytime soon.

Think about that. Trump is a bigoted and pathological liar, so any coverage that doesnt portray him that way, or confront him with his many sins, is embarrassingly anemic.

National Review Editor Rich Lowry, a fierce Trump critic, says in Politico that Trump is defining decorum down:

Weve grown used to how Trump has treated Jeb Bush in the debates, but that doesnt make it any less appalling a breach of political norms or basic decency.

The faces he makes while Bush talks, the constant interrupting, the petty put-downs  all of this would have been thought unworthy of the lowest political guttersnipe but have become an accepted part of the landscape thanks to Donald J. Trump...

The key to Trumps strength, which buttresses all his outrageousness, is that his supporters want someone to blow up the system. So there's almost nothing he can say or do that will discredit him in their eyes, and the least destructive scenario for his defeat  Trump blows himself up  will take some doing on his part.

Its all very entertaining  but so are demolition derbies.

Now theres an eye-catching metaphor.

National Reviews David French says both Trump and Bernie Sanders have risen from the wreckage of a broken culture:

The conservative culture we do have is still a celebrity culture, and Donald Trump has taken it by storm.

The secret of his continued dominance is that he does anger bigger and better than anyone else, and his fans are willing to forgive or even cheer any transgression against conservative principle or simple good taste as a result. All manner of cruelty and lies can be justified by fury at the Left, by rage at the GOPe, or by the cry of the other side does it.

Conservative leaders who were used to being the angriest and least politically correct people in the room now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of saying no  of saying that some things shouldnt be said and some ideas are genuinely offensive.

Back to the left, Salon paints Trump as a Frankenstein created by a pathetic GOP:

What makes Trump unique isnt his shameless sophistry or his crass rhetoric; he simply does what most politicians  especially on the right  have always done, only better and without limits. He knows his supporters  a majority of whom are old and white  dont care about policies (many of them have been voting against their own interests for years anyway), and so he goes straight to their sense of identity. Of course he cant make Mexico pay for a wall, but promising to do so assuages their fears of a country in which white people will, eventually, be a minority. If they cared about their jobs, that rage would be directed at the corporations that shipped them overseas, not the brown people coming here to park cars and pick fruit...

The GOP now consists mostly of old and angry white people who are rejecting a world they dont like or understand. The nativism and hysteria animating Trumps campaign has been at the center of Republican politics for a long time  Trump is simply capitalizing on it.

Old angry white guys, blatant bigotry, confederacy of dunces. Not much attempt here to discern why Trump has won the first two primary statesand giving him more ammunition that the press treats him unfairly.

Cara McCollum died at Cooper University Hospital, according to Frank DiMauro, chief operating officer of the TV station where she worked, and a Facebook message posted by her family.

Her family said in the Facebook post that the 24-year-old from Margate died with her family by her side in an operating room, and that her organs were donated.

""We've prayed constantly for a miracle, and we believe God has answered our prayers. Although it's not the miracle that we first envisioned, it's a miracle nonetheless,"" the family said. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years. ... We all will miss her now that she's gone.""

Her family posted a video of McCollum performing a version of ""Cups"" by Anna Kendrick in the film ""Pitch Perfect.""

The song includes the lyrics ""you're gonna miss me when I'm gone"" and was performed by Miss New York Kira Kazantsev when she won the Miss America pageant in September 2014. McCollum competed in the previous year's pageant after winning the 2013 Miss New Jersey title.

The Arkansas native graduated from Princeton University and was an anchor on SNJ Today, a news show serving the southern Jersey area.

She was dating Keith Jones, a TV anchor for Philadelphia's NBC affiliate.

""Please accept our sincerest thanks for your heartfelt prayers,"" Jones wrote on Facebook. ""Words fall short of describing the pain, but I'm eternally grateful and blessed for the time I spent with Cara. Her enormous heart enriched my life and changed me forever.""

McCollum was alone in her vehicle and was not wearing a seatbelt when her Mustang veered off Route 55 in Pittsgrove Township and struck a tree, then spun again and hit two more trees before ending up in an embankment, police said.

State police say McCollum appeared to have been driving too fast for conditions on the wet road. They do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.

Fox News entrance polls show Sanders won the Hispanic vote at 54 percent to Clinton's 45 percent, even though she had heavily been trying to woo Hispanics in the state since last year. In 2008, Clinton won Nevada's caucus thanks in part to strong Latino support. Clinton won 64% of the Hispanic vote - more than double - Barack Obama's 26%.

The state was the first substantial test of candidates' support with Hispanic voters in this election.

Nearly 1 in 5 voters in Nevada is Hispanic, according to the Pew Research Center, and Latino voters were a prime target for both campaigns.

The Hillary Clinton campaign has been on the ground in Nevada since April, and part of their strategy hasd been reaching out to Latina women  mothers and wives. The Bernie Sanders campaign got started late in Nevada but they rode momentum and enthusiasm from young Latinos, particularly young undocumented immigrants or DREAMers.

Though, they cant vote. DREAMers have been volunteering for the campaign and encouraging young voters to caucus.

Clinton captured the backing of voters who said electability and experience were important in their vote. But in a continuing sign of her vulnerability, Sanders did best with voters looking for a candidate who is caring and honest.

The contest in Nevada was the first of two presidential primary contests being held Saturday. Republicans were battling in South Carolina, a state seen as billionaire Donald Trump's to lose and one that could start to clarify who, if any, of the more mainstream candidates might emerge to challenge him.

For both parties, the 2016 election has laid bare voters' frustration with Washington and the influence of big money in the political system. The public mood has upended the usual political order, giving Sanders and Trump openings while leaving more traditional candidates scrambling to find their footing.

Clinton's victory in Nevada could be crucial in holding off a challenge from Sanders that has been tougher than almost anyone expected. Clinton and Sanders split the first two voting contests, revealing the Vermont senator's appeal with young people drawn to his impassioned calls for breaking up Wall Street banks and providing free tuition at public colleges and universities.

Clinton thanked her supporters via Twitter on Saturday afternoon.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win,"" Clinton said on Twitter.

Republicans were voting in South Carolina, the first Southern state in the 2016 presidential election. Trump spent the week threatening one rival with a lawsuit, accusing former President George W. Bush of lying, and even tangling with Pope Francis on immigration, yet he still entered the primary contest in strong position.

The prospect of a Trump win alarmed rival Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor trying mightily for a strong showing in the first Southern state to vote.

""Trump can't win, plain and simple,"" Bush told reporters outside a polling place in Greenville. ""A ton of people would be very uncomfortable with his divisive language and with his inexperience in so many ways.""

Some similar monitors include Beddit ($149), which also tracks your heart rate and breathing, and SleepRate ($100), which has an app full of useful information plus a wearable heart rate sensor. Withings Aura ($189.95) not only monitors your sleep, but it cycles through light and sound programs to try to improve it. Learn about other sleep trackers, including smartphone apps and smart mattresses.

These products mostly stand alone, but an upcoming sensor from Samsung called SleepSense will link up with Samsung's SmartThings Hub. When SleepSense detects that you're asleep, it will turn off the lights and TV and crank up the air conditioning. When you wake up, it'll turn on the coffee maker.

Note: Some fitness trackers that you wear around your wrist or clip onto your clothes monitor how well you sleep. Before you buy one, check out the exclusive Komando Fitness Tracker Comparison Chart.

2. A bright idea

How many times have you come home later than expected? It's dark outside and, of course, you didn't leave the lights on. You struggle to get the key in the door and, once you open it, you have to feel around the wall for the light switch. Then, room by dark room, you repeat those steps.

Wouldn't it be easier to tap an app on your phone while you're still in your car and turn on all the lights?

Lightbulb makers sell bulbs that you can link to the rest of your smart house. For example, with Philips' Hue LED lights and Philips Hue Bridge smart home device ($60; Amazon affiliate link), you can remotely turn on or off dozens of lightbulbs in and around your house.

These lights are also dimmable, so you can have softer lighting at night, or they can wake you up gently by turning on slowly in the morning. You can even sync your lightbulbs to your streaming music or movies. For example, you can program your Philips lightbulbs to dim automatically for optimal viewing when you turn on Netflix.

Bonus: ""Hey, Siri. Turn on the lights."" You can connect your Philips Hue lightbulbs to Apple's IoT hub, the Apple HomeKit. With it, you can use Apple's voice-activated assistant, Siri, to turn your lights on and off with voice commands.

3. A smart lock for your smart home

If you have a connected car, you may already be remotely turning it on or unlocking your doors without even touching your key ring. Cars are increasingly equipped with Internet-connected technology, so you can do things like unlock the doors when you've got an armful of groceries.

The same concept is at work in IoT homes. For instance, you can remotely lock and unlock your doors. Smart locks, like Kwikset's Kevo ($160; Amazon link) are Bluetooth-connected, too.

With Kevo and its smartphone app, you can program your home locks so only your family members can unlock the doors. You can set the times of day when they can unlock the doors, and you can give your house guests temporary access to your home. No keys required.

Once your family, guests and you have downloaded the Kevo app to your smartphones, you don't even need to take it out of your pocket or purse to unlock your doors. Just touch the lock with your finger, and it'll unlock.

4. Keeping things fresh

If you roll your eyes at the idea of smart appliances like a smart refrigerator, that's understandable. Why would you need a fridge that connects to the Internet? Actually, there are a few good reasons.

LG, for example, has SmartDiagnosis. If your LG smart appliance is on the fritz, it will connect you with LG's customer service department by phone, or with a smartphone app. The repair techs can tell you what's wrong and help you get it fixed fast.

Then there's food tracking. You can get alerts you when you need to restock an item or when an item is about to expire. Samsung's upcoming Family Hub refrigerator even has cameras inside, so you can check what's on its shelves while you're out grocery shopping.

5. A house that cleans itself

If you've ever been vacuuming and wished you had Rosie from the Jetsons around to help out, you can stop wishing. Roomba made its name with robotic vacuums that keep your house clean without you lifting a finger. But its latest model is the smartest yet.

The Roomba 980 ($899) has a Wi-Fi connection that lets you control it with a smartphone app no matter where you are. You can remotely tell Roomba to start vacuuming, and on its dashboard you can see what its been doing while you were out.

Plus, the 980 fixes one of Roomba's most frustrating faults. If you've ever used a Roomba, or another robotic vacuum, you can watch it clean and clean one section of your house and continually miss a spot. That's frustrating, but now it's been fixed: Using its cameras and sensors, Roomba creates a map of the room it's cleaning so it knows if it hasn't covered everything.

Bonus: Prepare for the future

One of the biggest hurdles to a true smart home is that most gadgets stand alone or work only with gadgets from the same company. That's why smart home hubs are going to be important.

Instead of tapping an app to unlock your door, then another app to put on your lights and yet another app to turn off your home security system, you just do all that from a single spot. There are plenty of companies pushing their own hubs.

But be sure to do your research on what gadgets will connect before you commit to one. Apple's HomeKit, for example, works with non-Apple gadgets, but only if they're HomeKit compatible. Some gadgets you buy might not be. Companies like Cassia and HomeGenie are creating third-party hubs and software that try to work with everything, but they, too, may not be fully compatible.

Whatever you choose, just keep in mind that it's still the early days of the smart gadget revolution. So enjoy what they can do, but don't be too surprised if everything changes in a year or two.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,A video of park ranger helping poachers find wildlife to hunt goes viral,[],"A video showing a park ranger at Nahuel Huapi National Park guiding poachers to where they would find wild animals, which they afterwards slaughtered, has aroused indignation throughout Argentina.

In the images, which racked up some 10,000 views in just a few hours after being posted Thursday on Facebook, park ranger Ariel Llul appeared with the two hunters eating fish from Lake Falkner, which is part of the park, and killing a deer, two prohibited practices.

Llul was sentenced at a time when the images were also being recorded, in March 2014, of document falsification and for allowing poachers to enter the park, though the Neuquen provincial supreme court overturned the conviction a year later, citing irregularities both in the raid and the investigation of the documents.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Pope Francis says contraception is acceptable to contain Zika epidemic,[],"As the Zika crisis continues to spread across the globe, Pope Francis suggested on Thursday that women threatened with the virus could use artificial contraception, adding that ""avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil.""

The pope unequivocally rejected abortion as a response to the crisis in remarks made Wednesday as he flew home after a five-day trip to Mexico.

But he drew a parallel to a decision by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s to approve giving nuns in Belgian Congo artificial contraception to prevent pregnancies because they were being systematically raped.

Abortion ""is an evil in and of itself, but it is not a religious evil at its root, no? It's a human evil,"" Francis told reporters. ""On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil. In certain cases, as in this one (Zika), such as the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear.""

Francis was responding to a reporter's question about whether abortion or birth control could be considered a ""lesser evil"" when confronting the Zika crisis in Brazil, where there has been a spike in babies born with abnormally small heads to Zika-infected mothers.

The World Health Organization has declared a worldwide health emergency over the Zika virus and its suspected link to birth defects. On Thursday, the U.N. agency advised the sexual partners of pregnant women to use condoms or abstain from sex if they live in or have visited Zika-affected areas, echoing a recommendation made by U.S. health officials. The virus has been reported in at least 34 countries, most of them in overwhelmingly Catholic Latin America and the Caribbean, where access to birth control is often limited and abortion is heavily restricted.

Theologians and some Latin American bishops cautioned the pope was not giving a green light for Catholics to use artificial birth control, nor did his remarks amount to a change in church teaching.

But Francis' comments suggest that Catholics under specific circumstances could make a ""conscience-based decision about whether they should prevent pregnancy,"" said the Rev. James Bretzke, a moral theologian at Boston College.

""Certainly Pope Francis should have anticipated a question on the church's response to the Zika virus, and from his answer I believe he was well-prepared to field this query,"" Bretzke said. ""His comment on the Zika virus and measures to avoid pregnancy is within perfect consistency with the traditional moral teaching of the Catholic Church.""

U.N. officials have called on Latin American countries to loosen their abortion laws to allow women to terminate pregnancies if they fear the fetus may be at risk for microcephaly, a rare birth defect that causes brain damage and may be linked to the virus.

But Francis told reporters, ""Taking one life to save another, that's what the Mafia does. It's a crime. It's an absolute evil.""

Several Latin American churchmen have reasserted the church's opposition to abortion and artificial contraception as more reports of Zika cases and brain-damaged babies emerged.

On Thursday, Bishop Noel Antonio Londono of the Diocese of Jerico in the Colombian state of Antioquia, said nobody should interpret the pope's remarks as free license to use birth control.

""This isn't a blank check,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly, with regards to Zika, there are people who need to protect themselves.""

Bishop Miguel Angel Cabello, of Concepcion, Paraguay, said it was too early to know exactly what Francis meant.

""We need more studies on the Zika virus and its consequences"" before any decisions on church policy are made, he said. ""The pope made a comment and we should take it as a comment.""

Francis has tended to downplay the fraught moral hand-wringing over sexual ethics that preoccupied his predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He has said the church shouldn't be ""obsessed"" with such issues.

Coming home from Africa last year, Francis dismissed a question about whether condoms could be used in the fight against AIDS, saying there were far more pressing issues in Africa, such as poverty and exploitation, and that only when those problems were resolved should questions about condoms and AIDS take center stage.

Angelica Rivas, of the Feminist Collective for Social Development in El Salvador, said the pope's latest remarks would not be much help since the church in her country has consistently opposed sex education on the use of contraception, and birth control would not help the many women who are already pregnant.

""We have to give them the alternative of interrupting the pregnancy,"" Rivas said.

In Ecuador, Jaime Pallares, a spokesman for the Mother Mary and Queen Catholic lay group, said that as a believer he follows the word of the pope. But on this issue, he personally differs.

""It's difficult for me to interpret the Holy Father's sentiment. From my perspective the best alternative would be to maintain some days of chastity,"" said Pallares. ""I'm not going to die of chastity.""

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Syrian residents weary of reports on provisional truce,[],"Residents of the Syrian capital expressed skepticism on Monday about reports that a ""provisional agreement"" has been reached for a truce, a day after a wave of Islamic State bombings killed about 130 people in government-held areas near Damascus and beyond.

Details of the tentative cease-fire, announced in Jordan on Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, have not been made public. Even if a truce were to take hold, the Islamic State is not party to any such cease-fires or negotiations for a truce.

In a possible sign of some breakthrough, the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement Monday saying that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kerry spoke two more times by telephone on Sunday evening and during the course of their conversations agreed on the parameters for the cease-fire in Syria.

The statement said these parameters were then reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Barack Obama. No further details were immediately available.

Sunday's blasts that ripped through the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus and the central city of Homs were among the deadliest bombings in government-held areas in Syria's devastating five-year civil war.

The Islamic State group claimed both attacks. The extremists are dug in on the outskirts of the two cities and have repeatedly targeted pro-government strongholds.

The mood in government-controlled Damascus was weary on Monday. Inside the Hamidiyeh Souk, a popular bazaar which is typically crowded with shoppers, people said they were worried that a ceasefire would not be evenly observed and could leave the Syrian authorities vulnerable.

""I hope there will be no ceasefire. Because if there is a ceasefire, Turks will increase their support for criminals and traitors,"" said Ahmad Al-Omar from the northern Aleppo province, adding that Turkey may seek to let opposition fighters in via its border with Syria.

Others at the bazaar echoed President Bashar Assad's statements that a ceasefire could give an advantage to rebel forces and also the Islamic State group.

""I believe that those proposals now are ... a pretext to stop the advance of the Syrian army which is trying to liberate the homeland,"" said Ahmad Al-Issa.

Sunday's blasts came as Kerry announced that a ""provisional agreement"" has been reached on a cessation of hostilities that could begin in the next few days. But he acknowledged that it's not finalized and all parties might not automatically comply.

Kerry declined to go into the details of the agreement, saying it ""is not yet done.""

""The modalities for a cessation of hostilities are now being completed,"" Kerry said, adding that it was ""possible over the course of these next hours.""

The Damascus authorities said the government was ready to take part in a truce as long as it is not used by militants to reinforce their positions. Syrian troops, backed by Russian warplanes are on a major offensive in the northern Aleppo province, trying to seal the border with Turkey, a key supporter of the rebels, before any truce is reached.

Meanwhile, the Syrian government's supply route by land to the city of Aleppo was cut by heavy fighting Monday as the army, supported by allied militias and the Russian air force, fought to consolidate its recent gains in the northern province.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of contacts to monitor the war, said Islamic militias assaulted government-held positions around Khanaser, a town southeast of Aleppo, setting off intense clashes that have lasted through the day. Khanaser lies along the government's only access route to Aleppo.

Aleppo, Syria's largest city and one-time commercial center, is divided between the government and its opponents, while ISIS holds a wide front to the east of the city.

Fighting has been fierce in Aleppo province in recent weeks amid a government offensive to cut off the rebel stronghold.

The Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement on Monday condemning Sunday's bomb blasts in Damascus and Homs and calling for a ""proper, principled response"" from the international community to prevent terrorist groups from further aggravating the situation in Syria and inciting sectarian strife.

""The brutal crimes by extremists are aimed at intimidating the civilian population and undermining attempts to achieve a lasting political settlement of the Syrian crisis in the interests of all Syrians and efforts to end the violence and bloodshed,"" the Russian statement said.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Evo Morales headed to narrow defeat in reelection referendum, exit polls show",[],"Evo Morales' bid to extend his presidency by amending the constitution heads toward a narrow defeat, according to a referendum's early results released Monday morning.

Morales has governed Bolivia for a decade and is seeking a fourth term starting in 2019.

The referendum's timing could not have been worse for Morales, the country's first indigenous president. He was stung this month by an influence-peddling scandal involving a former lover and by a deadly incident of political violence.

Two unofficial ""quick counts"" by polling firms that looked at counts from a sampling of polling stations said 52 percent voted ""no."" One firm, Ipsos-Apoyo, said it saw ballots at one of every 15 polling stations.

Official vote counting was slow. With just 23 percent polling stations reporting just after midnight, the ""no"" vote stood at 67 percent. But vote reports were particularly slow in coming from the countryside, where Morales is most popular. State television halted election coverage shortly before midnight.

A frustrated Vice President Alvaro Garcia said at a news conference Sunday night that the vote was so far ""a technical tie""  too close to call.

""No one has won, nor has anyone lost,"" he said. Morales did not make an appearance.

Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington, called the tight vote a surprising, major blow to Morales, who tallied more than 60 percent in his 2014 re-election.

""While few can deny that Bolivia has seen impressive economic growth and social progress under Morales' rule, many voters are sending a message that it is not enough  they are demanding clean government, accountability and more competitive politics,"" Shifter said.

Morales, who entered politics as a coca growers union leader, could now be motivated to groom a successor, he added.

Bolivia's constitution, enacted in Morales' initial term, permits presidents and vice presidents to serve two consecutive terms. Morales' first term was deemed by a high court not to have counted.

International observers reported only minor irregularities in Sunday's vote.

The referendum followed by days a political bombshell: A former lover of Morales was named sales manager of a Chinese company in 2013 that has obtained nearly $500 million in mostly no-bid state contracts. Morales denied any impropriety and his claim to have last seen the woman in 2007 was questioned when a picture of them together last year emerged.

The case deepened doubts about the integrity of Morales' governing Movement Toward Socialism, which has been wracked by scandals.

Adding to Morales' woes, six city workers died of smoke inhalation last week in El Alto, the teeming city adjacent to the capital of La Paz, in an attack blamed on pro-Morales agitators. The attackers torched documents that allegedly incriminated the previous mayor in payroll corruption.

Both developments blighted Morales' achievements in cutting poverty, spreading Bolivia's natural resource wealth and empowering its indigenous majority during a decade in office.

Eusebio Condori, a retired schoolteacher, said he voted ""no"" because the scandal and the deaths ""confirm that this government doesn't have a plan for Bolivia, only for itself.""

A mother of three, Maria Espinoza, said she voted ""no"" because she believes in term limits. She echoed the complaint of others that too many jobs depend on political patronage.

South America's left has recently been sullied by scandal  and punished at the ballot box in Argentina and Venezuela  but Morales had personally remained unscathed.

His movement has been discredited, however, by the skimming of millions from the government-managed Fondo Indigena, which runs agricultural and public works in the countryside.

Morales presided over an unprecedented economic boom as prices for raw materials soared just as he took office.

He built airports, highways and the pride of La Paz, an Austrian-built aerial tramway system. He also put a Chinese-built satellite into space. Average per capita income rose from $873 to $3,119 and a new indigenous middle class was born.

But the boom is over. Bolivia's revenues from natural gas and minerals, making up three-fourths of its exports, were down 32 percent last year.

Economists say Morales leaned heavily on extractive industries to pay for populist programs and failed to diversify the economy.

In addition, judicial corruption has been endemic and press freedom suffered as major news outlets were purchased by people friendly to the government. Critical media and environmentalists complained of harassment by the state.

The moment we take a drug  whether we snort, smoke, or swallow it  our bodies begin to break it down. In the process, metabolites, or byproducts, of the drug are produced, which can linger in our blood, urine (and even in our hair) for long after the initial effects of the drug are felt. Traces of these metabolites are what drug testers look for, since they're a good indication that someone has actually used a drug rather than merely come into accidental contact with it.

And while hair-based drug tests are fairly accurate, tests of blood and urine are simply unable to detect the vast majority of drugs, so long as you haven't used for about a week. Heroin, for example, is generally undetectable in urine after three to five days.

As the chart below shows, traces of drugs like LSD, morphine, heroin, amphetamines, and alcohol all remain in the blood for just 12 hours or less:

For urine, the window of detectibility is a little bit wider  roughly three to six days for LSD, MDMA, and morphine, for example  and up to 30 days for marijuana:

Siamak Namazi, 44, was detained by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps while visiting family. Namazi immigrated to the U.S. in 1983 and returned to Iran after graduating college to serve in Iran's military.

Iranian authorities have not publicly announced any charges against Namazi. However, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, who claimed to be Namazi's attorney, said in a phone interview with Reuters Friday that he had not received permission to see his client.

Reuters also reported that Namazi's mother, Effie, said that she had learned from her son's cellmate's family that Siamak had begun a hunger strike.

""As a mother I ask officials to at least allow for me and his father to meet with Siamak as soon as possible and jointly convince him to quit his hunger strike,"" she wrote on Facebook.

Police spokesman Maj. Midge Boyle said that investigators have reviewed medical records provided by Colleen Crowley, Manziel's ex-girlfriend. Crowley told police Manziel hit her and dragged her into a car in late January.

Manziel hasn't been charged, but a judge has issued Crowley a protection order against him.

Police haven't interviewed Manziel, but spoke to several other witnesses. Boyle says police want to have their strongest case against Manziel before speaking to him.

Some defense lawyers have questioned whether Manziel is getting special treatment and another suspect facing similar allegations might already have been arrested. Boyle said the detective investigating the allegations ''hasn't gotten all the facts yet.''

Super Bowl MVP Von Miller, a friend of Manziel's who also attended Texas A&M, said he thinks Manziel will turn things around.

MLB

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Ken Griffey Jr. says steroid-tainted slugger Barry Bonds deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, and Bonds agrees.

Griffey served as honorary starter for the Daytona 500, where he waived the green flag to start the 58th running of ''The Great American Race.''

Before he took his spot in the starter's stand, he met with the media, and one of the first questions was about Bonds belonging in Cooperstown.

After a long pause, Griffey said ''Yeah. I think that overall, when you look what people have done, yeah. It's not my vote, so I can't vote for him. But if you look at what he's done, those numbers speak for themselves.''

The polarizing home run king, Bonds is returning to the major leagues as hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. Bonds is 0 for 4 in annual Hall of Fame balloting.

''There's not one player that ever could say I'm not one,'' Bonds said Saturday. ''There's not a coach who ever coached me who says I'm not one. In my heart and soul, and God knows, I'm a Hall of Famer.''

Griffey was elected to the Hall last month.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A divorce case involving a Louisville donor and trustee is seeking testimony and documentation from Texas football coach Charlie Strong.

The case involves Louisville trustee Jonathan Blue and wife Tracy Blue. Attorneys for Jonathan Blue want text messages and phone bills from Strong's cellphone as well as calendar, travel and other records. Strong was coach at Louisville from 2010-2013 before he was hired at Texas.

In a statement, Strong said he was recently informed of a marital dispute ''between a couple I know.''

Strong says he is ''not a party to their divorce'' and has received no court order. He said he would not comment further on the legal case.

Strong is one of several witnesses that Jonathan Blue wants deposed. Strong promised Texas fans the case would not interfere with team preparations for the 2016 season.

SOCCER

NEW YORK (AP) - The United States will play Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay in the first round of the Centennial Copa America, a special 16-nation tournament whose business deals led to the indictment of a slew of top soccer executives on corruption charges.

The Americans were drawn Sunday night to open the tournament June 3 against Colombia at Santa Clara, California, rematch of a famous 1994 World Cup game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The U.S. upset the Colombians 2-1, a result that led 10 days later to the murder of Andres Escobar, a 27-year-old Colombian defender who deflected a pass from John Harkes into his net for an own goal.

After the opener, the U.S. plays Costa Rica four days later at Chicago, then closes Group A play against Paraguay at Philadelphia on June 11.

The top two teams in each of four groups advance to the quarterfinals of the tournament, which will be played at 10 U.S. venues from June 3-26. The semifinals are in Houston and Chicago, and the championship is at East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Continue Reading Below

Phone makers face another tough year in 2016 as subdued global growth and persisting currency weakness in key emerging markets sap consumers' spending power. A push by Chinese manufacturers to expand overseas amid slowing growth in their domestic market may also undercut margins further.

In a bid to recapture market share, Samsung launched two new versions of its Galaxy S smartphone and brought in Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg for a surprise appearance to tout the potential of virtual reality, prompting hundreds of people to rush to the stage to record the moment.

LG, which lost money from its mobile business last year as its flagship products struggled, introduced a modular design to its new G5 smartphones that allows users to replace or upgrade functions such as camera and audio independently.

It also launched a virtual reality headset and accessories including a drone controller to pair with the G5.

Analysts and investors cheered LG's features, which they said were different enough to possibly revive sales, but were lukewarm about Samsung's offerings, saying they only featured incremental upgrades.

""I think it's possible for LG's mobile business to recover on its new product launch, since they delivered significant changes with the G5,"" said Seoul-based HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon.

""The Galaxy S7, however, doesn't seem to be creating as much buzz,"" Park said.

Samsung shares were down 1.3 percent as of 0212 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market , while LG shares were up 3 percent.

Revamps could prove key to smartphone makers as 2016 shapes up to be another tough year: researcher TrendForce expects the smartphone market growth to slow to 8.1 percent from 10.3 percent a year earlier.

Margin pressures are also expected to intensify for the industry as Chinese manufacturers seek to expand overseas to counter slowing domestic demand.

Samsung on Saturday said its mobile payments service, Samsung Pay, will launch in China in March, a month after Apple launched its Apple Pay service in the world's biggest smartphone market.

The company fell out of the top five in the world's top smartphone market last year but hopes that its easy-to-use payments service will help it regain sales momentum.

""The challenge you have got in the smartphone market is breaking through all that sameness. From a design and functionality perspective, everything looks and feels the same,"" said Bob O'Donnell, president of Technalysis Research.

""So the challenge is finding things that stick out.""

It's a discovery that rocked the archaeological world -- scientists working at Moropeng, the site outside Johannesburg known as the 'Cradle of Humankind,' discovered a mass underground cave housing the remains of hundreds of individuals that the researchers say belong to a new species of the human family. Researchers named the creature Homo naledi. That reflects the ""Homo"" evolutionary group, which includes modern people and our closest extinct relatives, and the word for ""star"" in a local language. The find was made in the Rising Star cave system.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Arsenal's eyes on strike trio as Barcelona comes to town,[],"In Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, Arsenal faces the most potent strike force in the game  and a team that will probably be more than halfway to the Champions League quarterfinals after Tuesday's match.

Tactically and physically, Barcelona will ensure the first leg at Emirates Stadium will be one of the toughest matches the hosts have faced in a very long time.

Arsenal's attacking football has taken the team to the last 16 of the Champions League, third place in the Premier League title race and the fifth round of the FA Cup. But it would be a high-risk approach against Barcelona and the likelihood is that Arsene Wenger's priority will be to avoid defeat.

A few things to know about Tuesday's match:

___

MESSI RECORD

Messi brings not only his exceptional talent but also an impressive track record against Arsenal into Tuesday's game.

Barcelona has beaten Arsenal in their two previous meetings in the knockout stages, with Messi scoring all four goals at the Camp Nou in 2010 as the hosts romped to a 4-1 victory on the night and a 6-3 win on aggregate.

The following season, Messi scored twice in a 3-1 victory that put the home side through 4-3 on aggregate.

Only a torn hamstring kept him out of the 2006 final, when Barcelona came back to beat a 10-man Arsenal side 2-1 in Paris.

___

LETHAL COMPLICITY

It's no secret that Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suarez and Neymar get on very well  on and off the pitch.

""Although they are different characters, on the pitch they are pure harmony,"" Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic said. ""It may sound like an exaggeration, but I say Messi, Suarez and Neymar are the best friends in the world, possibly the best in the history of football.""

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also highlighted the trio's team spirit.

""They have a great solidarity,"" he said. ""Messi gave the ball to Suarez (from a penalty) because he wanted him to be the best goalscorer . when he (Messi) had the opportunity to score his 300th goal. That means there is something special there.""

___

SUAREZ'S SHADOW

While the spotlight is bound to fall on Messi, the threat posed by Suarez will not be lost on Arsenal, or the crowd.

His prolific three-year spell with Liverpool nearly won the Premier League for his former club in 2014, when he followed up by scoring both goals as Uruguay beat England 2-1 at the World Cup, effectively ending its hopes of progress from the group stage.

Suarez is in scintillating form this season for Barcelona, both domestically  where he is La Liga's top scorer with 25 goals  and in the Champions League, where he scored five goals in as many games.

Arsenal may well regret, yet again, the club's failed bid for him in the summer of 2013.

___

KNOWING RESPECT

Barcelona playmaker Andres Iniesta has been studying his Arsenal opponents and says he knows how challenging they can be.

Iniesta said Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta  with whom he grew up at Barcelona's famed La Masia youth academy  is a great player and ""in the youth ranks he was a team leader.""

Iniesta is also wary of former teammate Alexis Sanchez, whom he described as ""very unpredictable"" when attacking. ""He is physically strong and very capable,"" Iniesta said.

Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin is another product of the Barcelona youth academy.

___

SANCHEZ READY

Mesut Ozil, Aron Ramsey and Petr Cech will return for Arsenal after being rested for Saturday's goalless FA Cup draw with Hull, while Sanchez and Olivier Giroud are set to start after being on the bench.

Sanchez was lackluster as a substitute but manager Arsene Wenger has no doubts about the Chile international's readiness to face the side he left in 2014 after three years.

""Don't worry about Tuesday,"" Wenger said. ""He'll be tuned in. I think it's more focus. Sanchez, I don't think he was completely ready to come on.""

___

LUIS ENRIQUE'S GOALS

Luis Enrique takes on Arsenal for the first time as Barcelona's coach. However, during the midfielder's playing career, he scored in both matches when the clubs et in the group stage of the Champions Leaue in 1999.

He scored in a 1-1 first-leg draw at the Nou Camp and then again in a 4-2 win at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal's temporary home for Champions League matches.

foxnews,2016-01-25 00:00:00,Mini T. Rex: 'Welsh Dragon' may be earliest Jurassic dinosaur,[],"Two brothers hunting for ichthyosaur fossils along the coast of the United Kingdom came across something far more astounding: The bones of what may be the earliest known dinosaur from the Jurassic period in the U.K., and possibly even the world, a new study finds.

After finding the bones in 2014, Rob Hanigan contacted his brother, Nick. The two scoured the coast, located just south of Wales, for more of the fossils, taking careful geological notes along the way.

Later, they reached out to paleontologists at the University of Portsmouth, who confirmed that the bones belonged to a theropod, a group of mostly meat-eating dinosaurs. Moreover, the paleo-beast lived at a key point of dinosaur diversification at the beginning of the Jurassic, said study co-author Steven Vidovic, a doctoral researcher of paleontology at the University of Portsmouth.

""It's a jumbled mix of bones that are a real puzzle to put back together,"" Vidovic told Live Science in an email. ""It was very rewarding reconstructing it.""

The researchers named the newfound species Dracoraptor hanigani, which roughly translates to ""dragon raptor."" (The dragon is the national symbol of Wales.) It also honors Nick and Rob Hanigan for the find and for donating the specimen to the ""Amgueddfa Cymru""  National Museum of Wales.

During its lifetime, about 201 million years ago, D. hanigani likely hunted or scavenged meat with its tiny, pointy teeth that measured less than 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) long. However, its teeth weren't yet full size. A bone analysis suggests that D. hanigani was likely a juvenile, largely because most of its bones had not yet fully formed or fused together, the researchers said.

Given its young age, D. hanigani was a shrimp compared with other theropods. Though its distant relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, stood up to 13 feet (4 meters) tall and measured up to 40 feet (12.3 m) long, D. hanigani stood only about 2.3 feet (70 centimeters) tall and measured about 6.5 feet (200 cm) long.

The newfound dinosaur also sported a long tail, possibly to help with balance, the researchers said.

Little is known about dinosaurs during the earliest days of the Jurassic period, Vidovic added. ""This is some of the very best fossil evidence that we have for this time,"" he said.

There are earlier dinosaur fossils dating to the Triassic period (between 251 million and 199 million years ago) in the United Kingdom. But the timing of this early Jurassic skeleton is important: The end-Triassic extinction led to the demise of more than 75 percent of all marine and land life, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. This extinction event, which wiped out so many others, likely helped dinosaurs diversify and multiply, Vidovic said.

""About 200 million years later, the [newfound] dinosaur looks a little generic, but at the time in the early Jurassic, it was quite new and different,"" Vidovic said. ""So the reason it might look a bit generic in hindsight is that loads of later dinosaurs repeated the winning formula.""

The study was published online today (Jan. 20) in the journal PLOS ONE.

The group said it released the info Sunday night in response to Wednesdays shooting death of Paul Gaston, a black man, by three white Cincinnati cops. By 4:30 a.m. Monday the video had been taken down, according to WLWT.

Thin Blue Line, your game is over, an Anonymous figure said in the video, according to a transcript. You lost. While we release your officers information, we will hold no responsibility of the actions of those that see the information.

That information included names, ages, street addresses, email addresses and social media accounts, as well as the names and addresses of officers family members. Its unclear if the information was obtained via a data breach or through publicly available sources, Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders told Cincinnati.com.

The incident that prompted the Anonymous action involved the somewhat contentious details surrounding Gastons death. While video of the incident shows Gaston initially on his knees with his hands behind his head as cops approach him, police said he reached toward his waistband for what they believed to be a weapon before they shot him. Video evidence appears to back up the officers assertions. After his death, authorities discovered Gaston was carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon.

Anonymous included footage of the shooting  which police had previously released  as part of its video message.

Of these, one was offered for sale to the public to help raise funds for charity. The auction took place last night at Christies in London and the winning bid came in at 2,434,500 (approximately $3,478,700). All proceeds from the sale will go to benefit Medecins Sans Frontieres.

The mystery buyer now owns a true piece of automotive history. Furthermore, although there were 10 DB10s built, many are in poor condition due to the rigors of filming. The one that just went under the hammer is one of only two show cars left unmodified. This is because it was mostly used for close-up camera work and display purposes.

The DB10 is based on Aston Martins Vantage sports car and maintains the production models 4.7-liter V-8. Peak output is 420 horsepower and drive is to the rear wheels only, via a six-speed manual transmission.

Though this particular example is in full working condition, since its not homologated, certified or approved for use on any public roads it cant be registered for road use. It does quality for Aston Martins Assured Provenance registry, though.

For Jeb Bushs campaign, August was a cruel month. Donald Trumps attacks on the former Florida governor as a low-energy politician were beginning to stick, and the two were bickering over immigration. The issue before the Bush team was what to do about it.

Some advisers argued for an aggressive response, even to the point of challenging Trump to some kind of one-on-one confrontation. Others resisted, believing Trumps candidacy was unsustainable, while some cautioned against getting into a pigpen with a pig, as one adviser recalled.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"FBI owes it to victims to access San Bernardino killer's phone, director says",[],"FBI Director James Comey said late Sunday that the agency owed the victims of last December's San Bernardino terror attack a ""thorough and professional investigation"" in an effort to explain why law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help them gain access to a cellphone owned by one of the gunmen.

In a post on the Lawfare blog, Comey wrote that the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

The post was Comey's first public statement since Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into Syed Farook's work-issued iPhone. Farook, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in the Dec. 2 attacks.

On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with the court order. Early Monday, Cook sent an email to Apple employees saying that the FBI should withdraw its demand.

In the message, subject-lined ""Thank you for your support,"" Cook states that the company has ""no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists"" and believes abiding by the judge's order would be unlawful, an expansion of government powers, and would set a dangerous precedent that would essentially create a backdoor to the encrypted iPhone.



""This case is about much more than a single phone or a single investigation,"" Cook wrote, ""so when we received the government's order we knew we had to speak out.""



""At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone's civil liberties.""

Apple also points to the difficulty of keeping such a ""master key"" safe once it has been created. The government has said that Apple could keep the specialized technology it would create to help officials hack the phone -- bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.

If the company's engineers were to do as ordered, Apple would do its best to protect the technology, but Cook said the company ""would be relentlessly attacked by hackers and cybercriminals.""



In his blog post, Comey had written, ""The San Bernardino litigation isn't about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.

""The relief we seek is limited and its value increasingly obsolete because the technology continues to evolve,"" Comey continued. ""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That's it.""

Comey did acknowledge in his statement that the clash has laid bare a tension between privacy and security. But he said that divide should not be resolved by the FBI nor ""corporations that sell stuff for a living.""

""It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before,"" he said.

Cook's question-and-answer posting acknowledged that it is technically possible for Apple to do what the judge ordered, but that it's ""something we believe is too dangerous to do."" U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers said Friday that Apple has followed court orders to unlock phones at least 70 times in various cases.

Apple has until Feb. 26 to file its opposition to the initial order.

A Clinton campaign report by Latino Decisions, however, said the results didnt add up and the former secretary of state balked at Sanders claim of winning the Latino vote.

We don't believe that the so-called entry polls were particularly accurate,"" Clinton said. ""Look at the precincts...Look at where we dominated.""

The Latino Decisions data shows that Clinton won the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants and in precincts 4560 and 4559, both in the crucial Clark County and over 80 percent Latino, Clinton won seven and twelve delegates to Sanders one and four.

Clinton also won all the caucuses held in the casinos, which brought in the predominantly Latino workers on break from their jobs.

The battle over the who the Latino vote in Nevada is critical as the campaign season marches on, with Sanders trying prove that his campaign has more support than just white, liberal voters and Clinton hoping to keep a broad coalition of minority voters at her side as voting turns to states like Texas, Colorado, Arizona and Florida.

Despite citing progress with Latinos in Nevada, Sanders advisers are clear-eyed about the challenges on Super Tuesday. They are mapping out plans to stay close to Clinton in the delegate count until the race turns to friendlier territory later in March.

""Because we can do the long game, once we get past March 1, the calendar changes dramatically,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""It's frontloaded for her, but we have the ability to stay in the long game.""

More than half the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination will be determined in the 28 states that hold primaries and caucuses in March.

Clinton and Sanders should have enough money to stay in the race for weeks afterward, but the delegate tally at the end of the month could make the results inevitable.

For Sanders, strong showings in March are more important because of Clinton's lead with superdelegates  the party leaders who can support any candidates regardless of how their states vote.

Clinton has captured the support of 451 superdelegates compared with Sanders' 19.

While Sanders was campaigning in South Carolina on Sunday, he planned to be in Massachusetts for a college rally and campaign in Norfolk, Virginia, on Tuesday.

Clinton also was spending time in Super Tuesday states. She flew from Nevada on Saturday to Texas, a huge delegate prize, for a late-night rally in Houston. She planned to raise money in California and then campaign in South Carolina.

Beyond Super Tuesday, Clinton and Sanders are looking ahead to the March 15 contests in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. Big wins in those states for either candidate would put the nomination within sight.

Clinton's support among black voters could pay dividends because of the way Democrats award high-performing congressional districts with a greater share of delegates.

Many of the most delegate-rich states have large minority populations, including Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois and Florida, giving Clinton an inside track to accumulate delegates in March.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Hamlin felt for teammate Kenseth after snatching Daytona 500,[],"Four drivers went into the Daytona 500 determined to end Joe Gibbs' 23-year losing skid in NASCAR's biggest race of the year.

So when Matt Kenseth took the white flag, Denny Hamlin was determined to help his teammate get to victory lane. Only the move he made to defend for Kenseth led to Hamlin winning the closest Daytona 500 in history.

His decision to jump out of line to block a charge from Kevin Harvick instead led Harvick to push Hamlin enough to catch Kenseth. He staved off Kenseth's attempt to block, then wedged in between Kenseth and Martin Truex Jr. and beat Truex to the checkered flag by 0.010 seconds.

Even as he celebrated his first Daytona 500 victory, Hamlin felt for his teammate.

""This is a great moment for me, but I feel awful for Matt because he's such a great friend, such a great teammate,"" Hamlin said. ""I'm just so proud of all my other teammates for us being so committed to each other for 500 miles. That was very rare that you see the selflessness that you saw, even with two laps to go. All of us were committed to pushing (Kenseth) to a victory.

""I saw (Harvick) coming. I said, 'If I didn't make a run, he was going to make a run just like I did.' I went up there to block, he hit me so hard it shot me three cars forward. It's crazy, it happened so fast.""

The victory ended Gibbs' 23-year drought at the Daytona 500. It gave Hamlin his first Daytona 500 victory in 10 tries, and Toyota its first in ""The Great American Race.""

""It's the pinnacle of my career, for sure,"" said Hamlin.

Gibbs, who in November celebrated with Kyle Busch the team's first Sprint Cup title in a decade, won the race for the first time since Dale Jarrett in 1993.

Gibbs had made it clear that he had no use for the victories his drivers collected in the exhibition races leading into Sunday's season-opener  Hamlin and Busch each won one race in the buildup to the opener. But the three-time Super Bowl-winning coach was focused only on the 500 and his four drivers brainstormed on the best way to get a win.

""The thrill in football, you can't get any more excited than that, winning a Super Bowl. It's the same thrill over here,"" Gibbs said. ""Most people never get to have a dream in life. I've had two from an occupational standpoint. I'm probably one of the most blessed guys in the world.""

Hamlin, Kenseth, Busch and Carl Edwards stuck close together for most of the race, and they got assistance from Truex, who became a de facto JGR teammate this year when Furniture Row Racing moved to Toyota.

Kenseth led Truex until the final lap when Hamlin finally jumped out of line. Starting a second line on the outside, Hamlin got a push from Kevin Harvick that allowed him to catch Kenseth. Kenseth tried to throw a block but Hamlin wedged into the middle between Kenseth and Truex, and Kenseth had to save his car from wrecking.

""The last thing I wanted to do was wreck off turn four with my Toyota teammates and none of us win,"" Hamlin said. ""We had talked about a plan overnight to just work together, work together and I've never seen it executed so flawlessly.

""I said with two to go that we have to get the team victory no matter what it takes and I essentially was trying to go up there and block (Harvick) to keep him from getting to those guys.""

Truex wasn't sure what he could have done differently.

""It hurts a little bit,"" Truex said. ""I think the only thing I should have done different was been a little more aggressive coming to the line, holding Denny up the race track. That last split second when he pulled off my door, that was it. It gave him that couple inches to beat me to the line.

""It's hard to make those decisions. Live and learn. I think if I get in that position again, I'll do it a little bit differently.""

Toyotas swept the podium as Truex was second, and Busch third. Edwards was fifth to give Toyota four of the top five spots. It comes three months after Busch gave Toyota its first championship.

""This was our 10th try at the Daytona 500,"" said David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development, who called the win the biggest in Toyota history  trumping even the 2003 Indianapolis 500 victory.

""When we came into the sport, we struggled. We were not ready. We didn't know. And so it's taken time for us to collectively build an organization of winning races and competing for championships.""

Kenseth faded to 14th.

""They don't get much more crushing than that,"" Kenseth said. ""If I can't win, I want my teammate to win. There's a million things you could do differently, but I did what I thought I should do at the time to try to win. We finished terrible, but that was the move I thought I had to make to try to preserve the win.""","['kenseth', 'teammate', 'daytona', 'snatching', 'harvick', 'win', 'felt', 'toyota', 'hamlin', 'race', 'truex', '500', 'victory']"

According to the People's Online Daily, the women were trying to fly from southwest Chinas Chongqing to Hangzhou, the capital of eastern Zhejiang province on Hainan Airlines this past Sunday when inclement weather delayed their flight.

The airline offered a complementary a room overnight at a nearby hotel when they were then told the weather conditions had worsened and their flight was not leaving until 3pm the next day.

The problem was the hotel was a per-hour, short-stay love hotel that had sex chairs, chains, and wrist and ankle cuffs.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Brain fitness program may ease cognitive impairment in elderly,[],"Many elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment experienced better brain function after a ""fitness"" program designed to sharpen their minds, a U.S. study suggests.

Researchers put 127 elderly people on what they called a brain fitness regimen for 12 weeks that included meditation training, cognitive behavior therapy, and education about the Mediterranean diet, exercise, stress reduction and proper sleep habits.

By the end of the program, 84% of participants experienced significant improvements in cognitive function, researchers reported in a paper released online February 5 in the Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.

Among the random sample of 17 patients who received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the beginning and end of the program, 12 had either no atrophy during the study or some growth in brain volume in their hippocampus, the region responsible for memory.

""You can choose a lifestyle that promotes rapid brain atrophy and dementia or one that accelerates brain growth and vitality,"" said lead study author Dr. Majid Fotuhi, a researcher at NeuroGrow Brain Fitness Center in McLean, Virginia, and at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

""You need to decide if you can make choices that will rejuvenate your brain on a daily basis,"" Fotuhi added by email.

Fotuhi and colleagues tested their brain fitness program in a group of elderly patients who were 71 years old on average.

At the start of the program, patients underwent standardized neurology evaluations to determine and address any potential medical causes for memory loss and cognitive impairment such as sleep apnea, depression or vitamin B12 deficiency.

Every participant also underwent MRI and brain mapping at the start of the program.

Then each week for the next three months, they all got two hours of cognitive skills training and neurofeedback therapy, which used sound and images to prompt the brain's circuits to work and then to rest. They also had one hour a week of counseling and coaching on lifestyle changes that are linked to better brain health.

Overall, 84% of patients had statistically significant improvements in at least three out of 10 areas of cognitive function, while another 9% had significant gains in at least two areas.

Among the subset of people who got follow-up MRIs at the end of the study, 9 of 17 patients had at least a 1% expansion in the volume of the hippocampus, enough to dial back the brain's age by several years and improve cognitive abilities.

Limitations of the study include the small size, the lack of randomization or a control group, and the difficulty of determining which of the many interventions may have been the most beneficial to cognitive function in elderly patients, the authors note.

""It is not yet proven how such an approach stalled atrophy or encouraged regrowth as measured by an increased volume,"" said Dr. Dale Bredesen, founding president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, in an email. Bredesen wasn't involved in the study.

Many of the elements of the brain fitness program may have benefits that go beyond memory or cognitive abilities, said Stephanie Peabody, a neuropsychologist at Harvard Medical School who wasn't involved in the study.

""Brain health is inextricably tied to overall health; those without injury to the brain and/or thought or mood disorders live a healthier lifestyle, have fewer chronic diseases and remain healthier into older age,"" Peabody said by email. ""Beyond this, those who optimize lifestyle behaviors including sleep, activity and nutrition are able to optimize almost all aspects of brain functioning.""","['function', 'lifestyle', 'cognitive', 'ease', 'elderly', 'volume', 'brain', 'patients', 'program', 'fitness', 'impairment', 'study']"

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Libya disaster: Have Western leaders learned anything?,['Pete Hoekstra'],"That the U.S. has launched airstrikes against ISIS in Libya should demonstrate once and for all the total disaster of the NATO-led adventure to overthrow Muammar al-Qaddafi in 2011.

Libya devolved into a failed state when NATO assisted Qaddafis radical jihadist opponents in killing him and then promptly abandoned the country. Left in the wake were two rival governments competing for power, which created space for Islamists to turn Libya into a cesspool of extremism.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to call the debacle American smart power at its best. Other presidential candidates still argue that it was the right thing to do.

How will the West ever learn anything if it cant identify its most obvious failures?

Libya has no central functioning government that can provide security for its citizens. ISIS fights to expand its caliphate along the Mediterranean to points as close as 200 miles from Europes vulnerable southern border. It controls Qaddafis hometown of Sirte. It has imposed Shariah law in the areas under its control. It exploits Libya as a base to export weapons, jihadists and ideology to Europe, other African countries and the Middle East.

Benghazi and Derna, which have long been hotbeds of radicalism, provided more fighters per capita to Afghanistan and Iraq than nearly any other area in the world. The difference between then and now is that Qaddafi kept the lid on the garbage can long before 2002-2003, when he became a reliable U.S. ally against radical Islam. He changed his behavior, gave up his nuclear weapons program, paid reparations to the victims of his atrocities and provided invaluable intelligence that disrupted numerous Islamist terror plots.

It represented a massive foreign policy success, and the U.S. thanked him by facilitating his murder.

Similarly, the West embraced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his struggles against Islamist forces, and then it threw him under the bus. Both Qaddafi and Mubarak did everything asked of them, but they ended up dead or in jail.

Any leader would really need to ask why he should trust NATO or the West. Is there any question why Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad does not negotiate an end to his countrys civil war and clings to Iran and Russia to keep him in power?

Iran cheated on its nuclear program for years. As a result, the U.S. gifted it with more than $100 billion  including $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars  and it hasnt changed its behavior in the slightest. In addition to its military ambitions, Iran will most assuredly spend the money on supporting Assad and its terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, Africa and, yes, Europe.

Im amazed by some of the statements now coming from the coalition. The French defense minister is concerned about ISIS fighters blending in with refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Talk about restating the obvious. The British want troops to identify friendly militias in order to avoid targeting them in future airstrikes. Has something changed where we have improved the vetting of moderate militia groups?

NATO failed miserably in Libya and in Syria the first time around. Whats different now?

The only official who seems to make any sense is U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who said recently, The Libyans dont welcome outsiders intruding on their territory. He was referring to ISIS, but he might as well have been talking about the West. Libyans have not forgotten that NATO all but vanished once Qaddafi was killed.

Western foreign policy is in disarray. The scariest part is that supposed leaders dont even know it, and therefore they cant admit to previous mistakes. Allies that brought stability to the region are gone. Former and current antagonists benefited from Western incompetence.

Who would have predicted six years ago that those rulers battling Islamist terror would be deposed and that those committing it would become the Wests new friends?

NATO snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Libya. Refugees flood Europe. Terrorist attacks continue to spread geographically and in lethality. The Syrian civil war rages on. Iran lavishes its newfound wealth on its nuclear program and campaign of global terror.

Is it any wonder that citizens in Western countries are frustrated and angry with those in positions of authority?

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,"A Mexican paradise called Sayulita, also known as the new Puerto Vallarta",[],"Located about 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta on Mexico's Pacific coast, Sayulita presents an alternative to the towering all-inclusive resorts that line the beaches south of it. However, all types of destinations in this part of Mexico are seeing bolstered tourist numbers. Direct flights from major U.S. cities have increased here. Passenger counts, both international and domestic, have risen as well.

Bookended by seaside rocks that protrude into warm Pacific Ocean waters, the relatively small Playa de los Muertos, or Beach of the Dead, features gentle waves, pelicans diving for fish and sunbathers lying on the sand. Vendors sell beer and grilled fish-on-a-stick, and two locals climb a palm tree to fetch coconuts.

But just beyond the laidback beach is a peninsula that hosts a new and posh 62-property development, highlighting that Sayulita, once a tranquil fishing village, continues to grow into one of Mexico's top tourism and retirement destinations.

The town was even featured in an offshoot of ABC's popular reality series ""The Bachelor: Paradise,"" though one local who watched the filming thought it was a telenovela.

""Every time I've said it can't get bigger, it does,"" said Jody Meacham of New Jersey after finishing a surfing session on Sayulita's main beach. Meacham has been visiting Sayulita for 25 years, back when there were ""more burros than cars."" ''I still love it. I come back every year,"" he said.

Located about 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta on Mexico's Pacific coast, Sayulita presents an alternative to the towering all-inclusive resorts that line the beaches south of it. However, all types of destinations in this part of Mexico are seeing bolstered tourist numbers. Direct flights from major U.S. cities have increased here. Passenger counts, both international and domestic, have risen as well.

In December, the federal Mexican tourism department named Sayulita a ""Pueblo Magico"" or ""Magic Town,"" positioning the town as the crown jewel of the Nayarit Riviera, the coastline of its home state. The naming also comes with the promise of federal money for upgrades, which residents say are needed. The town has grown to about 5,000 residents, plus the scores of visitors that cycle through.

Sewage and electricity services have had a hard time keeping up with the growth; ""aguas negras,"" or literally ""black waters,"" have spilled into the ocean.

""Any additional tourism development would worsen this disastrous health situation,"" said Indalecio Sanchez Rodriguez, an activist for the group Green Coast Alliance, which has criticized the area's growth.

The current main project is burying power lines under the town streets.

""It's bursting at the seams, the infrastructure,"" said Richard Brassard, an architect, who first visited Sayulita around 1970 after a friend read about it in a surfing book.

Sayulita's attractions are plentiful: surfing, charter fishing, seasonal whale-watching, lush-green jungle hikes and horseback riding, baby sea turtle releases, among others.

On the south end, its main beach still hosts small local fishing boats. Farther north, surfers ride waves as the town disappears into the jungle. Playa de los Muertos and Playa Carricitos provide quieter and more isolated alternatives within a few of miles. If it's not raining, take a walk to those beaches on the dirt roads lined by the dense forest.

Sayulita boasts chic restaurants to attract foodies and excellent street chow (Tacos El Ivan is top-notch and so is a cake stand named La Gorda, near the town square). Nightlife can be a dance party on the beach or the happy sounds of children playing at the central plaza.

Accommodations range from camping spots (El Camaron, located by the beach, is cheap, but reviews are mixed) to isolated luxury retreats (Teitiare, $400 a night).

We stayed at Playa Escondida, where accommodations range from bungalows ($200 a night during the high season) to penthouses perched on the hillside over a beach ($495 a night during high season). It was built on land Brassard used to own, and being an architect, he has designed the hotel's rooms and furniture. The hotel was used in a season of the ""Bachelor Paradise.""

The hotel was booked through the low season for the first time last year, Bassard said.

Back in Playa de los Muertos, the sun sets and the town cemetery behind the beach is lit up by candles placed on tombs as my girlfriend and I walk back to town.

Streets hum with activity. Motorbikes and cars buzz about while the sounds of live music, families, hawking vendors and even rowdy drunks fill the humid air. Many of the tourists transport themselves on golf carts.

""Now it's like Puerto Vallarta was back in the '60s. It's developed to that point,"" Bassard said.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"After South Carolina, can anybody take on Trump?",[],"Donald Trump on Sunday expressed measured optimism about winning the nomination, compared to his bravado after his overnight South Carolina victory, saying he could always be stopped.

The front-running Trump won 33 percent of the vote in the Republican South Carolina primary, roughly 11 percent ahead of challengers Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Ted Cruz, of Texas.

The win is Trumps second in the first three, early-state contests and now focuses the debate on whether any the four other remaining candidates can stop him, in part by taking the support for Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign after a disappointing fourth-place finish on Saturday in South Carolina.

I guess you can always be stopped, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I have very good competition. ... They are very talented people.

In his South Carolina victory speech, Trump said, Lets put this thing away.

To be sure, Trump appears to be in a good position. Every Republican presidential candidate who has won New Hampshire and South Carolina has taken the party nomination. And he appears to have strong support in the Deep South as the primary season swings into the region next month.

Trump notably held a rally this summer in Mobile, Ala. that attracted an estimated 30,000 people.

Rubio and Cruz remain confident they can eventually get more votes as the GOP field continues to narrow, then overtake Trump.

The eventual winner will face either Democrat Bernie Sanders or front-runner Hillary Clinton, who on Saturday night won her partys Nevada caucus over Sanders 53-to-47 percent.

She defeated Sanders in Iowa, but lost to him in New Hampshire.

Rubio told Fox News Sunday that he has a real sense of optimism after South Carolina. However, Rubio said he is not trying to get other candidates, specifically Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished fifth in South Carolina, to drop out, which could give Rubio even more of the so-called establishment vote now that Bush is out.

The sooner we coalesce, the better we can do as a party, he said. Its going to happen one way or another.

Cruz told ABCs This Week that Trump is a formidable candidate but polls show a majority of voters dont think he can beat Clinton.

You cannot come from him at the left, Cruz said of his primary strategy. You have to have a true conservative to win.

Clintons Nevada win came just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

foxnews,2015-08-07 00:00:00,Marcus Samuelsson on how his inspiration is a melting pot of flavors,['Ali Rosen'],"Celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson had a traditional road to the kitchen, training in Michelin-star-rated restaurants from France to Switzerland. But his influences  his homeland of Ethiopia, his childhood in Sweden, his adopted home of Harlem in New York City  were anything but typical, and they created the wide array of flavors that inspire his cuisine.

Adopted as a young boy by a Swedish family after his mother died of tuberculosis, the 45-year-old Samuelsson says he developed his love for food while watching his grandmother, Helga, make her famous roasted chicken, pan-fried herring and black bread.

He says his greatest influences are ""from just living  growing up, what me and family and my grandmother ate, but also when I started to travel.""

Hes had quite a vantage point. After training in Europe he was drawn to New York, and at 24 he became the youngest chef to receive a three-star review from the New York Times for his restaurant, Aquavit. He soon became a household name with stints on shows like ""Top Chef Masters"" (which he won), ""The Next Iron Chef,"" ""Chopped"" and later ABC's ""The Taste.""

In 2010 he moved to Harlem, where he opened Red Rooster and, more recently, Streetbird. He says his food has found its home in the diversity of his neighborhood.

""You think about Harlem,"" he says, and ""it's really a community that is based on post-migration and also immigration. So when I look at Streetbird and Red Rooster's menus, they are both reflections of migration and immigration. That's why we can have tacos and fried yardbird (a type of fried chicken seasoned with Ethiopian spices) on the menu.""

The success of those restaurants allowed him to dig deeper into his community by hosting an event called Harlem EatUp, a four-day festival that celebrates the neighborhood's food and culture and brings in chefs from all over the country. His 2012 memoir, Yes Chef, helped instill him as a household name, and now he's opening restaurants not just in the U.S., but also in Bermuda.

Hes got a lot on his plate, but Samuelsson says his love of food and his dedication to his adopted home will keep him moving forward.

""Keep dreaming,"" he says. ""You never know how your story is going to be told, and food is a way for me to communicate my passion for my community, but also my passion for food.""","['flavors', 'melting', 'samuelsson', 'marcus', 'food', 'pot', 'restaurants', 'training', 'community', 'chef', 'york', 'streetbird', 'harlem', 'red', 'inspiration']"
foxnews,2016-02-11 00:00:00,Monkey business: Gorilla's message about global warming was staged,['Maxim Lott'],"A recent video featuring a gorilla named Koko appearing to use sign language to warn man of the dangers of global warming was staged, and animal communication experts say there is no way a gorilla could comprehend the complexities of global warming.

The video, shown at Decembers Paris climate change conference, shows Koko use sign language to say things like I am gorilla, I am flowers, animals, I am nature... Man Koko love... but man... man stupid... Koko cry, time hurry, fix Earth...

The video was produced by a French environmental group and the gorilla Foundation, which cares for Koko the gorilla and notes on its website that the video was produced with a script and edited from a number of separate takes, for brevity and continuity.

Animal communication experts say the video is misleading.

This group has been really upping the ante for making incredible exaggerated claims for her comprehension, Barbara King, an anthropology professor at the College of William and Mary and the author of How Animals Grieve, told FoxNews.com.

King also worries that the ad, by exposing the idea of ape communication to ridicule, could undermine views about primates abilities.

Related: Scientist who urged government to sue climate skeptics gets millions from taxpayers

Koko is fabulous as she is. No one has to exaggerate. Scientists who do that -- it hurts our credibility. It really does.

Although primates like gorillas can learn hundreds of words, there is no good evidence that they can learn grammar, according to Arizona State University Psychology Professor Clive Wynne.

That includes even the simplest grammar like word order, for instance the difference between dog bites man and man bites dog.

Related: Climate change brings needed rain to Africa

On tests to distinguish terms like those, even one of the worlds smartest apes got the right answer 57 percent of the time  barely better than guessing. And that involved overly-generous grading by the trainers, Wynne notes.

But while primates havent been able to learn grammar, they can do impressive things once thought impossible.

Koko shows definite comprehension of spoken English, King said. Koko knows an impressive 2,000 words and uses them to make requests and respond to questions.

Related: NYU faculty senate recommends ending fossil fuel investments

Koko can also come up with some pretty creative ways of putting two phrases together, King noted. For example, Koko didnt know the word for ring and reportedly combined two words she knew  finger and bracelet  to make her meaning clear.

Primates also show human-like grief, King said.

There was one gorilla whose long-term mate and friend died in the zoo, and he first tried to revive her, even bringing her favorite food to her and putting it in her hand and poking her, she said.

And then at some point he seemed to come to a really stunning realization that his friend was not going to move. I dont know if thats a concept of death, but his behavior changed and he let out a very agonizing wail and stopped trying to revive her. Clearly something cognitive and emotional happened to him at that moment.

But animal experts agree that climate change is way beyond the understanding of gorillas.

A complex phenomenon like climate change is not understood by many humans, let alone an ape, Sally Boysen, an Ohio State University psychology professor, told FoxNews.com.

Even if Koko could understand climate change, experts disagree about the effect of climate change on primates. Warming has nearly paused over the last 17 years, and increases in the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere have increased plant growth.

However, Gorillas are threatened by other environmental harms, which have reduced the number of gorillas to just around 100,000. The main causes are slash-and-burn methods to clear African forests for agriculture, killings by hunters, and development in their habitats.

But while primates face serious environmental challenges and have impressive mental abilities compared to other animals, its still best not to get global warming advice from a gorilla.

Multiple witnesses have come forward to describe harrowing car trips Saturday night with Jason Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people and critically injuring two others during a six-hour shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Mich.

The witnesses' testimony indicates that Dalton was picking up fares in between carrying out the apparently random shootings. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Sunday that Dalton was a driver for the ride-sharing service, but did not say whether he was working Saturday night.

MLive reported that a Facebook post from a woman named Mackenzie Waite described an Uber driver named Jason as ""not a safe ride"". Waite, who said in the post that her fiance had booked a ride with Dalton, claimed that Dalton sideswiped a car while running a stop sign and then drove 80 miles per hour down a local street ""swerving in and out of oncoming traffic"".

Waite's post was timestampted at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, about 30 minutes before the first shooting took place. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting confirmed to MLive that law enforcement knew about the post.","['uber', 'kalamazoo', 'named', 'shooter', 'michigan', 'youre', 'driver', 'witnesses', 'waite', 'accused', 'gunman', 'dalton', 'post', 'shooting', 'rides', 'ride']"

He fought on short notice, was dauntless with the challenge he was taking on -- a jump up to welterweight -- and was dangerous on many levels once the fight started.

The American is known as a great kickboxer, and he is. But he has solid wrestling and nasty submissions, especially off of his back, that often go unmentioned, even though he has used them in most of his biggest wins. He may have been reckless in taking a fight so soon after getting knocked out less than two months ago, but Cerrone showed his smarts by adapting to the situation in the fight and taking every hole he could find, in Pittsburgh.

Cerrone got tagged a few times by Alex Oliveira, and then, when the Brazilian squared up a bit too much and opened himself up to takedowns, Cerrone recognized and capitalized.

Instead of getting into a slugfest, where anyone could come out of the chaos a winner, Cerrone shot early, and shot often, to put himself where he had a huge advantage -- on the ground.

Eventually, he got a takedown, and from there, he dominated. A few moments later, Cerrone scored the 10th finish win of his UFC career.

Cerrone passed the half-guard, took the mount, then gave up position to lock in a triangle choke when Oliveira turned to his side and left an arm hanging. The Jackson/Wink fighter then rolled to his own back, didn't even need to move Oliveira's left arm across his neck to finish, and forced a tap-out submission so quickly that he had to point it out to the referee watching nearby.

Cerrone didn't choose to stand and bang, mindlessly for the fans. He fought smart, and fighting smart is always fighting best.

And, he fought for himself, which is also always a good idea. ""For once,"" he said, afterwards, ""this fight was for me.""

The win is his ninth in his last 10 fights and is probably dramatic enough to let the star pick up speed again, now in two divisions. ""I get to do [155] and 70 now,"" he continued, beaming.

""If you want to get hurt, I know a guy.""

Cerrone puts himself through the ringer and through a lot of pain to fight as often as he does (four times, each year, for example, in 2013, 2014, and 2015). By letting loose with all of his skills, not just his stand-up striking ones, he gives himself a chance to at least save his body a bit once he gets in the cage.","['cerrone', 'smarts', 'showed', 'cowboy', 'win', 'taking', 'guts', 'fight', 'oliveira', 'fought', 'left', 'known', 'shot', 'main', 'event', 'smart', 'times']"

foxnews,2015-12-21 00:00:00,Ancient marine reptiles flew through the water,[],"The ancient, four-flippered plesiosaur didn't swim like a fish, whale or even an otter  but instead like a penguin, a new study finds.

Plesiosaurs, giant marine reptiles that lived during the dinosaur age, likely propelled themselves forward underwater by flapping their two front flippers, much like penguins do today, the researchers said. The paleo-giants probably didn't rely much on their back flippers for propulsion, as that movement would've only marginally increased their speed, computer simulations showed.

""This is the first time plesiosaur locomotion has been simulated with computers, so our study provides exciting new information on how these unusual extinct animals may have swum,"" said study co-author Adam Smith, a curator of natural sciences at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham Natural History Museum in the United Kingdom. [Photos: Uncovering One of the Largest Plesiosaurs on Record]

The study began when Jie Tan, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, began creating computer models and simulations that captured the movements of modern animals. After designing virtual simulations of moving frogs, turtles, eels and manta rays, Tan turned to imaginary creatures. But he wanted another challenge, so he chose an extinct beast for his next project, said study senior author Greg Turk, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech.

Plesiosaur locomotion has puzzled scientists since the reptiles were first discovered in 1824, because there aren't any modern animals that look like them. Even marine turtles, which have two large front flippers, are no match, because unlike plesiosaurs, turtles have tiny back flippers.""I did some poking around and found that plesiosaurs have this weird body plan,"" Turk said. ""There isn't any agreement in the paleontology literature about how they swam.""

To investigate, the team of computer scientists and paleontologists built a computer model based on Meyerasaurus victor, an 11-foot-long (3.4 meters) plesiosaur discovered in a Lower Jurassic formation in Germany. The scientists placed pivot points on the model's legs wherever the real-life M. victor had joints, but they kept the model's neck and tail rigid, Turk said.

""We weren't looking for what contribution the tail motion had,"" Turk told Live Science. ""There are hints that some plesiosaurs might have had a little bit of a tail fin, but that's not something we looked into.""

The researchers ran about 2,000 simulations to identify the most efficient way the plesiosaur could have swum. In the end, they found that if plesiosaurs flapped their front flippers up and down, the animals could have efficiently propelled themselves forward with every up and down stroke.

""Plesiosaurs flew underwater using their winglike flippers,"" Smith said. ""The front flippers were the powerhouse providing most of the thrust, while the rear flippers provided less thrust and may have been used for stability and steering instead.""

This technique, if accurate, clearly worked for plesiosaurs; the reptiles reigned as marine apex predators for 135 million years, until the asteroid event wiped them out some 66 million years ago, the researchers said.

The study was published online Dec. 17 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"CDC, Brazil start big study to test Zika link to birth defects",[],"U.S. and Brazilian researchers are heading to Joao Pessoa in the state of Paraiba on Monday to recruit mothers and babies in one of the biggest government-led studies to understand whether the Zika virus is linked to microcephaly, a rare birth defect.

Brazil has confirmed more than 500 cases of microcephaly, defined by an unusually small head, since the start of the outbreak. Over 3,900 additional suspected cases are being investigated.

Brazil normally only sees about 150 cases a year. The spike in microcephaly prompted the World Health Organization on Feb. 1 to declare Zika an international health emergency.

The study has been in the planning stages for several weeks. It will pair researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with Brazilian experts to examine babies already born with microcephaly and their mothers to determine whether Zika or some other infection caused their malady.

""What we're trying to do is to better define the association between children that have been diagnosed with microcephaly and whether or not they might have evidence of congenital Zika virus infection,"" said Dr. Erin Staples, a CDC medical epidemiologist leading the study in Paraiba.

In an interview, Staples offered a first glimpse at the long-anticipated study. Researchers hope to enroll 100 mothers and their babies with microcephaly. These will be matched with 300 to 400 pairs of healthy mothers and their babies. Initial results are expected this spring, a senior CDC official said.

Blood samples from moms and babies in both groups will be tested for signs of Zika infection.

Current diagnostic tests looking for Zika antibodies are limited because they closely resemble dengue, a related virus common in Brazil. The team hopes that taking samples from both mothers and their babies will give a more precise picture of whether Zika was involved. They will also look for other exposures that might explain why a baby developed microcephaly.

The study's design should help determine the relative risk of microcephaly in babies whose mothers were infected with Zika.

Staples said the work could provide stronger confirmation of a link, but that it would take years of scientific investigation to prove whether Zika actually causes microcephaly.

In the meantime, evidence of a connection is mounting. Researchers have found the virus in fetal brain tissue, amniotic fluid and placenta. An autopsy of an aborted fetus showed the full genetic code of the virus in the brain and evidence that the virus was replicating.

Brazil is the only country to report a spike in microcephaly after Zika arrived last year. The CDC has a vested interest in unraveling the mystery as the outbreak makes its way north. The mosquito-borne virus is circulating in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and is expected to reach several southern U.S. states with warmer weather in the spring.

CDC experts will join staff from the Brazil's Health Ministry. The team will also try to determine the most common characteristics of microcephaly that might be specifically associated with Zika, and check whether other abnormalities might result from exposure to the virus.

Staples estimates it will take four to five weeks to get the study fully enrolled, but it may take longer.

""We need to make sure we have the right number of cases and controls to be able to say with a good degree of certainty what is going on,"" she said.

foxnews,2015-12-07 00:00:00,"In an increasingly dangerous world, Obama has checked out as commander in chief",['Sen Scott Brown'],"Ben Franklin said that death and taxes were the two certainties of life. A third certainty in our country used to be strong leadership from the individual in the Oval Office. Abraham Lincoln, F.D.R, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and many others have used their position as our commander in chief to exude Americas strength on the world stage and promote our nations unique exceptionalism.

However, on several recent big issues, President Obama has not taken the challenging, but necessary step up to the plate to demonstrate why America needs to lead in the world. His actions instead seem to suggest that we can lead from behind, which goes against everything that our country has stood for in the past.

The best example of this is President Obamas utter failure to address the danger that ISIS presents to the United States. Their sickening attacks in Paris are still fresh in our mind, but it is important to note that just hours before the terrorists attacked the city, President Obama said that ISIS was contained and on the run.

Following the attacks, instead of stepping forward and adopting an aggressive strategy to take the fight to ISIS, the president deferred and continued to give off the impression that our current strategy to combat radical Islamic terrorism is working. His response showed that he is either delusional to the real threat ISIS presents our nation or he is simply incapable of providing authentic leadership for the sake of the country and the globe.

For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

Then last week, following the devastating tragedy in San Bernardino, President Obama immediately leapt to blame gun laws and Republicans, when in fact the attacks appear to have been perpetrated by ISIS sympathizers. The fact that the President would try to score political points instead of committing to once-and-for-all going after Americas greatest threat is emblematic of his entire presidency, putting politics and party before country and leadership.

While it seems President Obama has already checked out on his White House responsibilities and is looking forward to writing his memoirs and building his library, the absence of American leadership has now become a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election.

On one side, there are Republican candidates who all know and understand that America must operate from a position of strength, and adhere to the ideas espoused by Ronald Reagan about leadership and action. They will all say what needs to be said, do what needs to be done, and lead when the world needs to be led.

On the other side, there is Hillary Clinton, President Obamas former Secretary of State and the architect of his disastrous foreign policy agenda who also jumped at the chance last week to put political points on the board, instead of promoting a strong strategy to defeat ISIS. Secretary Clintons lack of understanding about ISIS was crystal clear at the most recent Democratic debate, when she said that the fight against ISIS cannot be an American fight.

Secretary Clinton, it must be an American fight. For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

For the past seven years, we have seen what it looks like when America doesnt take charge, but instead sits in the backseat as a global observer. As a result, our country is less safe, less secure, and people have a rational fear of another heinous act of terrorism coming to our shores.

Instead of electing someone such as Hillary Clinton, who outlined President Obamas global agenda and agrees with his worldview, we need to elect a president that understands the importance of American leadership, and will reassert our nation as the leading force for good in the world.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The surprising new reason why eating fried foods may be good for you,[],"Attention, French fry addicts: Your favorite food may not be so terrible for you after all.

At least, that's the conclusion made by a recent study published in Food Chemistry that found that the antioxidant content of deep-fried potatoes, pumpkin, tomatoes, and eggplant was significantly higher than sauteed or boiled veggies.

It's no secret among nutritionists that adding a fat source to vegetablese.g., roasting them with olive oil or using full-fat salad dressing over the fat-free stuffboosts absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. So it's not totally illogical that deep-frying could take things a step further: When vegetables are fried in a healthy oil (think extra virgin olive oil), antioxidant compounds called phenols in the oil are transferred to veggies, said Frances Largeman-Roth, RD, author of Eating in Color, who was not involved in the study. In other words, a hot oil bath doesn't just unlock nutrients already inside vegetablesit actually helps infuse them with more nutrients than they started with.

MORE: The Super Common Oil That Science Now Shows Is Worse Than Sugar

As for other greasy goodies like fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, and cheese curds, researchers don't know whether these foods soak up any phenols at all when fried. Largeman-Roth speculates that these foods have lower water content than vegetables, which doesn't allow them to soak up as much oil (and, consequently, phenols), if any at all.

These findings, while exciting, don't give you a carte blanche to go crazy on those fried zucchini chips whenever you feel like it, though. All that oiland batter if veggies are coated before fried, which most aremeans major calories, which could spell a fast-track to weight gain, overconsumption, and other health problems.

Also, researchers fried veggies in extra virgin olive oil, which is known for its sky-high levels of phenols. Frying in regular olive oil or refined vegetable oils prolific used by most restaurants might not have had the same effect, Largeman-Roth said. Even worse, some restaurant frying oils contain trans fat. (Here are 14 cooking oils and which is the healthiest for you.)

Oil temperature is also an issue. While frying in EVOO can imbue your veggies with more antioxidants, those benefits backfire if the oil gets too hot.

""If you heat any oil past its smoke point, it starts to break down and release free radicals,"" Largman-Roth said.

The study used a fry temperature of around 350 degrees, which is safely below extra virgin olive oil's 400 degree smoke point. (Try this healthy gluten-free 'fried' chicken.)

Of course, you can't control the type of oil or temperature used in a restaurant fryer, but you can at home. What to do? If you want to eat fried food as an occasional indulgence, stick to vegetables that you fry at home in high-quality oil, using a fry thermometer to make sure the oil doesn't go above its smoke point.

The poster is part of a Black History Month exhibit at the Central Islip courthouse on Long Island. But three retired NYPD officers told CBS2 New York last week that the drawing doesnt belong in a courthouse. One referred to it as hate speech.

Black Lives Matter we feel is anti-police and the rhetoric that they spew is anti-police and weve actually had them on video walking the streets of New York City calling for the death of police officers, retired NYPD officer and Internet radio host Ed Munoz told the station. So for it to be hanging in a courtroom, we find outrageous.

The drawing reads: Stop The Violence. Black Lives Matter. Stop the Racism.

The verdict on the poster with courthouse visitors was split, the station reported.

I think its highly political and controversial, one said.

Another said, I dont think its anti-cop, its just awareness of whats going on in society today.

State judge C. Randall Hinrichs, who oversees the courts in Suffolk County, told CBS2 there are no plans to remove the poster.

It is not the intention of the court to put forth any anti-law enforcement message, he told the station. This is the cultural response of a middle school student, here in Central Islip, to present-day America.

Hinrichs said the last thing they want to do is offend law enforcement.

It talks about stopping violence and racism, which are admirable sentiments, and I know its interpreted by different people, different ways, he said.","['retired', 'courthouse', 'ignites', 'students', 'poster', 'violence', 'controversy', 'matter', 'station', 'lives', 'york', 'black', 'told']"

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Online insomnia therapy may help ease depression symptoms,[],"Online therapy for insomnia may help people who also have depression manage symptoms of the mood disorder, an Australian study suggests.

Researchers randomly assigned 1,149 participants to use either an online cognitive behavioral therapy program for insomnia or to follow an interactive health program that wasn't designed to treat the sleep disorder.

With online therapy, people reported significantly lower depression symptoms at the end of the six-week program and after six months of follow up than their peers in the control group who didn't get online therapy, the study found.

""Most people undertaking the program found benefits to their mental health,"" said lead study author Helen Christensen, director and chief scientist at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales in Australia, in email to Reuters Health.

The program, called SHUTi, is available online. The cost starts at $135 for 16 weeks, which includes six online 45 minute sessions and another 10 weeks of access to self-help and review materials. The program is fully automated, with no human support.

While cognitive behavior therapy and treatments that address insomnia have both been effective against depression in previous research, the current study focuses on whether web-based interventions to improve sleep might also lead to a better mood, researchers note in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, online January 27.

For the Internet experiment, Christensen and colleagues excluded people who might not be able to get regular sleep every night like pregnant women and shift workers. They also left out people without reliable web access, and individuals diagnosed with psychosis, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Roughly half of the participants completed the six-week online programs, with significantly more dropouts from the cognitive behavior therapy group than the control group.

People in both groups had reductions in depression symptoms at six weeks and at six months, the study found. But with online therapy, average depression scores dropped enough for participants to be considered depression free, while the other group had average scores that indicated they still had mild depression.

At six weeks, 71 percent of the people who got online therapy had no depression, compared with 42 percent of participants in the control group.

By six months, 73 percent of individuals who had online therapy had no depression, compared with 52 percent of people in the other group.

There were no differences between groups in the proportion of people who developed major depression during the study period.

At six weeks, 8 percent of people with therapy had moderately severe depression, compared with 6 percent in the control group. At six months, 3 percent of people who had therapy had this level of depression, compared with 4 percent for the others.

In addition to the large numbers of participants who didn't finish the study, other limitations include the lack of data on previous depression diagnoses, which might mean some participants had first-time depression and others were seeking treatment for ongoing mental health difficulties, the authors note.

Few participants were taking medication for depression, which also might influence how symptoms changed over time, the researchers point out.

Even so, the findings suggest that online therapy might provide a good treatment option for some people who need help managing depression, Ricardo Munoz, director of the Institute for International Internet Interventions for Health at Palo Alto University in California, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.

""What we can say about its being delivered online is that more people were able to benefit from it, because they were not forced to come to a clinic to receive the intervention,"" Munoz said by email. ""This is one of the great innovations and advantages of Internet interventions.""

The study was funded by The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Two of the study's 10 authors have financial relationships with BeHealth Solutions, the company that sells SHUTi.","['help', 'ease', 'months', 'insomnia', 'symptoms', 'participants', 'program', 'therapy', 'online', 'health', 'weeks', 'study', 'depression']"
foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Apollo 10 astronauts reported hearing odd 'music' on far side of moon,[],"The astronauts who flew the dress rehearsal for the first lunar landing reported hearing mysterious outer space-type music while flying behind the moon in May 1969.

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","['sound', 'noise', 'far', 'flew', 'young', 'astronauts', 'hearing', 'reported', 'nasa', 'music', 'module', 'apollo', 'odd', 'moon', 'stafford']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Giant dinosaur had 2 tumors on its tailbone,[],"It's fairly common to discover dinosaur remains scratched with ancient claw or bite marks, but finding fossils with signs of tumors is rare.

And now scientists have found not one but two different types of tumor on the same bone  the vertebra of a titanosaur, a gigantic long-necked, long-tailed paleo beast, a new study finds.

""Finding any disease in fossils is rare,"" said the study's lead researcher, Fernando Barbosa, a doctoral student of geology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. ""Cancer still is most rare because the majority of them do not leave signals in bones."" [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]

The finding is the first known case of a tumor in a dinosaur that isn't a duck-billed dinosaur, or hadrosaur, the researchers said.

The 7-inch-long fossilized vertebra, discovered in 2012 in Brazil's southern Sao Paulo state, belongs to a species in the Titanosauridae family, ""the most abundant Cretaceous dinosaur family of South America,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

However, the 90-million-year-old bone had an unusual appearance  a ""small bony button-shaped protuberance,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Curious, Barbosa and his colleagues decided to investigate the weird bump, which measured just 0.3 by 0.3 inches.

They found evidence of two tumors, both benign, Barbosa said. One is an osteoma, a bone overgrowth, which the researchers confirmed with a computer tomography (CT) scan and an examination of the fossil's structure.

The other, a hemangioma, is a harmless vascular tumor.

""We were very lucky finding this because we didn't have any evidence of the hemangioma,"" Barbosa told Live Science in an email. ""It was diagnosed by [the CT scan], which was only possible because we were investigating the radiological appearance of the osteoma.""

The tumors, though examples of abnormal cell growth, should not be called cancer, he said. Usually, only harmful tumors are called cancer, and these tumors were benign, Barbosa said. Furthermore, because of the tumors' location and likely small sizes, the dinosaur probably didn't notice them, the researchers said.

It's not the first ancient animal to have an osteoma, the researchers said. The oldest known case of osteoma dates to the early Carboniferous (a period spanning 359.2 million to 299 million years ago) in the North American fish Phanerosteon mirabile. The mosasaur Platecarpus, a marine reptile, also had an osteoma, as did a crocodile, Leidyosuchus formidabilis, which lived during the Paleocene, a period spanning between 65 million and 56 million years ago.

The new finding shows that dinosaurs other than hadrosaurs developed tumors, Barbosa said. For instance, Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, Bactrosaurus and Edmontosaurus, all duck-billed dinosaurs, show evidence of hemangiomas, just like the titanosaur does. Various individuals from the genus Edmontosaurus also showed evidence of a desmoplastic fibroma (a rare bone tumor), an osteoblastoma (bone cancer) and a metastatic cancer (cancer that spreads throughout the body).

""We still need to find several other diseases in dinosaurs [and] other extinct animals, and understand why they were affected by them,"" Barbosa said.

The study will be published in the July issue of the journal Cretaceous Research.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,USWNT outmuscle Canada in Olympic Qualifier final,[],"So much for a bloodbath. Or bragging rights. In the end, the U.S. walked away with a 2-0 win over Canada at the CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Championship final.

The match was more noteworthy for continued amazing story of teenager Mallory Pugh's emergence and the solidification of U.S. women's national team roster that is light-years leaner and faster than the squad that won the 2015 Women's World Cup.

With both the U.S. and Canada having already booked their tickets to the 2016 Rio Olympics with semifinal victories, their meeting in the CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Championship final did not produce the fireworks that might have been expected. Canada veterans Christine Sinclair, Diane Matheson, Sophie Schmidt and goalkeeper Erin McLeod did not start, and the U.S. needed an entire half to get untracked before finally breaking through.

Lindsey Horan put the U.S. on the board in the 53rd minute. The 21-year-old center midfielder headed a 40-yard pass from center back Becky Sauerbrunn to open the scoring in dramatic fashion. It was Horan's second goal for the U.S. national team. It was also a very fitting connection, given that Sauerbrunn's assist came in what was her 100th career cap.

The 30-year-old St. Louis native and U.S. co-captain (along with Carli Lloyd) has been a stalwart for the U.S. defense, and has never scored a goal and had only two previous career assists. The St. Louis native joked earlier this week that it took her about three years to get her first three national team caps, but since being installed as center back, Sauerbrunn has been a study in nearly flawless perfectionism.

The U.S. went up 2-0 in the 61st minute. Pugh, who has creatively dominated the left side in all six matches she has played so far for the U.S., added her third assist when she dribbled the ball deep into left side of Canada's penalty box before deftly passing all the way across to Tobin Heath. There were other U.S. attackers coming up for the play, but Pugh seemed to see that Heath, as almost a trailer, had the best angle.

For the second consecutive game, U.S. coach Jill Ellis used the same line-up. It was notable for two reasons. Kelley O'Hara has now started twice ahead of Ali Krieger. It wasn't clear if Krieger is battling an injury, but O'Hara has looked like a very good fit, given the pace at which this team is playing. And Ellis wants more speed and pace from the U.S. side going forward, since that's where the international game is now.

But more significant is the rocket emergence of Pugh. The 16-year-old high school senior got her second consecutive start ahead of Crystal Dunn, which is interesting in that Dunn scored a record-tying five goals against Puerto Rico in the final match of group play. Ellis is clearly eager to give Pugh as much experience in high-caliber matches as possible.

However, given Pugh's speed and technical ability and comfort, this is starting to become more than just an experience-enhancer. It's starting to look as if Pugh gives the U.S. incredible spark at the wide midfield position. She's really unlike any other player that's come out of the pipeline for U.S. Soccer. Ellis has been tracking Pugh for years and at the rate at which the Colorado teen's going, she could be looking at a roster spot for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Heck, the kid actually made so many moves and burned so much grass that she wound up breaking her shoe. In the 85th minute, Pugh tried to collect a pass down the sideline from O'Hara, but she kept tripping and falling, leaving O'Hara to just start laughing. It turned out Pugh's cleat sole was flapping loose, and she had to run over and get it taped.

Mallory Pugh so good she breaks her shoes. #USWNT pic.twitter.com/yksC71SpOh  laura vecsey (@lauravecsey) February 21, 2016

As for the Canada vs. U.S. rivalry, it turns out the pre-match jabbering was much ado not nothing. Hope Solo was prepared for a bloodbath, but the match dynamics were more lamb than lion. Not that there wasn't some pushing and shoving along the way.

In the 14th minute, Melissa Tancredi tracked Julie Johnston back into the U.S. penalty box following a long pass. As the two went for the ball, Tancredi tangled Johnston's feet and the U.S. center back went down hard and hit her head. It looked worse than it was and Johnston was back up and on duty without delay.

The referee decided to make sure things didn't get out of hand. In the 19th minute, Josee Belanger was given a yellow card for her from-behind hit on Lindsey Horan, which dropped the U.S. midfielder to the ground.

Other than the hard tackles, the opening minutes featured some pretty wide-open play for both sides. U.S. goalkeeper was not tested with shots early, however she did face some aggressive runs from Canadian forwards Nichelle Prince and Tancredi.

Next up for the the USWNT is the newly-formed four-team She Believes tournament. The U.S. will face off against Germany, France and England from March 3-9.","['outmuscle', 'canada', 'olympic', 'ellis', 'qualifier', 'ohara', 'given', 'start', 'uswnt', 'team', 'pugh', 'went', 'final', 'minute', 'center']"

Because Noreen's markers have increased, with the gallbladder and the ribs happening at the same time, her doctors have decided to stop the chemo (this is the drug which Noreen and her Foundation have backed financially, and for which she has made four trips to Washington DC lobbying the FDA which ended a ""WIN"" with the drug being fast-tracked by the FDA for use by patients with advanced metastatic disease).



Noreen is disappointed in the turn of events and we are waiting for the doctors to come up with a new strategy. She hates to be confined to bed. Nurse Ratched is tough, and I am getting her to walk a little each day.

foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,Tourism in the Caribbean jumped 7% in 2015 but Zika likely to kill the growth,[],"As the Caribbean Tourism Organization celebrated Tuesday a 2015 report showing a glowing surge in tourism, the mosquito-borne Zika virus looms large on the horizon.

The report shows 2015 surpassed the global growth rate as it set new arrival and spending records, though there are grave concerns that the virus could put a dent in those numbers in 2016.

Nearly 29 million people visited the region last year, a 7 percent jump that surpassed the 4 percent global tourism growth rate, said Hugh Riley, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization. Visitors to the Caribbean spent $30 billion last year, a $1 billion increase from 2014, he said.

""It's important for us to celebrate our victories in the Caribbean. We have our challenges,"" Riley said in a phone interview.

He credited a stronger U.S. economy, new flights, lower oil prices and persistent marketing.

U.S. travelers accounted for 14.3 million visits, representing roughly 50 percent of all arrivals. Barbados, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago reported the highest growth rates in U.S. arrivals. Meanwhile, there were more than 5 million arrivals from Europe for the first time in seven years, more than 1 million from Britain alone.

Hotel occupancies and average daily rates also increased last year for most hotels, although one-third of hotels reported a net loss as they struggled with high operating and air travel costs, said Frank Comito, CEO of the Florida-based Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association.

""While most destinations have done well and most hotels did well, that's not been the case across the board,"" he said. ""There have been some areas of slow growth and even no growth.""

The news comes as the Caribbean and Latin America struggle with an increase in Zika cases, with Puerto Rico already reporting several wedding and business conference cancellations. The U.S. territory has more than 30 confirmed Zika cases. The virus has hit Martinique and French Guiana the hardest, with more than 2,500 potential cases and more than 100 confirmed ones.

Comito said there have been some cancellations of trips to the Caribbean but declined to provide a specific number.

But officials said they expect tourist arrivals to increase roughly 5 percent this year.

worlds biggest ocean-dwelling crocodile buried on the edge of the Sahara, a creature that was twice the size of anything seen today.

Named Machimosaurus rex, this croc would have weighed in at

least 6,600 pounds and been around 32 feet long. Other than its size, it would have looked much like a modern day crocodile except for its narrow snout  which was designed to allow it swim in the ocean.

It would have been the top predator in what was then an

ocean that separated Africa from Europe about 130 million years ago.

This is an incredibly big crocodile. It is twice as big as

a present day marine crocodile, University of Bolognas Federico Fanti, who was part of the team that made the discovery with support from the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration, told FoxNews.com.

The skull itself is as big I am, said Fanti, whose

discovery was detailed in a study in the journal Cretaceous Research. Just the skull is more than five feet long.

Its a massive crocodile.

Tunisia, where the skeleton and some bones were found, would have been a

lagoon facing the ocean and the environment would have been filled with huge fish and turtles  all favorite prey of the Machimosaurus rex.

This animal, however, used to feast on the large turtles or

big fishes that it found in the ocean, Fanti said. He was so big and so powerful that it was absolutely at the top of the food chain.

Beyond its size, Fanti said the significance of the find is

what it tells us about a mass extinction event that is believed to have happened between the Jurassic and Cretaceous period about 150 million years ago. Machimosaurus

rex was thought to have died out then but the discovery suggests the extinction event was not as widespread as some paleontologist thought.

Related: 20-Foot Fanged, Galloping Ancient Croc Fossils Found

The fact that Machimosaurus rex (pertaining to a group that

was well alive in the Jurassic) lived 130-120 million years ago indicate that there was no mass extinction, Fanti said.

Everyone thought this group of crocodiles went extinct in

the Jurassic but we found it well into the Cretaceous, he said. We simply extended the temporal range of the animals. Twenty million years is a lot of time.

Fanti, whose team has discovered 20 new species including a rebbachisaurid sauropod Tataouinea hannibalis in the same area, said there is less to learn about crocodile evolution from this new discovery. The reason, he said, is that crocodiles have changed little over time.

Basically, they are bigger or smaller, he said of their

evolution, adding that even bigger crocodiles lived on land, many of which also have gone extinct. The largest freshwater crocodile, Sarcosuchus imperator, lived 110 million years ago and grew as long as 40 feet (12 meters). It weighed

up to 17,500 pounds, according to National Geographic.","['rex', 'lived', 'jurassic', 'big', 'million', 'species', 'machimosaurus', 'crocodile', 'edge', 'sahara', 'massive', 'fossil', 'size', 'desert', 'fanti']"

The video was released Thursday afternoon.

Christopher Marquez, 30, an Iraq War vet, told the Washington Post he was eating in a back corner of the restaurant when a group of teens and young men approached his table.

""I'm telling this to everybody because it's been happening a lot around here and across our country,"" Marquez told ""Fox & Friends."" ""It was a hate crime. They targeted me because of my skin color. So, we're seeing a lot of these events of people being attacked because they're white. And I'm thinking we have to speak up more about this because it's just going to continue to happen.""

Marquez said he left the McDonald's, but was knocked unconscious by a blow to his head. When he came to, his pants were ripped and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards and VA medical card among other items, was missing.

According to the Daily Caller, which first reported the incident, Marquez was able to take a cab back to his apartment, where building employees called police. He was treated at George Washington University Hospital for head trauma.

Marquez served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011. He was awarded the Bronze Star with combat distinguishing device for valor during the battle for Fallujah, Iraq, in November 2004. Marquez is one of two Marines depicted carrying then-1st Sgt. Bradley Kasal out of the so-called ""Hell House"" in a famous photograph.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"In an actual race, which presidential candidate would win?",[],"Bernie Sanders has not made it a secret that he was once a competitive distance runner, but as the presidential race heats up, that fact has been getting increasing attention.

At a recent Democratic Presidential Town Hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders, 74, said this on CNN when asked about his athletic accomplishments: I was a very good long-distance runner, I would say not a great runner, but I was captain of my track team, won a number of cross-country meets, and certainly won a whole lot of races. Good, very good, not great.

Sanderss assertions have led reporters to do some digging into his past. Their research has revealed that Sanders was indeed a strong runner for James Madison High School in Brooklyn. He was good enough that his name occasionally appeared in The New York Times.

In May, Sanders told CNBC that he believes his best mile time is 4:37. Sanders has repeated that assertion elsewhere, but no one has yet been able to uncover printed proof of his time. But as runners know, not all of ones best times wind up being printed in a newspaper.

According to The New York Times, Sanders did finish third in mile at the Brooklyn Public Schools Athletic League Track & Field Championships on May 21, 1957, when he was 15 years old. The winning time in that race was 4:37, but only the winning times were printed in the newspaper.

Little is known about Sanderss current fitness regimen, and his campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his running exploits, past or present. But in November, a video posted on YouTube of Sanders running to catch a train, showed that while he may no longer be a fast miler, hes still pretty light on his feet.

Related: Lose the pounds, feel great and run faster!

All of the attention on Sanderss running exploits begs the question: Do any of the other candidates run?

Republican Mike Huckabee, 60, who ended his presidential campaign last week, was the most accomplished marathoner in the presidential race. Huckabee famously lost more than 100 pounds, took up running, and was featured in a 2005 Runners World article. He ran four marathons between 2005 and 2006, with a best of 4:26:05 at the 2006 Little Rock Marathon. The last time Huckabee made national headlines for his running was when he announced plans to run the 2008 Boston Marathon, before pulling out with a knee injury.

Huckabee had surgery to remove a bone chip from his knee November 25, 2015, and Huckabees campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his running or current exercise routine.

Republican Marco Rubio, 44, a former college football player, claims that he is the fastest presidential candidate running in 2016. That could very well be true, over short distances at least. He has maintained over the years that he ran 4.65 for the 40-yard dash at his fastest, which would put him on par with some NFL running backs.

As with Sanderss mile, there is no YouTube video to prove it, but Rubio clearly has an athletic background. He attended Tarkio College in Missouri on a football scholarship for one year, and he reportedly works out on a regular basis. Rubios campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Republican Rand Pauls campaign confirmed in an email to Runners World that his exercise routine includes some running.

Senator Rand Paul exercises every day, and running is certainly part of his routine, Paul's communications director, Sergio Gor, wrote without elaborating further, before Paul ended his campaign last week.

In April, Paul, 53, tweeted a mid-run selfie that further supported his running background. He even had safety runner shirts for men and women so supporters could safely promote their candidate while running around town.

If the other candidates do any running, its not something that theyve broadcast widely. And none of the other campaigns responded to requests for comment about their candidates exercise routine.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,8 stunning natural bridges around the world,['Lyn Mettler'],"Thousands or even millions of years old, natural bridges are awe-inspiring sights that draw thousands of visitors every year.

Also called natural arches, they are essentially holes in rock, and they are among Mother Natures greatest creations: sandstone or limestone formations that are the result of erosion or the collapse of cavern roofs.

While you can travel around the world to see some amazing natural bridges, some may even be in your backyard.

Here are some of the most majestic natural bridges across the globe:

1.&nbspNatural Bridges National Monument, Utah Natural Bridges National Monument Youll find not just one natural bridge, but three, at the Natural Bridges National Monument, and they date as far back as 5,000 years. Named ""Kachina,"" ""Owachomo"" and ""Sipapu"" in honor of the Native Americans who once lived there, these bridges in the desert of the Colorado Plateau were declared a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. The bridges were formed over millions of years by erosion from running water on the sedimentary rock, which 260 million years ago was the site of a beach. When originally formed, each bridge was thick and massive, like Kachina Bridge, but as they erode, they become more delicate, like Owachomo, and eventually collapse. So you may want to see it now, before its gone!

2.&nbspGreen Bridge of Wales, Great Britain  Crown copyright (2014) Visit Wales One of the most recognized landmarks in Wales, the Green Bridge sits on the Pembrokeshire Coast near Castlemartin. A limestone arch formed by erosion from seawater and waves, the bridge was once a solid piece of rock. Two caves likely formed on either side, eventually wearing away and creating a hole through the rock. This arch, too, will eventually collapse due to erosion. You view the arch from above via a coastal path or take a guided kayak tour and paddle through it. Wales also has another arch, the Church Doors Sea Arch at Shrinkle Haven, though its not as impressive as the Green Bridge.

3.&nbspPravcicka Brana, Czech Republic Czech Tourism The Czech Republic is home to the biggest natural rock arch in all of Europe: the Pravcicka brana, or Pravcice Sandstone Gate, in Bohemian Switzerland National Park. While you cant walk on top of it due to its narrowing and thinness, you can stand underneath to get a sense of its grandeur. Standing almost seven stories tall, the bridge, which is made of sandstone that has been carved over millennia, is best viewed from several nearby vantage points accessible by hiking trails. This impressive formation inspired Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote part of The Snow Queen there, and it was featured in The Chronicles of Narnia movies.

4.&nbspNatural Bridge, Virginia Virginia Tourism Corporation Known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the Modern World, Virginias Natural Bridge has a storied history. Worshipped by the Monacan Indians, who called it the bridge of God, surveyed by George Washington (whose initials are said to be carved into the wall) and later purchased by Thomas Jefferson, this imposing bridge once served as a mountain retreat and has been painted and drawn by artists the world over. Located just off the Blue Ridge Parkway, this National Historic Landmark was formed when a cavern collapsed, leaving the rock span towering above a creek below. Other nearby attractions include the Caverns at Natural Bridge, which reach 34 stories below ground, and the Monacan Indian Living History Village.

5.&nbspNatural Bridge, Kentucky KentuckyTourism.com Kentuckys Natural Bridge is a sandstone arch that stands 6 1/2 stories high and may be a million years old. Situated in the Eastern Kentucky mountains and one of four Kentucky state parks, Natural Bridge was formed when large blocks of sandstone fell off each side of a narrow ridge, followed by weathering and impacts from the root systems of plants. Surrounded by the Daniel Boone National Forest, visitors can hike more than 18 miles of trails leading to the bridge and enjoy fishing, paddling or canoeing the 40-acre Mill Creek Lake. The area also has other natural archways, but none as spectacular as Natural Bridge.

6.&nbspPont dArc, France Copyright Atout France-Photographer Fabrice Milochau A stone arch in France is the site of a charming village, Vallon-Pont dArc, named for the bridge. The Pont dArc (bridge arc) stone formation stands over the Ardeche River at the entrance to Gorges de l'Ardeche, where visitors can access the river. Unique to this arch, which is a towering 16 stories tall, are beaches that sit on either side, where you can enjoy not only the water, sun and sand, but also a fantastic view. And you can paddle down the river for even more fabulous views of the enormous arch.

7.&nbspAzure Window, Island of Gozo, Malta ViewingMalta.com Set amid the sapphire blue seas of the Mediterranean, this rock outcropping on the tiny island of Gozo in Malta is a stunning sight to behold. Nicknamed the azure window, since it appears as a window with the deep blue waters as a backdrop, the landmark is one of the most photographed sites on the island. The arch was formed thousands of years ago when two limestone caves collapsed. Featured in the movies The Clash of the Titans and The Count of Monte Cristo, the arch is accessible via a guided boat tour through it. But you can't walk across it, due to its likelihood of collapsing. Nearby are two popular scuba diving areas  The Blue Hole and The Chimney  as well as underwater caves and an area known as the inland sea, which is shallow water set in a deep recess along the coast. During the winter, the arch is even more spectacular, with waves crashing high against the walls.","['bridge', 'natural', 'wales', 'bridges', 'national', 'formed', 'sandstone', 'stunning', 'monument', 'rock', 'world', 'arch']"

Jackie Collins Estate Is on the Market For $30M in Beverly Hills,[],"As a writer of 32 novels over her illustrious career, the late Jackie Collins obviously had an eye for detail. And she applied that same precision to the construction of her 21,784-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion.

Now on the market for $30 million, the eight-bedroom home includes five writing desks used by the author whose works included ""Hollywood Wives,"" which became a television mini-series in 1985.

The home has a two-story gallery entrance with a dramatic staircase, a 100-foot art gallery connecting to a guest apartment, a gym, a screening room, and a chef's kitchen with three islands.

Its master suite includes a living room, an office, his-and-her baths, massive walk-in closets and balconies with views of the Hollywood Hills.

Collins did most of her writing in two of the home's studies, one off her bedroom and the other next to the gym, she told the Wall Street Journal in 2014.

""My house in Beverly Hills was inspired by a David Hockney painting,"" Collins told the WSJ. ""In 1989, my husband, Oscar [Lerman], and I visited an art gallery in London, where we saw Mr. Hockney's 'A Bigger Splash.' I couldn't take my eyes off the pool and fell in love with the clean lines, suspended splash and overall tranquillity. Within days, I was sketching a design for a new home that wrapped around a pool based on the one in the painting.""

The home was completed in 1992.

The league has a lot of premium talent available, but it could be a deep draft for the conference, too.

After listing the players we see as most likely to be taken early, we take a crack at the ones who might not hear their names called on the first day or two of the draft but still have the potential to make fans of their new teams very happy.

Worth noting: All potential sleepers are not created equally. Some might have had a hard time generating headlines during their careers while others might be productive college players who have to convince NFL teams they can replicate those performances at the next level.

Either way, we're not betting against any of them finding a way to make an impact in the NFL.

Josh Ferguson, RB, Illinois

The sad state of Illinois football during Ferguson's four years in Champaign led to his getting less attention than he probably deserved, but he did leave some intriguing tape for NFL teams to find.

He missed most of October with an injury and finished the season with 988 combined rushing and passing yards in nine games.

For his career, the 5-foot-10, 195-pounder had 2,586 yards rushing and caught 168 passes for 1,507 yards with 26 combined touchdowns.

He also returned punts and kicks during his career and could project as a Julian Edelman-type at receiver or Gio Bernard if a team elects to try him at running back.

Ferguson has great open-field quickness and acceleration with the ability to make tacklers miss and break arm tackles in traffic.

He could be a big steal for a team in need of a utility offensive player.

He is among the invitees to the NFL Scouting Combine.

Joshua Perry, LB, Ohio State

A three-year starter at linebacker, Perry has proven production over time but isn't the biggest name at his position coming out of Columbus this year.

That distinction belongs to Darron Lee, who looks like a versatile potential playmaker whose best football could still be ahead of him.

At 6-foot-4 and 254 pounds, Perry is a different kind of player than Lee, who generally played to the wide side of the field while Perry did more of the dirty work inside the tackle box.

Perry was second on the team in tackles this year with 105 after leading the national champions in stops in 2014.

He notched 7.5 tackles for loss, including 3.5 sacks, in 2015 and broke up three passes.

After one year as a starter at SAM linebacker, Perry moved to WILL in Ohio State's 4-3 defense in 2014 and '15. He could play inside in the NFL, but his body type makes him look like a prototypical 3-4 linebacker.

Perry is a big, rangy athlete who can rush the passer and showed the ability to stay with running backs and tight ends in pass coverage.

A highly regarded team leader, Perry is a physical tackler and cerebral player.

Carl Nassib, DE, Penn State

Nassib may have to reprove himself on the draft circuit after winning nearly every major national defensive lineman award in 2015.

He was a unanimous All-American, but unlike Penn State tackle Austin Johnson, you won't see Nassib's name on NFL.com analyst Daniel Jeremiah's top 50 prospects. He is not among Mike Mayock's top five defensive ends, either.

Being doubted is likely of no concern to Nassib, though, who built himself from a walk-on to one of the best defensive linemen in the nation over five years at Penn State. a He might not have elite athleticism, but at 6-foot-7 and a listed 272 pounds, he has a good burst off the line and strong, heavy hands. He can get around the edge but probably lacks the type of change-of-direction teams are looking for in an early pick.

However, Nassib's frame looks like it can handle a lot more good weight, and his work ethic was proven in college. Those things and his great production last fall despite being hampered late in the season by injuries make him worth taking a look at as a value pick in the middle rounds.

Jack Allen, C, Michigan State

A two-time All-American, Allen was the glue for a Michigan State offensive line hit hard by injuries through much of his senior season.

When both starting tackles were out, he held his own at left tackle despite not having the ideal frame for that position. He also showed off an impressive stiff-arm move when he took a handoff and ran for a touchdown in a regular-season-ending rout of Penn State, so he has plenty of athleticism.

A strong, stout blocker at the point of attack, Allen is regarded as a brainy player who makes those around him better.

His 6-foot-2, 296-pound frame means he won't be playing on the edge in the NFL, but he also started five games at guard so there is plenty of position versatility for him.

Big Ten fans should know plenty about Allen, but he doesn't play the sexiest position when it comes to NFL evaluations.

Jordan Howard, RB, Indiana

A transfer from UAB, Howard had an immediate impact with the Hoosiers despite missing the equivalent of 4.5 games with injury.

He was named first-team All-Big Ten after finishing the regular season second in the conference with 134.8 yards per game on the ground

He went over 150 yards in a game five times and had two 200-yard games.

At UAB, Howard was an all-conference running back in 2014 after running for 1,587 yards for the Blazers, who did not field a team last season.

The 6-foot-1, 230-pound Howard is a big, physical runner who can move the chains. He might not burn up the track, but he has good forward lean and will break arm tackles and fall forward for more yardage.

He also has a knack for powering through gaps inside and out in Indiana's zone running game.

Nate Sudfeld, QB, Indiana

Sudfeld had a strong senior year after missing half of his junior season with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder.

At 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds, Sudfeld has an NFL frame and an adequate arm.

Though he was overshadowed by some of the other big-name quarterbacks in the Big Ten last season, Sudfeld was arguably the league's best late in the season.

A team captain, he was named the conference offensive player of the week in each of the last two weeks of the season as he completed 41 of 64 passes for 735 yards and accounted for 10 touchdowns. He was picked for the all-conference third team after leading the league in passing yards (3,184), passing efficiency and yards per attempt (8.8) during the regular season.

Although he played in an up-tempo spread offense in college, Sudfeld fits the pro-style QB mold with good size, solid arm strength and accuracy. He will not go early in the draft, but could be an excellent developmental prospect.","['nfl', 'big', 'sleepers', 'running', 'tackles', 'state', 'potential', 'draft', 'perry', 'yards', 'season', 'team']"

A pair of NASA astronauts released a capsule loaded with 1.5 tons of trash Friday as the space station soared over Bolivia. The capsule should re-enter the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly over the Pacific on Saturday.

NASA supplier Orbital ATK launched the capsule to the space station in December, full of food, clothes and other goods. The astronauts removed the precious contents, then filled it with garbage and old equipment for incineration.

Commander Scott Kelly and Timothy Kopra, the Americans on board, sent computer commands to set the Cygnus free. The stunning 250-mile-high view showed the capsule slowly backing away, its two circular solar wings looking like open umbrellas.

Kelly, who's less than two weeks from wrapping up an unprecedented yearlong mission for NASA, thanked everyone who worked on the Cygnus  ""this great vehicle.""

""It's been a pleasure,"" he noted.

""A beautiful release,"" replied Mission Control.

Virginia-based Orbital ATK plans to launch another Cygnus with more supplies from Cape Canaveral, Florida, late next month. The flight was delayed a few weeks after black mold contaminated some of the cargo bags. Technicians had to disinfect everything.

SpaceX, meanwhile, another commercial cargo carrier for NASA, is aiming to make a delivery in the next few months. The company is working to get back on track following a launch accident last summer.

NASA has handed off space station shipments to private business so it can focus on getting astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit, namely to Mars. It hopes to do the same with space station crews next year. For now, U.S. astronauts are hitching rides with the Russians.","['orbital', 'huge', 'space', 'cygnus', 'launch', 'boot', 'mission', 'astronauts', 'capsule', 'station', 'weeks', 'trash', 'nasa']"

foxnews,2016-02-15 00:00:00,"Kilmeade: On President's Day, let's remember what Thomas Jefferson knew about extremists",['Brian Kilmeade'],"Editor's note: A version of this piece originally appeared on FoxNews.com on January 8. Brian Kilmeade is the co-author of the New York Times bestseller ""Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History"" (Sentinel, November 3, 2015).

President Obama was elected on a promise to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and avoid new wars. But a funny thing happened on the way to peace  more terror attacks at home and the rapid rise of ISIS abroad.

No matter how much hed rather focus on issues like global warming and gun control, the president has to rise to the challenge of this increasing Islamist threat.

America is in the crosshairs, and Obamas legacy will depend on what he does about it in 2016.

Hes certainly not the first president to have to shift priorities on the fly. Many if not all of his predecessors entered office with a clear agenda,only to watch world events scramble their to-do lists. When that happens, great presidents adjust to new challenges -- even if it becomes necessary to break a campaign promise.

Consider our third president, Thomas Jefferson, who took office in 1801. Like Obama, Jefferson was widely considered a pacifist who preferred diplomacy over war. But when Tripoli (now Libya) declared war on us because we refused to pay extortion and ransom to the pirates off the Barbary coast, Jefferson rose to the challenge.

He started with a display of strength to intimidate our enemies, sending the U.S. Navys newest frigates to the region. When that show of power wasnt enough to get the Tripoli pirates to stop their attacks and release their hostages, Jefferson ordered bombardment from those powerful new ships.

Unfortunately, then as now, long distance bombing didnt work. To the Islamic extremists of any generation, surviving against a Western attack is considered as good as winning. Thats why airstrikes and a few ground advisors wont break the back of ISIS today. In fact, ISIS just uses our bombings to recruit more terrorists.

Although Jefferson initially saw a land war as much too risky, he kept his options open. Eventually he recognized that theres no substitute for boots on the ground. Three years into the Barbary Wars, he embraced a plan by one of Americas finest officers, General William Eaton, to invade Tripoli over land, smash its army, and break the will of its leaders.

Eaton and a detachment of Marines took the major city of Derne in less than 3 hours. Yusef Qaramanli, the Tripoli leader, quickly surrendered. A deal was cut, hostages were released, and Americas merchant ships could finally pass safely near the Barbary Coast.

President Obama still hasnt learned the key lesson that Jefferson and other presidents (most recently George W. Bush) learned about the Middle East: You cant crush an outlaw Islamist regime from the air. The more we delay putting boots on the ground against ISIS, the more the American people will lose patience  and the more power and prestige ISIS will gain for surviving our attacks.

In his final year in office, with his legacy on the line, Obama needs to realize that winning a war is more important than his pledge to end a war. He needs to empower our military and trust the experts at the Pentagon. He needs to end the irresponsible releases of terrorists from Gitmo, tighten restrictions on immigrants from countries that support terrorism, confront our enemies abroad, and do whatever it takes to keep us safe at home.

Much has changed since the early 1800s, but if President Jefferson could learn the importance of ground troops, so can our current president.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Onlookers cheer as fire damages refugee center in Germany,[],"Onlookers celebrated as a suspected arson fire damaged a former hotel being converted into a refugee home in eastern Germany, police said Sunday, raising new concerns about violence toward new arrivals in a nation that registered more than a million asylum-seekers last year.

The blaze in the roof of the building in Bautzen, in the eastern state of Saxony, broke out overnight. Police said no one was injured but a group of people gathered outside, some ""commenting with derogatory remarks or unashamed joy"" at the fire.

While most Germans have been welcoming toward refugees, a vocal minority has staged protests in front of refugee homes, especially in the east. Germany last year saw a surge in violence against such lodgings.

Police ordered three people to leave the fire scene because they were hampering firefighters' work and then temporarily detained two of them, whom they described as intoxicated 20-year-old locals, after they ignored the order.

Investigators found traces of a fire accelerant at the scene and believe the fire was caused by arson, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether the building can be restored.

Saxony is home to the anti-Islam and anti-immigration group PEGIDA, and incidents there have caused concern before. In August, a mob in Heidenau, outside Dresden, hurled bottles and fireworks at police protecting a shelter being set up for refugees.

The Bautzen fire came after a mob in the small town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony, on Thursday screamed ""We are the people!"" and ""Go home!"" as they blocked a bus carrying asylum-seekers outside a new refugee home.

Police drew criticism in that case for roughly hauling some refugees off the bus into the building  which they insist was necessary to prevent the situation from escalating  and for saying that some of the refugees had made provocative gestures.

Saxony Governor Stanislaw Tillich called the two incidents ""appalling and shocking"" and described the perpetrators as ""criminals.""

""This is abhorrent and disgusting,"" Tillich told the Funke newspaper group. He pledged that authorities will investigate and ""bring everyone responsible to account.""

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that everyone in Germany is entitled to express their concerns ""but there is a threshold of decency and law that must not be crossed  and this threshold was clearly crossed in the incidents in Saxony,"" the news agency dpa reported.

""It is completely unacceptable for people who are seeking protection from persecution here to be greeted with hatred and agitation,"" de Maiziere added.

Later Sunday, the minister defended police actions in Clausnitz, saying they were right to get all the refugees off the bus quickly and into the building. If the bus had been backed away from the refugee home, ""these bawling people would have had their way,"" de Maiziere said on ARD television.","['building', 'maiziere', 'group', 'center', 'saxony', 'bus', 'refugee', 'outside', 'cheer', 'germany', 'damages', 'incidents', 'refugees', 'onlookers']"

Captain Ryan Getzlaf extended his point streak to eight games with a third-period goal for the streaking Ducks, who have won 12 of 14 to improve to 19-4-2 since Christmas. Anaheim also trimmed Los Angeles' lead to two points atop the Pacific Division.

Patrick Maroon and Kevin Bieksa also had power-play goals as Anaheim beat the Flames at home for the 22nd consecutive time.

Captain Mark Giordano scored his career-best 15th goal and former Ducks goalie Jonas Hiller stopped 28 shots for the Flames, who have lost four of five.

Mikael Backlund added a last-minute goal for Calgary, which hasn't won a regular-season game at Honda Center since Jan. 19, 2004.

Kesler had his first three-point game of the season in the Ducks' dynamic return from a seven-game road trip during which they won five times and surged into second place in the Pacific.

Anaheim even scored five goals for the fourth consecutive game, continuing the offense's sharp turnaround after being the league's lowest-scoring team for most of the season. The Ducks chased Hiller while beating the Flames 6-4 in Calgary six days ago.

Maroon put the Ducks ahead late in the first period with his fourth goal of the season, pouncing after Calgary's Lance Bouma went down in pain while blocking a shot.

Kesler ended a 10-game goal drought with a wrist shot early in the second, but Giordano scored less than two minutes later, converting a slick pass from Johnny Gaudreau on a power play.

The Ducks quickly seized control in the third period. Getzlaf scored his 19th point in 13 games on a pass from David Perron just 16 seconds in, and Kesler made it 4-1 shortly afterward when he ripped the puck away from Deryk Engelland for an unassisted goal.

After Bieksa scored a goal in his second straight game, Backlund got his sixth goal in eight games with 45 seconds left.

NOTES: Flames D Kris Russell missed his fourth straight game with a lower-body injury. ... Ducks F Andrew Cogliano played in his 680th consecutive game, passing Henrik Sedin for the sixth-longest streak in NHL history. Cogliano also has the second-longest streak to begin a career. ...

By the time it came to the end of the race, many of the pre-race favorites had raced themselves out of contention including Dale Earnhardt Jr., who wrecked with 30 laps to go while struggling to get back up front.

Sprint Cup rookie Chase Elliott, the youngest pole-sitter in Daytona 500 history, led the field to green with Matt Kenseth starting alongside Elliott on the front row.

Elliott elected to start on the inside with Hendrick Motorsports teammate Earnhardt Jr. lined up behind him to push. Together, they quickly surged to the lead with Elliott in front and Earnhardt on his bumper.

But by Lap 5, Earnhardt had surged into the lead.

And on Lap 19, Elliott's day ended in disaster when his No. 24 Chevy got loose in the middle of Turn 4 on Lap 19 and started to go around, tail first. After contact with Carl Edwards who was on the low line, Elliott spun onto pit road and then into the tri-oval grass.

When Elliott hit the grass, it tore the splitter off his car, which got stuck in the infield. Elliott's car had to be towed into the garage.

Elliott took full blame for the incident.

Asked what happened, Elliott replied: ""I'm not sure, just got turned around there off of four. Got in the middle and got loose. Lost it and spun out. I hate it for everybody at less than 20 laps in and have something dumb like that happen. I apologize to my guys.""

After his Hendrick Motorsports crew made repairs, Elliott rejoined the race on Lap 59, 40 laps down.

There were other incidents throughout the race.

On Lap 56, last year's winner, Joey Logano checked up coming out of Turn 4 and was hit from behind by Brian Vickers, who went on a lurid spin in the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Edwards took evasive action to avoid Vickers' car, and when he did, Edwards hit the wall, incurring front-end damage on his JGR Toyota.

On Lap 92, rookie Chris Buescher and Matt DiBenedetto got tangled up and crashed hard into the outside wall, ruining both of their days.

""I really saw nothing,"" Buescher said. ""Matt was in (the infield care center) with us and he apologized, and I appreciate that. I just hate it for Love's Travel Stops coming on board for our first Daytona 500, and to leave it like this is not ideal by any means.""

DiBenedetto later added: ""I have no excuse. I went in there with a head of steam and got sideways.""

And on Lap 116, Greg Biffle slapped the outside wall, bringing out the fourth caution and doing considerable damage to his No. 16 Roush Fenway Racing Ford.

Hamlin led 94 of the first 155 laps before giving up the lead to come to pit road for a green-flag stop with 45 to go.

Meanwhile, four drivers who were among the pre-race favorites combined to dominate the first 120 laps of the race with Hamlin, defending Sprint Cup champion Kyle Busch, Jimmie Johnson and Earnhardt combining to lead 111 of those laps.

Hamlin led the most and soon cycled back into the lead following pit stops after Biffle's incident.

Instead the U.S. called for North Koreas atomic-weapons program to be simply part of the talks. Pyongyang declined the counter-proposal, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. Its nuclear test on Jan. 6 ended the diplomatic gambit.

The episode, in an exchange at the United Nations, was one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obamas second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.

The State Department on Sunday acknowledged the U.S. exchange with North Korea, saying it took place in accordance with longstanding U.S. goals.

To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty. We carefully considered their proposal, and made clear that denuclearization had to be part of any such discussion, said spokesman John Kirby, adding the North rejected it. Our response to the North Korean proposal was consistent with our longstanding focus on denuclearization.

Mr. Obama has pointed to the Iran deal to signal to North Korea that he is open to a similar track with the regime of Kim Jong Un. But the White House sees North Korea as far more opaque and uncooperative. The latest fruitless exchanges typified diplomacy between the U.S. and Pyongyang in recent years.

Since taking power at the end of 2011, Mr. Kim has stepped up the Norths demands for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, 63 years after it ended with an armistice. Many analysts see the move as an attempt to force the removal of the U.S. military in the South. The U.S. insists denuclearization must have priority, and said that has to be part of any peace talks, even while dropping the precondition that North Korea first take steps that show a willingness to give up its nuclear program.

Pyongyang rejects that. For North Korea, winning a peace treaty is the center of the U.S. relationship, said Go Myung-hyun, an expert on North Korea at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul-based think tank. It feels nuclear development gives it a bigger edge to do so.

The international reaction to North Koreas January nuclear test and follow-up rocket launch this month was swift, with Japan imposing new penalties on Pyongyang, South Korea closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had filled the Norths coffers and American lawmakers passing a bill to tighten economic sanctions against the regime. Mr. Obama signed the bill into law last Thursday.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Donald Trump muses about Marco Rubio's eligibility to run for president,[],"Marco Rubio has joined Ted Cruz in Donald Trumps crosshairs.

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","['video', 'marco', 'run', 'trump', 'born', 'muses', 'naturalborn', 'rubio', 'rubios', 'eligibility', 'donald', 'cruz', 'trumps', 'citizen', 'president', 'george']"

Noreen was scheduled to go into the hospital to have three ribs treated for small tumors, a procedure called cryoablation (which she has undergone before). Two days before she was to have the procedure, she woke up in excruciating pain.

At first they thought it was her heart, but then decided it was another rib, in the front. She went in for the cryoablation procedure (now for four ribs), and Dr. Genshaft was surprised. It wasnt a fourth rib, it was her gallbladder.

Noreen had a hot gallbladder (inflamed).**

The question then became: Do they remove the gallbladder or drain it for eight to 10 weeks? Because of her somewhat deteriorating physical condition, they decided to put in a drain.

Thats where we are.

When her pain subsides enough from the gallbladder attack, she will be scheduled for the cryoablation procedure on the three ribs.

Of course, with all that work going into building your contact network, you don't want to lose it.

That's why making a backup on your computer is a good idea. Plus, having your contact list separate from LinkedIn means you don't have to log in to find someone. Fortunately, LinkedIn makes it easy to export your contacts to a regular spreadsheet.

Once you have all your contacts' information in a spreadsheet, you can print it out and run your finger down the list or search to find who you need. Or, you can copy and paste one or hundreds of email addresses from your LinkedIn spreadsheet to your email or Webmail. Of course, you can also export LinkedIn contacts directly to your email, if you want. Still, a spreadsheet is a bit more versatile.

HOW TO EXPORT LINKEDIN CONNECTIONS TO A SPREADSHEET

If you heard that LinkedIn got rid of its export-to-a-spreadsheet feature, it did for a while. That was to prevent unsavory businesses from scraping LinkedIn users' email addresses. Scraping is when companies use people's email addresses to market their products to them, or sell those email addresses to other companies.

However, enough people complained that LinkedIn brought the feature back. Still, it's one of several reason you want to be careful what email address you give out on LinkedIn. With that cleared up, let's talk exporting.

To export your connections to a spreadsheet, go to your LinkedIn profile. From near the top of the page, select My Network>>Connections. Then click the Settings gear icon in the upper-right corner.

Under Advanced Settings on the right side of the page, click on

""Export LinkedIn Connections."" Then from the ""Export To""

drop-down menu, select the .CSV file for Outlook or Yahoo Mail.

A .CSV, or Comma Separated Value, file is nice because it will open in any spreadsheet program, like Excel or the free LibreOffice. If you're using Mac, you can also select the .VCF file type to use with Mac's Address Book.

Once your file type is selected, click the Export button and

save the file. Open the file in an Excel or another spreadsheet program, to start making the most of all those LinkedIn connections you've made over the years.

While you're looking at your contacts, you might realize that

there are some you don't need anymore; they're just bogging down the rest of your list. That's why it's good every once in a while to go through your contacts and get rid the ones you're sure you don't need anymore.

Here's how: Near the top of the LinkedIn homepage, select My Network>>Connections. Highlight a connection's photo and choose More>>Remove Connection (it might say, Remove from Contacts). Just be sure you back up first, in case you accidentally delete someone.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"Friends, colleagues remember those slain in Kalamazoo area",[],"A dedicated teacher who mentored numerous students. A gardener who enjoyed sharing what she grew. A mother known for her pleasant demeanor even when faced with adversity. A high school senior who always had a smile on his face.

These are the ways friends and colleagues are remembering the victims of a shooting rampage in western Michigan. Four of them were killed in two vehicles Saturday outside of a restaurant, while a father and son were shot at a car dealership.

Below are some of their stories.

___

MARY JO NYE

The 60-year-old retired English teacher served as ""a motherly figure"" to students at an alternative high school for at-risk teens, coaching even the most reluctant ones to become better writers.

The Battle Creek, Michigan, resident would work one-on-one with students to get them to open up verbally, then put their thoughts on paper and structure them into written compositions, said Tara Egnatuk, assistant director of the Calhoun Community High School where Nye worked.

""She got even the most reluctant writers in our school to express themselves on paper. She would do baby steps with them where they might come in and not even be able to read. She would have them leaving with skills that were amazing compared to where they started,"" said Egnatuk, who was mentored by Nye during their six years of working together.

While Nye didn't have children of her own, she played an important role in the lives of students.

""She was an English teacher, but she was a lot more than that to the students who don't come from great home lives,"" Egnatuk said. ""She really had a position of mentorship, kind of a motherly figure for a lot of these kids.""

Egnatuk said Nye helped launch the school by working on writing its charter and retired four years ago. The school's website lists its mission as helping ""students who have not found success in traditional high schools.""

Since retiring, Nye enjoyed quilting, playing Scrabble and volunteering at her church while continuing to tutor students, Egnatuk said. Nye had also worked previously as a literacy specialist for the state of Michigan.

A Michigan State Police news release said that Nye was shot in the driver's seat of a Chevrolet Cruze, while two of her passengers were killed and another was wounded. The driver of a nearby minivan, 62-year-old Mary Lou Nye of Baroda, whom Egnatuk believes was Nye's sister-in-law, was also killed.

""I'm getting calls and emails and messages from former students who are just devastated,"" Egnatuk said.

Cheryl Chubinski, a school secretary who knew Nye for 20 years, said Nye would bring in a sewing machine, do cooking demonstrations and show students how to make homemade gifts at Christmas.

""It's not like we had tons of resources, but she certainly brought in those things any way she could,"" she said.

Chubinski said that helping students believe in themselves was a greater reward than monetary compensation for her friend.

""You didn't need a raise. You needed the kids to say, 'Thank you Ms. Nye. You helped me make it,'"" she said.

MARY LOU NYE

Mary Lou Nye maintained a positive outlook even when dealing with adversity such as rebuilding a house heavily damaged by a tornado, her neighbor said.

The 63-year-old lived with her husband, Chris, on property that had been in his family for many years, said Carol Dinges, who lives across the street in Baroda. After the tornado about five years ago, the couple had to live in their camper for a while the house was being fixed, but Dinges said her neighbor took it in stride.

""Every time I spoke with her, she was just pleasant,"" she said.

Nye worked at one time as a manager in a driver's license office, Dinges said.

The couple had two sons, though one had died at a young age from a heart ailment, Dinges said.

Nye enjoyed going on camping trips several times a year with her husband, Dinges said. The neighbors would watch each other's houses on the farmland-lined road during trips.

""They went camping quite often. They would go several times a year,"" she said.

Nye worked part time in recent years in the preschool and childcare program at Immanuel Lutheran Ministries in Bridgman, just a few miles from Baroda. Pastor Jon Bendewald said she always had a smile on her face and was loved by the children she worked with.

""It was never about her, always about making sure things were right for the children,"" he said.

DOROTHY BROWN

After Dorothy Brown moved in two doors down from Patrick Mallon Jr. in Battle Creek about 10 years ago, the woman everyone knew as Judy would stop by to share herbs she had grown in her garden, her neighbor said.

Mallon recounted how Brown was thrilled when his granddaughters went to her home to give her tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers they had grown.

Brown would always wave and say hello when she drove off to the mall, where she walked for exercise, Mallon said. He added that whenever he and his wife went on vacation, it was Brown they would ask to keep an eye on the house and feed their cat.

And, he said, after it snowed he would make sure to shovel in front of her home  something she'd always appreciate.

""She would give us a gift card to a nice restaurant, something like that,"" he said.

Mallon said Brown, 74, had two grown sons, with one living in California and the other in Florida.

TYLER SMITH

A western Michigan school superintendent said her tight-knit community is mourning the loss of senior Tyler Smith, a 17-year-old who always had a ""smile on his face.""

Smith was killed Saturday night along with his father, Richard, outside of a Kalamazoo car dealership.

Tyler Smith spent half of each school day at a technical center focusing on marketing, Mattawan Consolidated Schools Superintendent Robin Buchler said. She added that her son, also a senior, described Tyler Smith as ""well-liked"" with a constant ""smile on his face.""","['kalamazoo', 'brown', 'colleagues', 'remember', 'area', 'students', 'egnatuk', 'school', 'dinges', 'high', 'slain', 'smile', 'worked', 'friends', 'michigan', 'nye']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,ISIS frees last group of Syrian Christians abducted in 2015,[],"The Islamic State group on Monday released the last of some 230 Assyrian Christians kidnapped a year ago in Syria after the receiving millions of dollars in ransom, Christian officials said.

Younan Talia, of the Assyrian Democratic Organization, told The Associated Press that about 40 remaining Christian captives were released early Monday and are on their way to the northeastern town of Tal Tamr.

Younan said the release came after mediation led by a top Assyrian priest in northern Syria.

The extremists captured the Assyrians, members of an ancient Christian sect, last February after overrunning several communities on the southern bank of the Khabur River in northeastern Hassakeh province.

Kidnapping for ransom is a main source of income for the extremists. In November, ISIS said it killed a Norwegian and a Chinese captive after demanding ransom for their release two months earlier.

Talia said ISIS demanded a ransom of $18 million for the Assyrian Christians. He said the figure was later lowered following negotiations. He said he did not know the final amount.

Osama Edward, director of the Stockholm-based Assyrian Human Rights Network, said 42 Christians, mostly young women and children, were released. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said 42 were released, including at least 17 women.

A Syrian Christian figure said the worldwide Assyrian community launched a campaign for the captives' release shortly after they were abducted. He said a bank account was opened in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil and donations began to flow in from around the world.

""We paid large amounts of money, millions of dollars, but not $18 million,"" said the man, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the sensitive mediation. ""We paid less than half the amount.""

The official added that the fate of five Assyrians who went missing during the abductions was still unknown.

ISIS attacked a cluster of villages along the Khabur River, sending thousands of people fleeing to safer areas and capturing the Assyrians over a period of three days. Over the next two days, the extremists picked up dozens more from 11 communities near Tal Tamr.

The Hassakeh province, which borders Turkey and Iraq, has become the latest battleground in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. It is predominantly Kurdish but also has Arabs, Assyrians and Armenians.

On Friday, the predominantly Kurdish Syria Democratic Forces captured the ISIS stronghold of Shaddadeh in Hassakeh, where some of the kidnapped were once believed to have been held.

Many Syrian Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million, left for Europe over the past 20 years, with the flight gathering speed since the country's conflict began in March 2011.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Russia guilty of 'egregious' war crimes in Syria, human rights group says",[],"Amnesty International has told Sky News that Russia is guilty of some the most ""egregious"" war crimes it has seen in decades.

The human rights organization claims Moscow's warplanes have been deliberately targeting civilians and rescue workers in Syria over the last week.

Tirana Hassan, director of Amnesty's crisis response program, said the attacks are ongoing, with strikes documented on schools, hospitals and civilian homes.

She claimed the bombing of civilian targets by Russian and Syrian forces was in itself a war crime, but warned there have been consistent reports of additional bombardments which injure and kill humanitarian workers and civilians attempting to evacuate the wounded and the dead.

The Kremlin denies it has been hitting civilian areas and insists it is dropping bombs only on terrorist targets.

However, evidence obtained by Sky News suggests that this is not the case.

Footage filmed in Aleppo five days ago shows the graphic aftermath of what's claimed to be a Russian airstrike.

The video is harrowing. In it, the body of a five-month-old baby called Omar can be seen being pulled from the rubble.

His twin brother, sister and mother were also killed in the attack on a residential building in eastern Aleppo.

It is an area which is currently held by the moderate Free Syrian Army.

Rescue workers claim the assaults are happening every day, and that civilian areas are being hit by cluster and thermobaric bombs.

With the cease-fire non-existent, the refugee camps inside Syria and on Turkey's borders are growing every day.

More than half of Syria's population are now displaced - that's 11 million people forced from their homes by conflict.

And as conditions inside the camps are basic, many more people will soon start making the journey to Europe.

foxnews,2016-02-16 00:00:00,Flower preserved in amber was ancestor of modern poisonous plants,['Michael Casey'],"Scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a flower entombed in Dominican amber, the first-ever specimen of a plant family that has given the world some of the deadliest poisons, including strychnine.

The perfectly-preserved flowers named Strychnos electri are estimated by researchers from Oregon State and Rutgers universities to be from 20 million to 30 million years old.

It comes from the family of flowering plants called asteroid that gave us potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, petunias and our morning cup of coffee. But this one is from the genus Strychnos, which ultimate produce strychnine and curare  poisons used in everything from rat control to blow-gun weapons. Strychnine also played a part in the movie Psycho, in which Norman Bates uses rat poison to kill his mother and her boyfriend.

""The specimens are beautiful, perfectly preserved fossil flowers, which at one point in time were borne by plants that lived in a steamy tropical forest with both large and small trees, climbing vines, palms, grasses and other vegetation,"" Oregon States George Poinar, Jr. one of the world's experts on plant and animal life forms preserved in amber and a co-author of the discovery in the journal Nature Plants, said in a statement.

""Specimens such as this are what give us insights into the ecology of ecosystems in the distant past,"" he said. ""It shows that the asterids, which later gave humans all types of foods and other products, were already evolving many millions of years ago.""

The discovery of these two fossil flowers, researchers said, suggests that many other related plant families could have evolved in the Late Cretaceous in tropical forests and adds an important piece to the evolutionary jigsaw puzzle of neotropical forests that existed in the mid-Tertiary, long before North and South America were connected by the Panama land bridge.

Strychnos electri provides evidence that highly derived asterid groups were present in the mixed neotropical forest by the mid-Tertiary, Poinar and the other co-author Lena Struwe of Rutgers University, wrote. This suggests that many other present-day neotropical asterid genera and their families had also evolved by this time but their remains have not yet been discovered.

Asterids are among Earth's most important and diverse plants, with 10 orders, 98 families, and about 80,000 species. They represent about one-third of all the Earth's diversity of angiosperms, or flowering plants.

And one ancient genus, which has now been shown to be inherently toxic, existed for millions of years before humans appeared on the planet.

""Species of the genus Strychnos are almost all toxic in some way,"" Poinar said. ""Each plant has its own alkaloids with varying effects. Some are more toxic than others, and it may be that they were successful because their poisons offered some defense against herbivores.

There are now about 200 species of Strychnos plants around the world, in forms ranging from shrubs to trees and woody climbing vines, mostly in the tropics. They are still being studied for medicinal properties, such as for the treatment of parasitic worm infections and for drugs to treat malaria.","['plants', 'amber', 'plant', 'flower', 'poisons', 'poisonous', 'modern', 'strychnos', 'neotropical', 'poinar', 'preserved', 'fossil', 'genus', 'toxic', 'ancestor', 'flowers']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Medieval shipwreck hauled from the deep,[],"A nearly intact medieval shipwreck has been hauled from the frigid waters of a Dutch river.

The boat was likely deliberately sunk by maritime engineers more than 600 years ago in an effort to alter the flow of the Ijssel River, an offshoot of the mighty Rhine River that flows through six European countries. The trading ship sailed at a time when the Hanseatic League, a group of guilds that fostered trade across Europe, dominated the seas.

""The fact that we were able to raise the Ijssel cog [a type of wooden vessel] in its entirety and in one attempt is a fantastic achievement by the entire team,"" lead maritime archaeologist Wouter Waldus said in a statement. ""The shipwreck can become a symbol of our rich maritime history, and I fully expect many people, both young and old, to be amazed by and start enjoying this ship from the Hanseatic period's fascinating story."" [See Images of the Medieval Trading Ship and Reconstruction]

Surprise discovery

The boat was first discovered in 2012 at the river bottom during efforts to widen the flow of the Ijssel River. The massive ship was lying perpendicular to the river flow, along with a medieval barge and a punt, a specialized ship designed for navigating river deltas.

Over the course of the next three years, maritime archaeologists put in place a painstaking, meticulous plan to recover the ancient seafaring vessel. First, the team built a platform and crane on the river, then built a protective frame around the ship to lift it out of the water. After suctioning gunk from the area inside the frame, the archeological team created 3D images of the boat underwater. Only then were the team members ready to carefully lift the boat out of the water, using a basketlike structure made of straps, crossbeams and jacks. Each strap had its own motorized control to allow perfectly precise maneuvering in response to the forces experienced in the ship.

""This was an incredibly involved operation and was almost as impressive as the cog itself. The raising of the 65 feet ship was complex, in the middle of the river, near the navigation channel. Also, as a result of the fact, three different specializations had to work together here: an archaeological research team, divers and storage specialists,"" said Ben Broens, an official with the Rijkswaterstaat, a water management bureau in the Dutch government, which helped oversee the salvage operation.

Medieval cog

It turned out the 55-ton (50 tonnes) ship was a medieval cog, a type of wooden vessel with a steep, straight ship prow and deck beams that stick out from the boat's skin. Cogs were typically used in the late medieval period on international trade voyages. Many of the structural support elements, such as nails, were made of metal, meaning it was sturdier, and therefore easier to take out of the water without falling apart.

The team believes the ancient seafaring vessel was likely sunk deliberately. It was placed perpendicular in the stream of the river. By looking at medieval maps and historical documents and recreating the historical path of the river, the team found the ship was sunk at a time when silt was building up, creating huge sandbanks along the Ijssel River. Those sandbanks would have prevented ships from docking properly, so the ship, along with the barge and punt, were likely sent to the bottom of the river in a bid to narrow the river flow or divert it in a way that would improve sea traffic.

Though the ship was stripped of much of its original finery, the team did find an intact brick oven, as well as gorgeous glazed tiles, in the galley area of the ship.

Now that the ship is safely out of the water, the team will transport it inside its custom-made frame to a preservation facility in Leylstad, the Netherlands. There, it will undergo a painstaking process of drying out, which could take another three years. If all goes well, the Ijssel Cog will be placed on display in a museum. But if the ship can't be dried out safely, it will be studied thoroughly before being destroyed.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Former Miss America contestant Cara McCollum dies after car crash,[],"A former Miss America contestant died early Monday, a week after her car spun off a New Jersey highway and crashed into trees.

Cara McCollum died at Cooper University Hospital, according to Frank DiMauro, chief operating officer of the TV station where she worked, and a Facebook message posted by her family.

Her family said in the Facebook post that the 24-year-old from Margate died with her family by her side in an operating room, and that her organs were donated.

""We've prayed constantly for a miracle, and we believe God has answered our prayers. Although it's not the miracle that we first envisioned, it's a miracle nonetheless,"" the family said. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years. ... We all will miss her now that she's gone.""

Her family posted a video of McCollum performing a version of ""Cups"" by Anna Kendrick in the film ""Pitch Perfect.""

The song includes the lyrics ""you're gonna miss me when I'm gone"" and was performed by Miss New York Kira Kazantsev when she won the Miss America pageant in September 2014. McCollum competed in the previous year's pageant after winning the 2013 Miss New Jersey title.

The Arkansas native graduated from Princeton University and was an anchor on SNJ Today, a news show serving the southern Jersey area.

She was dating Keith Jones, a TV anchor for Philadelphia's NBC affiliate.

""Please accept our sincerest thanks for your heartfelt prayers,"" Jones wrote on Facebook. ""Words fall short of describing the pain, but I'm eternally grateful and blessed for the time I spent with Cara. Her enormous heart enriched my life and changed me forever.""

McCollum was alone in her vehicle and was not wearing a seatbelt when her Mustang veered off Route 55 in Pittsgrove Township and struck a tree, then spun again and hit two more trees before ending up in an embankment, police said.

State police say McCollum appeared to have been driving too fast for conditions on the wet road. They do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.

Brunson has definitely rocketed to the top of the prospects list in the middleweight division, especially with his last three wins, which all ended inside the first round.

Taking on a noted ground specialist in Carneiro on Sunday, Brunson knew he had to be wary of going to the mat and he showed off some impressive striking in the opening moments of the fight.

WHAT. A. BEATDOWN. #UFCPittsburgh @DerekBrunson https://t.co/MVx0cYH4It  FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) February 22, 2016

The pressure eventually forced Carneiro to slip to the ground, but rather than allow his opponent to get up again, Brunson just mounted the pressure by leaping down onto the mat with him and blasting away with huge, heavy punches.

With Carneiro trapped against the cage, Brunson's barrage was unrelenting with machine gun like fire as he continuously punched at the Brazilian.

Finally, Brunson slipped through a few shots that tagged Carneiro flush as he rolled to his side with nowhere left to go and no chance to defend himself as the referee finally stepped in to stop the carnage.

""I'm a straight animal,"" Brunson said after the win.

Considering Brunson's recent win streak it's going to be awfully hard to deny him a fight against a top 10 opponent for his next bout later this year.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Brain fitness program may ease cognitive impairment in elderly,[],"Many elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment experienced better brain function after a ""fitness"" program designed to sharpen their minds, a U.S. study suggests.

Researchers put 127 elderly people on what they called a brain fitness regimen for 12 weeks that included meditation training, cognitive behavior therapy, and education about the Mediterranean diet, exercise, stress reduction and proper sleep habits.

By the end of the program, 84% of participants experienced significant improvements in cognitive function, researchers reported in a paper released online February 5 in the Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.

Among the random sample of 17 patients who received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the beginning and end of the program, 12 had either no atrophy during the study or some growth in brain volume in their hippocampus, the region responsible for memory.

""You can choose a lifestyle that promotes rapid brain atrophy and dementia or one that accelerates brain growth and vitality,"" said lead study author Dr. Majid Fotuhi, a researcher at NeuroGrow Brain Fitness Center in McLean, Virginia, and at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

""You need to decide if you can make choices that will rejuvenate your brain on a daily basis,"" Fotuhi added by email.

Fotuhi and colleagues tested their brain fitness program in a group of elderly patients who were 71 years old on average.

At the start of the program, patients underwent standardized neurology evaluations to determine and address any potential medical causes for memory loss and cognitive impairment such as sleep apnea, depression or vitamin B12 deficiency.

Every participant also underwent MRI and brain mapping at the start of the program.

Then each week for the next three months, they all got two hours of cognitive skills training and neurofeedback therapy, which used sound and images to prompt the brain's circuits to work and then to rest. They also had one hour a week of counseling and coaching on lifestyle changes that are linked to better brain health.

Overall, 84% of patients had statistically significant improvements in at least three out of 10 areas of cognitive function, while another 9% had significant gains in at least two areas.

Among the subset of people who got follow-up MRIs at the end of the study, 9 of 17 patients had at least a 1% expansion in the volume of the hippocampus, enough to dial back the brain's age by several years and improve cognitive abilities.

Limitations of the study include the small size, the lack of randomization or a control group, and the difficulty of determining which of the many interventions may have been the most beneficial to cognitive function in elderly patients, the authors note.

""It is not yet proven how such an approach stalled atrophy or encouraged regrowth as measured by an increased volume,"" said Dr. Dale Bredesen, founding president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, in an email. Bredesen wasn't involved in the study.

Many of the elements of the brain fitness program may have benefits that go beyond memory or cognitive abilities, said Stephanie Peabody, a neuropsychologist at Harvard Medical School who wasn't involved in the study.

""Brain health is inextricably tied to overall health; those without injury to the brain and/or thought or mood disorders live a healthier lifestyle, have fewer chronic diseases and remain healthier into older age,"" Peabody said by email. ""Beyond this, those who optimize lifestyle behaviors including sleep, activity and nutrition are able to optimize almost all aspects of brain functioning.""","['function', 'lifestyle', 'cognitive', 'ease', 'elderly', 'volume', 'brain', 'patients', 'program', 'fitness', 'impairment', 'study']"

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,"America, we could be looking at a Trump, Clinton contest","['Jessica Tarlov', 'Douglas E']","For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

UFC fighter Ronda Rousey got caught posting a photo of herself that was altered to make her appear slimmer  but not by her, she swears.

Following an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jimmy Fallon, Rousey shared an image of herself on Instagram. Her eagle-eyed fans quickly began commenting on whether the photo had been digitally altered  making her arms, waistline and face look skinnier.

A couple of days later, Rousey, 28, reposted the image side-by-side with the unretouched version. ""I was sent a picture to share on social for Fallon that was altered without me knowing,"" she explained. ""I won't say by who.""

The former UFC champion apologized in the post, adding, ""This goes against everything I believe, and I am extremely proud of every inch of my body. And I can assure you all it will never happen again. I could not be more appalled and hope you all forgive me.""

A few hours later she posted the original photo by itself.

Rousey has been an advocate of positive body image. When she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition recently she told the New York Times that, at one point, she was self-conscious about her seemingly masculine arms, she now flaunts them.

She has also posed naked on the cover of ESPN the Magazine and has appeared in sexy shoots for Maxim, she said, in an effort to embrace the body that used to embarrass her.

On December 27, Kim checked in to the hospital where doctors discovered two brain tumors and diagnosed her with grade 4 glioblastoma, WTSP.com reported.

If it wasnt for the baby, she probably wouldve never gone to the hospital, Phil Vaillancourt, Kims husband, told WTSP.com. With her severe headache and nausea and she wouldve laid in bed thinking it was the flu, and she wouldve possibly not been here today. We definitely feel that God put that baby in her for a reason; pretty much to save her life.

Kim underwent emergency surgery at Buffalo General Medical Center to remove the tumors, but she cannot undergo radiation and chemotherapy due to the pregnancy. Dr. Ajay Abad of Roswell Park Cancer Institute told WTSP that without the treatment, the tumors will grow back within 8 to 12 weeks, and she likely only has six to eight months to live.

The baby gave me a chance. Ive got to give the baby a chance, Kim told the news station. For now, the plan is for Kim to have an MRI every two weeks to watch for tumors, and she will begin radiation and chemotherapy a few weeks after delivering her baby on May 16.

It is sort of a race against time, Abad told WTSP.

The rest of the family, which include Ryan, 12, Hailey, 11, Kamila, 10, Josie, 7, and Charlie, 6, are taking on more chores to help out as they try to process what is happening to Kim. Two of the children require homeschooling and Josie was born without arms or legs.

I know its happening for a reason. I just dont know what the reason is, Ryan told WTSP.

Kim wants to live long enough to see her kids graduate, get married and start their own lives, but patients with grade 4 glioblastoma are often given one year to live.

Im in one of two places, Kim told WTSP. I either get to stay with Phil and the kids and live a long life. Or I get to go home and be with Jesus. Im OK. [Phils] the one thats stuck holding everything and trying to juggle all of this craziness.

While the family is relying on prayer, the financial needs of five children and Kims medical bills are growing, and a friend has set up a GoFundMe account to fundraise.

After pulling in a massive $152.2 million in its President's Day weekend four-day debut, the comic book adaptation from 20th Century Fox starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed mercenary again topped the North American box office. Having already grossed $235.4 million domestically, ""Deadpool""  made for just $58 million  is poised to become one of the most successful R-rated movies ever.

Globally, the film  now certain to spawn a franchise of its own  has made $491.1 million thus far.

Among new releases, the faith-based drama ""Risen"" debuted with $11.8 million. The film, in which Joseph Fiennes plays a Roman soldier investigating the death and resurrection of Jesus, was made for about $20 million by Sony's Affirm label, which targets evangelical Christian moviegoers.

A24's critically acclaimed Puritan thriller ""The Witch"" opened with $8.7 million, marking the biggest opening of the indie label behind the Oscar-nominated drama ""Room."" A24 celebrated Robert Eggers' directorial debut  an austere 1600s horror film, rigorously authentic to the period  as not only the company's biggest weekend in its three-year history, but one that put ""The Witch"" on course to be ""the most successful film of all time with a goat in a starring role.""

It may have been too art house for some horror fans, though, as ""The Witch"" received a poor C-minus CinemaScore from audiences.

The Jesse Owens biopic from Focus Features, ""Race,"" struggled to find its footing with $7.3 million. Directed by Stephen Hopkins, ""Race"" stars Stephan James as the Olympic sprinter.

Edging out the three debuts was Fox's ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" which made $12.5 million in its fourth weekend. The animated sequel, which has made $117.1 million in total, will lose its near-exclusive window of family moviegoing next weekend when Disney's ""Zootopia"" opens. That film has already begun its overseas rollout, where it made $31.2 million from 22 territories over the weekend.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The surprising new reason why eating fried foods may be good for you,[],"Attention, French fry addicts: Your favorite food may not be so terrible for you after all.

At least, that's the conclusion made by a recent study published in Food Chemistry that found that the antioxidant content of deep-fried potatoes, pumpkin, tomatoes, and eggplant was significantly higher than sauteed or boiled veggies.

It's no secret among nutritionists that adding a fat source to vegetablese.g., roasting them with olive oil or using full-fat salad dressing over the fat-free stuffboosts absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. So it's not totally illogical that deep-frying could take things a step further: When vegetables are fried in a healthy oil (think extra virgin olive oil), antioxidant compounds called phenols in the oil are transferred to veggies, said Frances Largeman-Roth, RD, author of Eating in Color, who was not involved in the study. In other words, a hot oil bath doesn't just unlock nutrients already inside vegetablesit actually helps infuse them with more nutrients than they started with.

MORE: The Super Common Oil That Science Now Shows Is Worse Than Sugar

As for other greasy goodies like fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, and cheese curds, researchers don't know whether these foods soak up any phenols at all when fried. Largeman-Roth speculates that these foods have lower water content than vegetables, which doesn't allow them to soak up as much oil (and, consequently, phenols), if any at all.

These findings, while exciting, don't give you a carte blanche to go crazy on those fried zucchini chips whenever you feel like it, though. All that oiland batter if veggies are coated before fried, which most aremeans major calories, which could spell a fast-track to weight gain, overconsumption, and other health problems.

Also, researchers fried veggies in extra virgin olive oil, which is known for its sky-high levels of phenols. Frying in regular olive oil or refined vegetable oils prolific used by most restaurants might not have had the same effect, Largeman-Roth said. Even worse, some restaurant frying oils contain trans fat. (Here are 14 cooking oils and which is the healthiest for you.)

Oil temperature is also an issue. While frying in EVOO can imbue your veggies with more antioxidants, those benefits backfire if the oil gets too hot.

""If you heat any oil past its smoke point, it starts to break down and release free radicals,"" Largman-Roth said.

The study used a fry temperature of around 350 degrees, which is safely below extra virgin olive oil's 400 degree smoke point. (Try this healthy gluten-free 'fried' chicken.)

Of course, you can't control the type of oil or temperature used in a restaurant fryer, but you can at home. What to do? If you want to eat fried food as an occasional indulgence, stick to vegetables that you fry at home in high-quality oil, using a fry thermometer to make sure the oil doesn't go above its smoke point.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,How the margarita got its name,['Ali Rosen'],"There is nothing better in summer than sitting outside with a cold margarita  or as Jimmy Buffet might say, wasting away in Margaritaville.

But while it seems the potent combination of tequila, triple sec and lime has always been with us, there was a time before the margarita had its name.

And much like the drink today, with its classic style or frozen variations, there is much debate about the real story of the margarita.

Whats in a Name?

The only thing that is sure in the history of the margarita is that, ""there is no fact, Dominic Alcocer, the director Olmeca Altos and Tequila Avion at alcohol producer Pernod Ricard says. That's the fun part, that's the myth.

Like many drinks, the margarita at least two histories: one that tells the history of the name and the other of the ingredients.

Everyone has a different theory and everyone is right and wrong.

But whats known for sure it that the margaritas ingredients have been sipped in some form or another for at least a century.

Chantal Martineau, author of How to Gringos Stole Tequila, points out that she found an old cocktail book from 1937 with a recipe for a drink called a picador. It was exactly the same thing as a margarita.

Alcocer says that around the same time, the margarita began to be called by its current name and notes that all of the origin stories of the drink date back to just before the World War Two era.

One popular story attributes its creation to actress Rita Hayworth, who in the 1940s was doing an extended theater engagement in Tijuana.

Related Image Expand / Contract Many believe that the drink was named after Hollywood star Rita Hayworth. (AP)

The actress was evidently somewhat of a barfly and was fond of tequila, says Tad Carducci, one of the authors of The Tippling Brothers: A Lime and a Shaker.

The bartender was fond of the actress and named his concoction after her. Hayworths real name? Margarita Carmen Cansino. Legend has it that when she came back to California she shared the drink and its popularity grew.

But another more plausible story is that the margarita grew out of a popular concoction called The Daisy, typically made with brandy. Theres a tale that another Tijuana bartender in the 1930s swapped the brandy for tequila.

The result was so tasty that the customer ordered another, says Martineau. The drink was christened a tequila daisyand daisy in Spanish is 'margarita.

There is yet another story of a German diplomats daughter named Marguerite who had the drink named after her.

Lacy Hawkins, of Brooklyns Clover Club, says that everyone has a different theory and everyone is right and wrong.

The Margarita Boom

The margaritaas we know it todayearned a place in popular culture by the 1950s when Esquire magazine made it its Drink of the Month.

Tequila sales grew gradually and by the time Jimmy Buffets song Margaritaville came out in 1977, the drink was everywhere.

Related Image Expand / Contract Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville restaurant at The Flamingo on the Las Vegas Strip. Buffet's song about the drink released in 1977 helped make it a lasting part of pop culture. (Margaritaville and the Flamingo Las Vegas)

Soon, the margarita was a mainstay of Tex-Mex restaurants, then spread beyond that to become synonymous with spring break debauchery, Martineau notes.

It is also hard to pinpoint why the margarita went from a simple cocktail to a frozen drink phenomenon.

Hawkins says that the popularity of the margarita coincided with a growth of blended drinks in the 1970s when the U.S. had a technological boom where people could have electronics in their home and bars.

But firmly placing it as Americas most ordered cocktail, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), is the thirst for tequila in the U.S.

DISCUS says that tequila sales went from $962 million in 2003 to $2 billion in 2013.

Reclaiming the True Margarita

A whopping 30 percent of margaritas ordered in restaurants are flavored, according to DISCUS.

And companies continue to capitalize on the popularity of the margarita by creating new variations.

Brands keep releasing alco-pops that trade on that popularity and mixers that are supposed to be the easier or lower calorie way to a margarita. Its not authentic, Martineau says. But its so heavily marketed that its taken on a life of its own. So now, a lot of people think thats what a margarita is.

While this is bad news for the purists who see the only way to drink a margarita is on the rocks with a rim of salt no blender required, Alcocer thinks that these trends are leading to a new evolution of the drink.

It used to be just maybe a party drink or a boozy brunch drink or frozen, but now on top of all those uses now there are mezcal mint and jasmine margaritas. And so that is something that people are starting to experiment with.

Its unclear if it will it still be called a margarita years from now. But for time being, be it on the rocks, frozen or smelling like jasmine-- a drink by any other name would taste as sweet.","['named', 'drink', 'frozen', 'tequila', 'popularity', 'martineau', 'popular', 'thats', 'called', 'margarita']"

Child abuse victims angry that Cardinal George Pell will not return to Australia to testify at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse had requested that they be allowed to hear in person Pell's testimony by video conference, the inquiry's chairman Justice Peter McClellan said.

""The commission considers that to be a reasonable request,"" McClellan said.

A crowd funding website set up last week to raise 55,000 Australian dollars ($39,000) to send 15 abuse victims and their supporters to Rome had raised more than AU$200,000 by Monday. The excess money will be spent on mental health services at Pell's hometown of Ballarat, the website said.

The website said Sunday that the survivors were still awaiting an official announcement from the royal commission on whether they would be allowed to be present when Pell testifies.

Pell, whom the pope placed in charge of the Vatican's finances in 2014, was to testify next Monday for a third time at the royal commission.

The inquiry ruled this month that the 74-year-old cleric could give evidence by video from Rome because he was too ill to fly to Australia.

Pell said in a statement last week that he would cooperate with whatever arrangements the royal commission made for his testimony.

McClellan said a hotel room in central Rome had been selected as the venue for Pell's testimony, but its communications equipment had yet to be tested.

Pell is to give evidence about how church authorities responded to allegations of child sex abuse in Ballarat and in Melbourne, Australia's second-most populous city after Sydney.

He is accused of creating a victims' compensation program mainly to protect the church's assets and of using aggressive tactics to discourage victims' lawsuits, all while he was a bishop in Australia.

His acclaimed namesake restaurant in New York snagged a Michelin star when he was just 29 years old, and in the same year he won the Food Network cooking competition show Next Iron Chef.

But Forgione started his food journey long before that, as a young man while watching his father, acclaimed chef and James Beard Award winner Larry Forgione.

'what can we do with that without messing up, without being dishonest to the process here.'

Following in the footsteps of someone known as ""The Godfather of American Cuisine"" isn't easy, but Marc jumped in as a teenager.

More on this... Kitchen Superstars: Marc Forgione's secret

""When I was 14 or 15 years old,"" Forgione remembers, ""I'd go to my friends houses and we'd go to breakfast and I'd say, Okay, where are your eggs, and they'd look at me like, 'you know how to make eggs?""

From there it was summers spent in the kitchen every year and then after college he worked at restaurants like New Yorks BLT Prime, while also taking time to learn in France and Italy.

""It seems like it happened right away but when I opened my restaurant I was 29 and I had been cooking 'full time' since I was 17. That's 12 years,"" Forgione says of his early rise. ""So I tell young kids all the time its not like you snap your fingers and you have your own restaurant, it was a lot of hard years.""

In fact, he was considering selling his restaurant --and even had meeting lined up with a buyer --but two days before he got his first Michelin star.

Since then Restaurant Marc Forgione has received numerous accolades, and by 2012 Forgione became the youngest American chef to maintain a Michelin star for three consecutive years.

But today he is focused not only on his restaurant, but other New York ventures as well, like his steak restaurant American Cut and the Laotian spot Khe-Yo.

Despite the variety in styles, he says there is a common component that keeps all of the restaurants together.

""I like to describe our style as honest, very respectful of the ingredients and the people that get them to us, and what we do with it. We let the ingredients drive what we're doing and then we think, 'what can we do with that without messing up, without being dishonest to the process here.'""

It is a philosophy of running restaurants based on the ingredients he grew up loving, but with one additional perspective that he has gained over his many years in the business:

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,GOPs Immigration Debate Likely to Ramp Up Ahead of Super Tuesday,['Arian Campo-flores'],"ENLARGE People rally for comprehensive immigration reform outside the White House in Washington on Nov. 7, 2014. Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press

When Rev. John Killian talks to his parishioners and others in Alabama about the presidential race, he says they raise one issue above all: immigration.

I really think thats the red-meat issue right now, said Mr. Killian, pastor of Maytown Baptist Church, near Birmingham, and former chaplain of the Alabama Republican Party. People are very frustrated, unemployment is rising and yet we persist in hiring overseas people.

Immigration, which took center stage in the GOP race Thursday after Pope Francis said GOP candidate Donald Trumps positions on the issue make him not Christian, promises to continue stirring up GOP voters and candidates as the presidential contest barrels toward the March 1 primary states. Concerns about undocumented workers and refugees run deep in a cluster of those states in the South. As a result, Republican presidential contenders likely will continue espousing hard-line positions on immigration matters, potentially hurting the party among Hispanic and Asian voters in the general election.

It is the Republican establishments nightmare. Its mandatory to reach new voters of all ethnic stripes, said Mario H. Lopez, president of the Hispanic Leadership Fund, a conservative advocacy group that seeks to draw more Latinos to the GOP. Any candidate who rejects that is ultimately going to be on the losing side of things.

After GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to President Barack Obama in 2012, a study commissioned by the Republican National Committee faulted the GOP candidates call for self-deportation as a solution to illegal immigration.

That comment and others turned off many Latino and Asian voters, who may not view immigration as a top-of-mind issue but can react viscerally if they perceive immigrants are being attacked. Mr. Romney garnered only 27% of the U.S. Hispanic vote and 26% of the Asian vote.

The RNC study urged the party to back immigration reform and strike a more inclusive tone with minorities. Yet on the campaign trail in the past year, Mr. Trump has said many Mexicans crossing the border are rapists who are bringing drugs and crime into the U.S.; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has ruled out any form of legal status for undocumented immigrants; and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has disowned the immigration-reform bill he helped craft in 2013.

On Thursday on CNN, Mr. Rubio said that he has said hed get rid of President Barack Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy and that he will. I will on my first day in office get rid of it because its unconstitutional, he said.

A November 2015 poll of Hispanic registered voters in 14 battleground states conducted by Latino Decisions, which does work for pro-immigrant groups, found that 69% of respondents said Mr. Trumps comments about immigrants, including his call to deport 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, gave them a very unfavorable view of the Republican Party.

Ahead of the Feb. 20 primary in South Carolina, the candidates have strived to outdo each other in talking tough on immigration, while attacking their rivals as potentially untrustworthy on the issue.

A similar dynamic could play out in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennesseeall part of the so-called SEC primary on March 1. Alabama passed one of the U.S.s strictest laws aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in 2011, parts of which courts later invalidated. Lawmakers at the time said the bill was aimed at making life so difficult for undocumented immigrants that they would leaveand many immigrants did.

Georgia also passed a strict measure in 2011 that authorized police to check the immigration status of some suspects and sought to deter businesses from hiring undocumented workers. Courts later struck down parts of that measure as well.

Some states in the South experienced some of the largest percentage increases of undocumented people in the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s. Those populations soared approximately twelvefold in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee from 1990 to 2009, according to the Pew Research Center. Though the numbers have declined in some states in recent years, alarm over the influx persists among many in the region.

Further inflaming the issue: the recent controversy over plans to allow some Syrian refugees into the U.S., a move some fear could open the way for terrorists to enter the country. Governors in states including Alabama and Texas, which also votes on March 1, have vowed to block refugees admission.

People here are literally scared to death, said Republican state Rep. Mike Holmes of Alabama, a Cruz supporter. Were losing control of our borders.

In previous campaign stops in the South, the GOP candidates have highlighted their stances on immigration. In Mobile, Ala., last year, Mr. Trump welcomed on stage Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican known for his hard-line positions on illegal immigration. In Nashville, Tenn., in December, Mr. Cruz promised to build a secure wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, as did Mr. Trump, and end health-care benefits for undocumented immigrants.

Expect to hear similar pronouncements in the weeks ahead.

According to Bloomberg News, more cruise lines are renting out their commercial ships for private hire.

Of course, anyone could afford the steep price tag would have to a superstar or a billionaireor both.

For example, Windstars 212-passenger Star Breeze cruise liner was rented in 2015 by an unnamed person during the Monaco Grand Prix. Bloomberg reports that a seven-day trip on one of Windstar's 212-passenger Star-class ships could cost ""from $600,000 to $1million.""

Crystal Esprit's private-hire rates start at a slightly lower $500,000 per week.

By comparison, a super yacht rental you could pay $731,000 for the same time frame.

So is there really a market?

Bloomberg notes that this luxury market niche my be spurred on by the super wealthily who feel limited by the number of guests allowed on even the largest of mega-cruise ships, which depending on the type of vessel, can hold between 12 to 36 passengers.

Last year, Hollywood director Steven Spielberg and Russian billionaire Kirill Pisarev both made headlines for ditching their multi-million dollar superyachts because they were too small.

There is an upside for people to rent these larger ships. Believe it not, it may cost the host less per person to invite someone on larger ships, due to the economies of scale.

The downside may be the lack of superior service you get on a private yacht or that some of these larger ships may not be able to anchor in smaller, more intimate spots.

But there's enough of a growth market that it's influencing the design of vessels newly-ordered by many major lines, noted Bloomberg.

Ships such as Crystal's 62-guest Crystal Esprit are made for private charter. Also France's Ponant has added four vessels to its fleet, each with just 132 cabins.

And with the world's most expensive yacht, the Eclipse built by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, valued at a cool $1 billion, the $600,000 rental price seems down right reasonable.","['renting', 'megayachts', 'windstars', 'forget', 'yacht', 'larger', 'ships', 'private', 'vessels', 'cruise', 'vessel', 'billionaires', 'ship', 'super']"

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,"What do Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney share? Both are victims of a left-wing smear machine",['Fred Fleitz'],"This week, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) named my organization, the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a hate group because of our work highlighting the threat from radical Islam. CSP will join other conservative groups such the Family Research Council, Liberty Counsel and WorldNetDaily, all of which SPLC has smeared by listing them alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.

The SPLC is best known for its work decades ago fighting legal battles against segregation in the South. But it long ago morphed into a far left group with one purpose: manufacturing material to slander conservatives for use by the news media and on the Internet.

CSP President Frank Gaffney has been on another SPLC hate list for several years along with American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), Robert Spencer (the founder of director of Jihad Watch blog), Lt. Gen. William Jerry Boykin (executive vice president of the Family Research Council), WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah and other conservatives. Joining them on this list are an assortment of neo-Nazis, KKK members and white supremacists.

Dr. Ben Carson was placed on a SPLC extremist watch list in 2014 because of statements he made in defense of traditional marriage. But after a public outcry, the SPLC was forced to withdraw this designation and issue an apology to Carson in February 2015.

Among the many false claims in the SPLCs new list of hate groups is that Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy have been banned from participating in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and that Gaffneys banishment from CPAC probably earns him points with Trump.

Although CPAC and the Center have had some differences in the past, this is no longer the case. Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC last year and will have an expanded presence in 2016.

I will be speaking at CPAC 2016 conference next month on behalf of the Center on the Iranian and North Korean missile programs.

To show how sloppy the SPLCs research is, a 2015 SPLC report noted that Gaffney and the Center were present at CPACs 2015 conference and that the Center was a sponsor.

As ridiculous as the SPLC hate lists may sound, they often are taken seriously by the liberal media. These lists almost had deadly consequences in 2012 when Floyd Corkins, a volunteer at a gay-rights group, entered the office lobby of the Family Research Council with the intention of killing as many of the Councils employees as possible because of the organizations opposition to same-sex marriage.

Corkins shot and injured a building manager before he was disarmed. He decided to launch a killing spree against the Family Research Council and another conservative organization after he read about their opposition to gay marriage in the SPLCs hate lists.

While SPLC regularly lumps conservatives with neo-nazis and white supremacists for being anti-gay, anti-immigrant, Islamophobes, white nationalists or for miscellaneous hate (such disbelieving in global warming), it refuses to put liberal individuals and groups on their hate lists.

For example, the SPLC had nothing to say last summer when left wing groups like MoveOn.org, the Daily Kos, Credo and the National Iranian American Council attacked Jewish congressmen who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) by questioning their loyalty to this country.

Elliot Abrams decried this bigotry in an August 10, 2015 article in The Weekly Standard:

The basic idea is simple: to oppose the presidents Iran deal means you want war with Iran, youre an Israeli agent, you are in the pay of Jewish donors, and you are abandoning the best interests of the United States. So Dan Pfeiffer, senior political adviser to Obama until this winter, tweeted that Senator Charles Schumerwho announced his opposition to the Iran deal last weekshould not be Democratic leader in the Senate because he wants War with Iran.

SPLC also has been silent on a growing anti-Semitism on the left and how American colleges are ignoring violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States.

On the other hand, the SPLC has joined President Obama in jumping on the fraudulent Islamophobia bandwagon. Thats why CSP and Gaffney caught its attention.

I join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group.

The Islamophobia charges made against CSP and other critics of radical Islam have nothing to do with hate or bigotry  they are a ploy by Mr. Obama, American Muslim groups and liberal groups to sidestep how Islamist extremism represents, as American Islamic Forum for Democracy President Zuhdi Jasser has put it, a problem within the house of Islam.

This problem is the global jihad movement which is an ideology at war not just with modern society but also with the majority of the worlds Muslims.

This is the real hate: Islamic supremacists cloaking their intolerance and hatred towards anyone who rejects their extremism  Muslims and non-Muslims  as protected religious practice. This hate includes brutalizing and killing groups that the SPLC claims to protect: women, LGBT individuals and racial and ethnic minorities.

The SPLC designated Frank Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy as haters because of our work to publicize the threat posed by to the supremacist Islamic shariah doctrine, a threat that President Obama and liberal groups refuse to confront or even name. They are in denial about this threat and instead condemn as bigots anyone who tries to address it.

This was crystal clear when President Obama on February 3 visited a mosque in Baltimore with known terrorist ties but refuses to meet with Muslims like Dr. Jasser who is leading an Islam reform movement that rejects Islamist radicalism and ISIS.

American leftwing groups like SPLC have also stubbornly ignored flagrantly hateful statements by some American Muslim groups.

There was a glaring example of this after the San Bernardino shooting when Hussam Ayloush, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told CNNs New Day, some of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism. ... We are partly responsible.

In May 2004, Ayloush said the U.S. war on terror was a war on Muslims, adding his belief that the 9/11 attacks were committed because of the U.S.s unconditional support of Israel. The U.S. is Israels partner in crime against the Palestinians, Ayloush explained.

How can a supposed civil rights organization like the SPLC give Ayloush and CAIR a pass on such hateful statements and actions?

How can it not speak out against growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States?

One reason is that the SPLC is not a civil rights organization  it is a far left advocacy group that tries to discredit its political enemies on the right with incoherent hate lists that wrongly associate them with notorious bigots to advance a liberal agenda. This is consistent with #12 of Saul Alinskys ""Rules for Radicals"": Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.

SPLC also demonized conservatives with bogus hate charges because it has found this kind of fearmongering to be very lucrative. According to the SPLCs 2014 tax return, this non-profit organization had $54 million in revenue and $315 million in assets.

Back in 2000, an investigative report into the SPLCs activities was published by Harpers Magazine titled The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance. It described the SPLC and its activities as essentially a fraud that shuts down debate, stifles free speech, and most of all, raises a pile of money, very little of which is used on behalf of poor people.

Perhaps the main reason the SPLC has been able to raise such huge sums because its president, Morris Dees, is so skilled at using scare mongering mailings for fund raising that in 1998 he was inducted into the Direct Mailing Association Hall of Fame.

Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.

The author of this article asked, What I'm very curious to learn is how keeping hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in assets, several offshore bank accounts and part ownership in foreign financial firms in any substantive way addresses poverty in America.

I believe the SPLCs new focus on Islamophobia is because the organization has identified attacking critics of radical Islam as the ultimate money pot. For example, Saleh Abdulla Kamel, a Saudi banker believed to have been a financer of Usama bin Laden, gave $10 million to Yale University in 2015 to build an Islamic law center.

Given the SPLCs lack of scruples, greed and offshore operations, I believe it is very likely that this group is receiving funding from Gulf state billionaires like Kamel to discredit anyone who criticizes radical Islam and the global jihad movement.

The news media must stop being manipulated by the SPLCs calumny of its political enemies.

Reporters should realize that an organization which attacks all critics of radical Islam as Islamophobes, refuses to mention the extremism and intolerance of radical Islamist groups, and is silent on the growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish university students cannot be considered a neutral and authoritative source.

The media also needs recognize that the SPLCs hate lists which lump Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney, Cliff Kinkaid and organizations like the Family Resource Council, WorldNet Daily and the Center for Security Policy with neo-Nazis and white supremacists are utter nonsense.

The press should instead be investigating the SPLCs enormous wealth, anonymous funders and how it is poisoning the public debate in this country to advance a liberal agenda and to enrich itself.

Kizza Besigye was arrested as he tried to leave his home where he had been confined under house arrest. Associated Press journalists saw police manhandle him into the back of a blacked-out van and taken away to an undisclosed location.

Besigye had been going to the election commission to get detailed copies of results from presidential election. He has called for an independent audit that includes the international community.

Polly Namaye, a police spokeswoman, said officers arrested Besigye to keep him from ""storming the electoral commission with his supporters.""

Neutral observers had criticized the government for using security forces against opposition candidates and supporters.

The commission announced Saturday that Museveni won the vote with more than 60 percent of counted ballots, while Besigye got 35 percent.

Those results did not include tallies from at least 1,242 polling stations, election commission spokesman Jotham Taremwa told AP on Monday. That's about 4 percent of all polling stations.

Taremwa said the missing results cannot change the outcome, but Besigye's supporters note they could bring down Museveni's margin of victory. Museveni needed 50 percent plus one vote to avoid a runoff election.

The election commission lacks independence and transparency, the European Union observer mission said.

The 71-year-old Museveni seized power in 1986. He is a key U.S. ally on security matters, especially in Somalia.

Besigye was Museveni personal physician during the 1981 to 1986 bush war between Museveni's rebels and forces loyal to former President Milton Obote. He also served as deputy interior minister in his first Cabinet, and broke with the president in 1999, saying he was no longer a democrat.

While I have empathy for victims and the families who have suffered great loss, it is regrettable that the actions of a few terrorists have brought us to think we must decide between personal privacy versus national security.

Social media giants Facebook and Twitter have backed Apple in its dispute with the FBI, as has Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users privacy, he tweeted Wednesday.

1/5 Important post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users privacy  sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016

In a statement posted on Apple's website early Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said the order by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ""has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.""

Related: Legendary iPhone hacker weighs in on Apple's war with the FBI

The ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto shooter Syed Farooks county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature, which erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.

""The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake,"" Cook wrote. ""Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.""

Related: Use the dead to open an iPhone? Apple vs. FBI is getting weird

Michela Menting, digital security research director at ABI Research told FoxNews.com that the creation of a tool bypassing the self-destruct feature could have far-reaching consequences. I think its a dangerous line, and once breached, we are on a slippery slope, she told FoxNews.com, via email. What is to stop other governments from asking the same from Apple?

Requesting Apple to produce such a tool will inevitably result in two things: further requests down the road for providing more backdoors in other tools based on this precedent (including encryption), and, consequently, the slow and inevitable undermining of privacy as we know it today, added Menting. It may also mean that the U.S. tech industry moves abroad to more favorable governments (maybe Israel or Switzerland).

Related: Does Apple even have the ability to hack the iPhone like the FBI wants?

Americas tech titans have already voiced their concern about creating so-called backdoors into encrypted devices for government. In the wake of the Paris terror attacks last November, the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which includes Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter, rejected calls for weakened encryption.

Apple has been granted a three-day extension to Feb. 26 to respond to the court order to help unlock Farooks iPhone 5c.

A study out of Brigham Young University suggests obese people who undergo a certain kind of weight loss operation after age 35 may live longer than obese people of the same age who dont have the surgery.

The study reports that the gastric bypass operation is associated with a mortality benefit along with its better-known metabolic benefits. The data collected showed patients ages 35 to 44 were 46% less likely to die from any cause over the next seven years than those who didnt undergo surgery.

In this procedure, surgeons reduce the size of the stomach and reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract so that food will bypass part of the intestines as its being digested.

Others say the study results should be interpreted with caution, as bariatric surgeons exclude high risk patients from surgery so the obese people who had the surgery were a relatively healthy group to start with.

48-percent said the pope should keep his views on immigration to himself.

In the same poll, a whopping 76-percent of Catholic Republicans said they favored building a wall across the Mexican border, and 61-percent of those Catholic Republicans approved of trump's immigration plan.

Yes those polls were before the recent exchange of comments -- but based on those numbers, one could assume any kind of dust up with the Pope on immigration will turn out to be a good -- not a bad thing -- for Trump.

foxnews,2016-01-26 00:00:00,Sexy signal? Frill and horns may have helped dinosaur communicate,[],"The fancy frill and cheek horns that adorned the head of a triceratops relative may have helped the dinosaur communicate, possibly acting as a social or sexy signal, a new study suggests.

This isn't the first time researchers have analyzed the skull of Protoceratops andrewsi, a sheep-size dinosaur with four legs that dates to the Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. Protoceratops andrewsi lived just before Triceratops, and paleontologists regularly come across their fossilized remains in Mongolia.

As researchers collected more specimens over the years, they noticed a peculiar pattern: The frill was absent in juveniles, but it quickly grew disproportionately larger in relation to the dinosaur's size in adulthood. [Tiny & Old: Images of 'Triceratops' Ancestors]

This sudden burst in frill growth suggests that 6.5-foot-long P. andrewsi used the structure as a signal, possible to convey its dominance and age, and maybe even serve as a sexual sign, the researchers said.

""Paleontologistshave long suspected that many of the strange features we see in dinosaurs were linked to sexual display and social dominance, but this is very hard to show,"" study lead author David Hone, a lecturer of zoology at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said in a statement. ""The growth pattern we see in Protoceratops matches that seen for signaling structures in numerous different living species and forms a coherent pattern from very young animals right through to large adults.""

To investigate, the researchers measured how the frill changed in length and width in 37 dinosaurs over four life stages, including hatchling babies, young animals, near-adults and adults. The frill changed in size, as well as shape, becoming proportionally wider as the dinosaur grew up, they noted.

The dinosaur's cheek horns also grew larger with age, but they did not grow as much as the frills, according to the study. This finding suggests that P. andrewsiused its cheek horns for signaling as well, but more evidence is needed to confirm that idea.

""Biologists are increasingly realizing that sexual selection is a massively important force in shaping biodiversity both now and in the past,"" said study co-author Rob Knell, a professor of evolutionary ecology at QMUL.

""Not only does sexual selection account for most of the stranger, prettier and more impressive features that we see in the animal kingdom, [but] it also seems to play a part in determining how new species arise,"" Knell said. ""And there is increasing evidence that it also has effects on extinction rates and on the ways by which animals are able to adapt to changing environments.""

The study raises some interesting and compelling interpretations of P. andrewsi's frills and cheek horns, said Andrew Farke, a paleontologist at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, California, who was not involved in the new research.

""I would suspect that there is some sort of role in reproduction for this, if it's the adults that are showing the biggest size of this, it makes sense,"" Farke told Live Science. ""On the other hand, it's also likely that it could just be for how old are you relative to the next animal, so who gets to the food first?""

The study was published online Jan. 13 in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Weighing in at 70 pounds, Kong was just too much octopus for his female counterparts, who weighed 30 to 40 pounds. ""Theres a chance he would see her as food,"" the aquarium's Tom Carpenter tells Crosscut.

It could be that Kong dodged a bullet: Octopi are ""terminal breeders,"" meaning that both males and females of the species die shortly after mating. So instead, the aquarium let visitors watch Kong swim around with a diver on Valentine's Day, and later planned to return him to Puget Sound.

In any event, there's no telling what would have happened had the show been allowed to go on. ""A blind date is a blind date,"" Carpenter says, ""and you never know how it's going to go."" Lovemaking itself can be dangerous for the males, too.

Researchers in Indonesia have observed a female octopus basically strangle her mate during coitus and drag him to her den to eat him. (On the other hand, this little octopus is a romantic.)

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,Comcast Data Cap: The ISP Wants You to Pay for Netflix Binges,[],"If you like to think of subscription services like Netflix as an all-you-can-eat buffet of streaming videos, some Internet service providers want to put you on a crash diet.

To tame your appetite for nonstop streaming and Netflix binges, a number of companies are imposing or testing broadband data capsalso called ""usage-based pricing""that limit the amount of streaming you can do without having to pay extra. Comcast is the largest company applying these caps, and it recently expanded its tests to 10 states, and several large cities, including Atlanta, Miami, and Nashville. On its website, the company says that if you use more than the 300GB allotted each month and want to continue streaming, you'll have to buy additional 50GB blocks at $10 each. The company also has an ""unlimited"" data option in some markets that costs an extra $30 to $35 each month.

There's one major exception to those caps: Comcast isn't counting programming from its own Stream TV when calculating how much data you use. We think you'll hear more about this practice, called zero rating, over the next few months. It's fairly common among cell phone carriers: T-Mobile's Binge On and Verizon's Go90 mobile video services are both exempt from those carriers data caps.

At first, zero rating might seem like a good deal for consumersafter all, you get to watch movies without having to pay for the extra data you use. However, groups including Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, arent so sure, as it provides an incentive for you to choose a broadband provider's own service rather than a competitor's, which seems unfair. Zero rating isn't banned by the FCC's Open Internet rules, but it seems to dance close to the line. While the practice isn't explicitly prohibited, the FCC has said it will evaluate such business practices on a case-by-case basis.

Other companies testing or broadly imposing data caps include AT&T, CenturyLink, Cox, and Suddenlink; surcharges kick in after you've used 150GB per month (for those with slower DSL connections) to 250GB or 300GB (faster connections).

Will You Hit Your Cap?

Comcast argues that fewer than 10 percent of its customers will ever reach a broadband cap under normal usage. The company also has a three-month courtesy plan, so that you only get charged extra for any overages when you exceed your cap for the fourth month.

But here's why Comcast data caps could be a concern for many families. Netflix says that streaming a high-def movie can eat up close to 5GB per hour, so you'd have to burn through 50 hours of movies25 two-hour moviesor 50 one-hour TV shows, to hit a 250GB monthly cap. Admittedly, few of us watch that much streamingby ourselves. But those numbers start to look far more modest when you consider a household with a few children and multiple devicessmart TVs, streaming players, game consoles, Blu-ray players, tablets, smartphonesall connected to the Internet via the home's Wi-Fi network. In households where several members like to watch several episodes, or even whole seasons, of a show in binges, data usage grow quickly.

And in the near future, it's likely we'll all be using more, not less data, as more of our entertainment migrates to the Web, and the Internet of Things adds connectivity to all sorts of deviceseverything from thermostats to smart refrigerators.

We expect to see streaming services add more higher-bandwidth 4K videoswith four times as many pixels as HD streamsto their mix, some with high dynamic range and wider color gamuts. Even with more efficient video encoding, these enhancements to video picture quality will eat up more data than regular HD streams. And analysts at market-research firms expect more ISPs to try usage-based pricing to compensate for the loss of subscribers to traditional TV services who switch to Internet-based alternatives.

Not surprisingly, data caps have become a hot-button issue with consumers who now have to live with them. A Freedom of Information Act request, filed by the CutCableToday website, revealed that the FCC received 13,000 formal complaints from Comcast customers protesting the practice. Time Warner Cable experimented with usage-based pricing as an option, but abandoned the practice after it was poorly received.

Charter, currently looking for regulatory approval to merge with Time Warner Cable, has pledged to refrain from usage-based fees, at least for the next three years. Neither Verizon nor Bright House, which is also being acquired by Charter, has data caps, and both have said they won't impose them in the near future.

Consumer Reports and Consumers Union have pointed out how broadband data caps could discourage the use of the Internet for a variety of worthwhile activities, including education and small-business innovation.

If you have a broadband plan that is subject to a data cap, let us know in the comments below; tell us whether you regularly exceed your monthly data allotment.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Barcelona's penalty woes unlikely to halt title march,[],"One thing they apparently don't teach too well in the best finishing school of the world's favourite sport, the elite bracket of Spain's La Liga, is how to take a penalty. Ask Lionel Messi. He has scored more than 300 league goals for Barcelona -- he reached that landmark with two in Wednesday's win over Sporting Gijon -- and an extraordinary proportion of them have been brilliant, unique, innovative and breathtakingly executed strikes. But he'd have 308 Liga goals to his name by now if he'd only been a little better at the simple act of directing a shot on target, with a dead ball, past a goalkeeper and no defenders from 12 yards.

In all his career, Messi has converted 66 successful penalties. And there have 18, for club and country, where he failed to score. It is a startlingly imperfect ratio for the most gifted footballer of his epoch. Last weekend, he applied his ingenuity and imagination to challenge one of the sport's most established orthodoxies, which is that a penalty necessarily means a shot at goal. He passed the ball, which is legal but very, very rare, after having been awarded, and then designated to take, a spot-kick. He invited Luis Suarez, the nearest colleague, to score from the pass he rolled to his right from the penalty spot on the way to a 6-1 thrashing of Celta Vigo.

Suarez re-established his spot as La Liga's leading scorer for the season so far with that goal, so it was a generous, collegiate gesture by Messi, even if Neymar, who has led the list of top-scorers in Spain for some of the campaign, later claimed, with no rancour, it was he who had been the intended beneficiary of Messi's unconventional gesture with the penalty. The indirect penalty made a big story, for its rarity; it also added, by accident, to the statistics that say Messi is not very good at them. Including the pass from the spot against Celta, Messi has now not scored from five of the last 12 penalties he has taken.

Perhaps Barca ought to consider having a new chief penalty-taker. Trouble is, other candidates are wanting in that area too. Suarez, given a rare stab at penalty duty, could not convert the one Barcelona were awarded last week against Sporting, where the visitors won 3-1. Neymar has scored six penalties in his Barcelona career; he's also failed from the spot four times. It's almost as if the simpler, static opportunity to beat a goalkeeper with most of the odds in your favor is too vulgar for Messi, Neymar and Suarez, a trio of otherwise outstanding finishers.

In terms of the destination of the Liga title, Barcelona's missed penalties are barely relevant, a small pimple on the face of a supermodel. They seldom cost points and the men who fail from 12 yards out with a stationary ball have a habit of putting their names on the scoresheet within 90 minutes of that setback. Suarez scored Barcelona's opening goal, to take his tally for the Liga season to 25 in the sixth minute of the 2-1 victory at Las Palmas on matchday 25, three days after the trip to Gijon, while Neymar added the second after the Canary Islanders had drawn level. Barcelona had it tough for much of the afternoon, and betrayed some signs of having their minds on Tuesday's Champions League last-16 first leg away at Arsenal.

When they set off for London on Monday, though, they cannot help but feel happy. Events elsewhere pushed them closer to the successful defense of their domestic title and very ready to thank whatever Iberian virus is toying with the ability of the world's finest goalscorers to fulfil the task of propelling a ball past a goalkeeper from 12 yards out. On Sunday, the virus struck again: Cristiano Ronaldo messed up a penalty for Real Madrid, at Malaga, and it cost his team points.

Ronaldo had looked annoyed earlier in the week, when he undertook media duties for Madrid in Italy ahead of the Champions League meeting with Roma, and defended his recent record of low scoring -- low scoring by his elevated standards, that is -- in away matches. ""Name one player who has scored more away goals than me since I came to Spain,"" he challenged reporters. ""No answer? Ok."" At which point he left the press conference. Next night he scored his 12th away goal of the season to usher Madrid to a 2-0 win.

On Sunday he then scored his 13th away goal, across competitions, of the season, to give Madrid the lead against Malaga. So far, so Cristiano: Defiant, belligerent. But 10 minutes before half-time, he had a chance, via a penalty, to put Madrid clear at 2-0 up. But his spot-kick was directed too close to Carlos Kameni, the Malaga goalkeeper. Kameni was on good form all afternoon, and was hardly troubled by the short step and dive to his left that he needed to stop Ronaldo's shot.

That was the 99th penalty of Ronaldo's career. He tends to be better at them than Messi, his great rival: this was only his 13th failed spot-kick. But the failure hurt. As a result of the 1-1 draw at Malaga, Ronaldo's Madrid now trail Messi's Barcelona by nine points, not seven, in the table. Atletico Madrid, in second place, have also slipped further behind the leaders, eight points back, after a tight, 0-0 draw with fourth-placed Villarreal, a game of few chances and no penalties, scored or missed. Next weekend, Atletico go across town to Real. It's a Madrid derby that now looks more like a contest for Spain's silver medal, as Barca edge closer to the gold.","['scored', 'halt', 'woes', 'title', 'messi', 'madrid', 'penalties', 'barcelonas', 'barcelona', 'penalty', 'unlikely', 'suarez', 'spot', 'away', 'goal']"
foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,How to avoiding costly airline change fees,[],"Airlines now get one-fourth of their revenue from fees, and one of the biggest is a charge of up to $200 to change or cancel a ticket.

The fee galls consumers who find themselves with an unexpected need to change their travel plans. In some cases, the fee is more than the price they paid for the ticket.

When all the receipts are counted, it is likely that consumers paid the airlines more than $3 billion in fees to cancel or change a flight in 2015. That is triple what they paid in change fees in 2007.

Avoiding these hefty fees will take a bit of planning before you book your flight. Once you pay for the ticket, you're at the mercy of the airline. Experts have some tips:

GRACE PERIOD

If your flight is at least seven days away, federal regulations require airlines to give passengers 24 hours to change their mind at no cost.

Airlines can let passengers hold a reservation at the quoted price for 24 hours before paying, as American Airlines does, or let them cancel without penalty for 24 hours, as most other carriers do.

EXCEPTION AIRLINES

Southwest Airlines doesn't charge change fees. If you cancel at least 10 minutes before the flight you can use the ticket's value for another flight, but you could owe more money if the new flight has a higher fare.

Alaska Airlines lets passengers change or cancel for no fee if the flight is at least 60 days away.

TICKET TYPES

Refundable tickets cost more  sometimes substantially more  but they might pay off if you have any doubts about your ability to make the trip.

Also, some airlines offer bundled fares that include a free ticket change. ""The Works"" from Frontier Airlines costs more than a basic ticket, but includes a free change. You also get free bags and priority boarding. And it is refundable.

""Refundability is better than (a free) change because you get to say, 'I don't want to go.'"" says George Hobica, founder of airfarewatchdog.com.

Some experienced fliers suggest that you buy two one-way tickets if you can replace either one for less than the change fee on a round-trip ticket. Here's why:

Most airlines now sell one-way tickets for half the price of a round trip. Adam Goldstein, the co-founder and CEO of Hipmunk, a travel site-comparison firm, says he recently did this for a San Francisco-Los Angeles round trip. When he needed to change the first leg, he threw away his $80 ticket but was able to buy another for about the same price instead of paying the higher change fee.

TIME YOUR PURCHASE

If you book your flight many months in advance there is a greater chance that a crisis at work or an illness could cause you to miss the trip. Goldstein says you should book ahead of time because fares do rise closer to the flight, ""but wait until you are as confident as possible that you're actually going to make the trip.""

WING IT

Finally, ""You hope and pray your flight is severely delayed or canceled,"" Hobica says, because you are entitled to a refund if the airline can't honor your ticket. He says you should demand a refund even if the flight's schedule has changed significantly  if the departure time changes by several hours or a nonstop becomes a one-stop.

There are also outfits that will help travelers avoid hefty change fees by locking in a fare for several days without buying the ticket. It is like buying an option  you can walk away if your plans change, and it protects you from a sharp rise in the fare.

A start-up called Flyr lets you lock in a fare for up to seven days for a fee of $5 to $35 depending on the flight without buying the ticket, says the firm's product manager, Andrew Jing. There are limits to its service  American Airlines doesn't allow its fares to be displayed on Flyr or a similar service offered on Hipmunk. Some airlines including United offer their own versions of locking in a quoted fare for a fee.

U.S. airlines raised $2.98 billion from change fees in 2014, the latest full year for which government figures are available. Through the first nine months of 2015, revenue from the fee was up more than 2 percent, putting the airlines on a path toward raising about $3.05 billion from the charge in all of 2015. That's up from $915 million in 2007, and as extra charges on airline travelers go it is second only to baggage fees.","['tickets', 'fee', 'costly', 'avoiding', 'price', 'airlines', 'hours', 'airline', 'fees', 'cancel', 'flight', 'ticket', 'change']"

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Samsung's Galaxy S7 gets bigger battery, roomier display, while LG innovates with G5",['Brooke Crothers'],"Samsung has updated its flagship phones with under-the-hood changes and a bigger screen, while LG has made more radical changes to its most popular phone series.

The Korean electronics giant rolled out the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Sunday at Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. Both models mark the next generation of Samsungs most popular smartphones and the next stage in its fierce rivalry with Apple.



Galaxy S7 edge: Samsung surprised with the new version of the curved-screen model by bumping up the display size to 5.5 inches from 5.1 inches. (The previous-generation Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones had both been 5.1 inches.) The display retains the same quad HD resolution as the previous generation and the same curved design that waterfalls on both sides. Samsung also tweaked the back of the phone, giving it a very slight curve to make it easier to hold.

Related: Windows 10 vs OS X

Its worth noting that with the bigger 5.5-inch display, the S7 edge is now on equal footing with the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, Apples largest smartphone.



The biggest under-the-hood change for the S7 edge is the battery, which has been increased to 3,600 mAh from 2,600. Thats a big boost and should help Samsung address the battery-life shortcomings of the S6 edge.



Galaxy S7: The 5.1-inch flat-screen S7 saw the fewest cosmetic changes. Like the S7 edge, it gets a curvier back for better ergonomics. And like the S7 edge, it also gets a bigger battery, now 3,000 mAh, up from 2,550 mAh in the S6. A bigger battery invariably makes a device heavier but thats a tradeoff Samsung is willing to make to improve battery life.



Related: New 4-inch iPhone and 'iPad Air 3' get March release date, report says

Common specs to the Galaxy S7 edge and Galaxy S7: The biggest spec change common to both phones is the camera. Though seemingly counterintuitive, Samsung actually dropped the megapixel count to 12MP in the Galaxy S7 from 16MP in the S6. But less can be more in the case of camera sensors. The pixels are now bigger and Samsung claims the larger pixels let in more light, resulting in better low-light photos. And Samsung has improved the lens too to allow more light through.



Both devices are water and dust resistant and both get Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the latest Android operating system.



The phones will be available from U.S. carriers on March 11. Pricing should be similar to the previous-generation S6 edge and S6, Samsung said.

Related: iPhone 7 rumored to wow with killer camera, reports say

LG G5: Though invariably overshadowed by Samsung, the smaller South Korean phone maker made more radical changes with the new G5 phone.



The killer feature of the slightly smaller phone (compared to the G4) is modularity. By pressing a button, the bottom of the phone slides out, which allows you to not only swap out the battery for a fresh one but add upgrade modules too. For example, there's a module for upgrading the audio and another one that adds features to the camera like better zoom and a bigger battery.



And speaking of the camera. The LG G5 has both 8- and 16-megapixel sensors on the back, located on either side of the LED flash. The secondary 8MP sensor allows wide-angle shots, according to LG.

The all-metal G5 also has some of the more expected tweaks like a faster processor and ships with Android Marshmallow.

The states Senate Education Committee voted 6-3 against SB 16-105. The no votes included two Republican members of the committee who originally signed on as co-sponsors  Sen. Vicki Marble, R-Fort Marble, and Sen. Laura Woods, R-Thornton.

SB 16-105 would have shed a requirement that half of a teachers evaluation be determined by student improvement on standardized tests, but districts could use test scores to count for up to 20 percent of each teachers evaluation.

Colorado switched to Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers tests in 2015, now taken by all public school students, including charter school pupils. No state testing growth data is being used to evaluate teachers this year because of the change. Instead, districts are using locally chosen measures.

The legislations primary sponsor  Sen. Mike Merrifield, D-Colorado Springs  introduced a similar bill last year, but it also never got out of the Senate Education Committee. A retired music teacher, Merrifield served four terms in the Colorado House, including chairing the House Education Committee.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that pioneers tech for the US military, created the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program. Oregon-based company Leidos is working with the agency to develop the groundbreaking ship.

On Tuesday DARPA tweeted a picture of ACTUV being prepared for sea trials in the spring.

From concept: https://t.co/A2buvNq9DP to prototype -- this is ACTUV today, being prepped for sea trials this spring. pic.twitter.com/CsNQYmVl6S  DARPA (@DARPA) February 16, 2016

Without a human crew, this drone vessel will be able to execute important missions independently like tracking and trailing an enemy sub over thousands of miles  not just for a day or two, or even a few weeks  this drone could hunt the enemy for months.

Related: Drone swarms join the Navy

The ACTUV enemy submarine hunter is expected to be about 130 feet long. DARPA has announced that it will be revealed for the first time on April 7 when it will also be christened in Portland, Oregon.

In addition to hunting enemy subs, ACTUV will be capable of a wide range of missions, such as reconnaissance and counter-mine deployments. It could also be useful to resupply troops.

Whats the threat?

The rise of tough-to-detect and track diesel electric submarines poses a significant challenge to the U.S. Navy. ACTUV is designed to excel at tracking these ultra-quiet subs.

Diesel-electric submarines come at a relatively cheap price point of about $250 million, while giving their owners the advantage of stealthy movements beneath the surface due to their virtually silent engines.

Related: Historic aircraft carriers in pictures

How quiet is quiet? Reports suggest that some of these subs can be 15 decibels more quiet than a humpback whale.

Iran claims to have fleets of these sneaky subs.

How ACTUV will be a game changer

Enter ACTUV, which could roam the oceans for thousands and thousands of miles executing missions.

For next level tracking, the vessel will be armed with state-of-the art sensors allowing it to detect the quietest of enemy subs. The idea is that it will be nearly impossible for a hostile sub to slip the ACTUV when the unmanned vessel is on its tail.

Related: Israeli company Elbit Systems showcases robot warship

Despite being smaller than traditional subs, the ACTUV will be able to achieve speeds that exceed diesel electric propulsion submarines - and for a fraction of the cost.

ACTUV will have logic that allows it to not just identify other vessels, but also predict how they will behave. The sub hunter will be so smart that it should be able to interact, counter and outmaneuver manned enemy vessels.

It will be able to run operations as part of a team with other unmanned vessels operating beneath the water and on the surface. The sub hunter could also work in cooperation with manned vessels.

And get this  ACTUV is designed to figure out and comply with maritime laws, such as regulations to prevent collisions.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

When ACTUV enters service, it will give the U.S. military a range of advantages. Rather than send out a destroyer or a nuclear sub, ACTUV could be deployed, freeing up those assets and keeping costs down.

ACTUV will offer lots of versatility, such as launching from and returning to a pier  rather than having to deploy from a ship like other UUVs (Unmanned Underwater Vehicles). ACTUV will also give the Navy a vessel with far better endurance. It will also be able to carry far more weight than lots of the drone surface vessels launched from ships.

Whats Next?

After the big reveal in April, ACTUV will continue to be tested and refined.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Research on link between Zika and birth defects expected by May,[],"Two U.S.-Brazilian studies will have initial results by May on whether the Zika virus spreading through the Americas is causing birth defects and other neurological disorders, a senior U.S. public health official said on Friday.

The studies seek to confirm that the mosquito-borne virus is responsible for an unprecedented surge in Brazil of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly, and that it can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a temporary paralysis in adults.

Since it appeared in Brazil last year, the virus has spread to at least 32 countries and territories, mostly in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Zika had previously been viewed as a relatively mild illness, but concern over the possible link to birth defects prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1.

The CDC will monitor 100 babies with microcephaly and their mothers in Brazil and compare them with healthy babies to determine whether Zika caused the brain defects during the early months of pregnancy. Another CDC study underway in Brazil is looking at whether there is a link between Zika and Guillain-Barre.

Results are expected this spring, said CDC principal deputy director Anne Schuchat.

""Scientists are increasingly confident that Zika is causing microcephaly, but people may have different judgments about how much proof is enough,"" Schuchat told reporters during a two-day meeting in the Brazilian capital on how to deal with the virus, which is borne by the same mosquito that transmits dengue and yellow fever.

""The epidemiologic studies ongoing here in Brazil and some being initiated in Colombia should help cement the link,"" she said.

Researchers are closely watching Colombia, the country with the most Zika cases after Brazil, but no microcephaly cases.

Pregnant women in Colombia confirmed as being infected by the Zika virus will deliver babies in coming months, which is an opportunity for gathering further evidence, Dr. Bruce Aylward of the WHO said.

The WHO said on Friday it could take four to six months to prove the link.

""This does not still prove causation... but it is an increasing accumulation of evidence,"" Aylward told a news briefing. ""We are seeing a lack of other explanatory causes.""

Brazil has said it has confirmed more than 500 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 3,900 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.

Brazil is scrambling to contain the Zika outbreak that threatens attendance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August. The United States and other countries are recommending that pregnant women stay away.

While he would later become famous for blurring the lines of composition and perception, the artist lived amid this traditional home's clean lines.

Now on the market for $900,000, the cute and tidy four-bedroom home was built in 1908, and housed Jackson, his parents, and four older brothers from 1917 to 1920. It's located on an 18.5-acre lot that backs up to Big Chico Creek. The property includes a perfect little one-bedroom studio apartment in the backyard (perhaps a painter's studio for the next Pollock?).

The main house has light-filled rooms, some of which look out onto the property's orchard. Two of its three bedrooms are on the renovated second floor. Its front porch and landscaped backyard with a patio are cozy spots to chill.

Recent interior updates include refinished red-fir floors and fresh paint on the walls. Outside, a new sprinkler system, new sod, new concrete sidewalks, and new wrought-iron fencing have been installed.

Side note: The current owners, who have been operating the property as a rental -- charging $2,500 a month for the home and the studio -- are willing to lease out the 17-acre orchard of Chandler walnuts, a leading commercial variety.","['lived', 'jackson', 'orchard', 'pollocks', 'wroughtiron', 'sale', 'chico', 'paint', 'willing', 'studio', 'backyard', 'art', 'property', 'childhood', 'history']"

Lets break this down.

The government is seeking access to one phone as part of an ongoing terrorist investigation which took the lives of 14 Americans on our own soil and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook is refusing to cooperate because it will, according to his February 16th letter to customers, create a bad precedent by comprising encryption and ultimately privacy.

Really? Are you kidding me? At what point do we draw the line in the sand and say that corporate America has an obligation to the safety and security of the American public and it supersedes the desires of corporate leaders to pad their balance sheets. Make no mistake about it. This is not about Apples inability to create a myopically focused back door to this very device especially given the fact it employs some of the greatest mathematical minds in the world. What this is about is the need to garner evidence, expeditiously, to ascertain who the two terrorists were communicating with so as to crystalize coconspirators on the San Bernardino attack, as well as other similar occurrences currently in the planning stages.

That said, the only thing that is preventing Apple from complying is the monster-sized ego of one man who wants the world to think he is just a good guy looking out for the common good and the privacy of his customers. I wonder if he will bring that speech to the pulpit after the next attack especially if we were to verify it could have been prevented, had he cooperated.

Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush suspended his campaign for the White House on Saturday, following a poor showing in the South Carolina primaries.

Im proud of the campaign that we have run to unify our country, Bush said. But the people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision. So tonight I am suspending my campaign.

Bush, the former Florida governor, entered the 2016 presidential race as an early favorite, but has fallen in the polls steadily, despite having had a couple strong debate performances in recent weeks.

The presidency is bigger than any one person, Bush said during an emotional speech. It is certainly bigger than any candidate.","['tonight', 'unify', 'campaign', 'jeb', 'bush', 'weeksthe', 'bigger', 'suspends', 'white', 'south', 'presidential', 'carolina']"

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Trump is GOP delegate leader after S.C. win; Rubio edges Cruz,[],"Yes, Donald Trump could really be the Republican nominee.

The blunt-talking billionaire posted his second straight victory in South Carolina's Republican primary Saturday, ending any lingering doubts that he could transform his passionate supporters into voters. On the other side of the country, Hillary Clinton blunted concerns about her viability with a clear victory over Bernie Sanders in Nevada, the first state to test the Democrats' appeal among a racially diverse group of voters.

Trump, now the clear leader in the delegate race, cemented his standing as his party's favorite. No Republican in modern times has won New Hampshire and South Carolina and then failed to win the nomination. Having proven his mettle in South Carolina, Trump emerged well-primed for more winning as the primary heads toward a cluster of Southern states.

""It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious,"" Trump said of the rollicking presidential campaign. ""It's beautiful. When you win, it's beautiful.""

Though Trump's victory was vindication for political mavericks whose hunger for an outsider has defined this year's campaign, those fortunes didn't extend to Sanders. After winning the second contest in New Hampshire, the self-declared democratic socialist came up in short in Nevada, where Clinton collected the majority of delegates and told gleeful supporters that ""this one is for you.""

For Jeb Bush, it was the end of the line. His donors ready to bolt, the political scion dropped out of the race after failing to break into the top three.

Trump routed his rivals by capturing roughly one-third of the votes in South Carolina. Sen. Marco Rubio edged fellow freshman Sen. Ted Cruz for second place, according to complete but unofficial results. John Kasich shrugged off a weak performance in South Carolina, a conservative state the Ohio governor had largely written off.

From here, Republicans and Democrats swap places, with the GOP candidates preparing to face off Tuesday in Nevada and the Democrats four days later in South Carolina. The bigger prize comes a few days later, when a dozen states vote on March 1, with oodles of delegates up for grabs.

A string of victories for Clinton and Trump in those Super Tuesday contests would give them commanding leads in the delegate race, dampening prospects for their rivals to catch up. Already, Trump leads Republicans with 61 of the needed 1,237 delegates, while Clinton has 503 to Sanders' 70, including superdelegates who back the candidate of their choice.

When Trump jumped into the race eight months ago, most Republican leaders dismissed the real estate mogul, insisting the die-hards packing his amped-up rallies were fans, not real voters. Not anymore.

The biggest question facing Republicans now is whether those seeking to spoil a Trump nomination have simply run out of time. Both Cruz and Rubio hinted at their strategy for knocking him out as they addressed supporters after polls closed.

""We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump,"" said Cruz, the victor of the Iowa caucuses. ""If you are a conservative, this is where you belong because only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race.""

Rubio, the fresh-faced son of Cuban immigrants, has insisted he's the only Republican that can best Clinton or another Democrat with a voting public that's growing younger and more diverse. Having finally dispensed with Bush, he confidently told supporters in Columbia that ""this has become a three-person race.""

""This country is now ready for a new generation of conservatives to guide us into the 21st century,"" Rubio said, flanked by South Carolina's Indian-American Gov. Nikki Haley and African-American Sen. Tim Scott.

Clinton's victory was a relief for her campaign following her blowout loss in New Hampshire. She captured voters who said electability and experience were important to their vote, according to entrance polls Edison Research conducted for The Associated Press and TV networks. But in sign of Clinton's continuing vulnerability, Sanders did best with voters seeking someone caring and honest.

""We have come a very long way in nine months,"" Sanders said. He waxed optimistic that ""the wind is at our backs.""

Backed by a powerful network of small-dollar donors, Sanders has plenty of funds to stay in for months. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson vowed to keep campaigning despite lagging far behind his fellow Republicans.

We got this question from a viewer:

Dear Dr. Manny,

My 6-month-old daughter who is usually a great sleeper has been waking up several times a night crying and is just generally cranky all of a sudden. I think she is teething. What can I do to help soother her discomfort?

Thanks,

Tara

Do you have health questions? If you have health questions just email Dr. Manny: drmanny@foxnews.com

Well, Tara, you may be right. Most babies start teething between four and seven months. Signs can include:

- Excessive drooling

- Chewing on solid objects

- Irritability or crankiness

- Tender, swollen gums

- Night waking

- Ear pulling

Its important you keep a close eye on your baby because some of the signs of teething can actually be symptoms of illness.

But, if she is about to cut her first tooth, there are things you can do to help ease the pain:

- Offer teething toys or a clean, wet washcloth to provide counterpressure on the gums.

- Rub babys gums using a clean finger or moistened gauze.

- Try giving her cold water in a bottle or cold food in a mesh feeder is shes six months or older.

- Dry off excess drool that can cause skin irritation.

- If all else fails, you can try giving her acetaminophen, but only after youve talked to her doctor.

Avoid using any numbing agents which have been shown to put children under the age of 2 at risk for reduced oxygen in the blood and always talk to your childs doctor before trying any home remedies.","['try', 'months', 'questions', 'night', 'relieve', 'waking', 'gums', 'discomfort', 'teething', 'signs', 'using', 'tips', 'help']"

Story Continued Below

The moment was significant, looking to observers like an anointment, a conferring of almost fatherly approval, a permanent linking of political lives. But today this long-term, now-strained relationship is hurtling toward a high-stakes climax. Saturdays Republican primary in South Carolina is shaping up to be the death of the presidential candidacy of Bush. The collapse of the campaign has something to do with the yoke of the Bush family history and a historically tumultuous, unforeseeable racebut the failure is particularly painful because it comes also at the hands of Rubio, the Cuban-American up-and-comer in whom Bush once identified potential and invested political capital.

It is widely believed that Bush and Rubio are mentor and protege, a tie even approaching familial. Based, though, on dozens of interviews with people who know them wellcolleagues and contemporaries in Florida politics, many of whom consider both men friends, almost all of whom over this past contentious year have had to pick sidesthat is a simplistic, incomplete and flawed characterization of the true nature of the relationship, which is less close and more transactional than previously reported. Perhaps no one misunderstood this more than Bush himself, and that misunderstanding is at the root of the anger and sense of betrayal that Bush, his staffers and his army of loyalists feel toward Rubio, from whom they had expected more deference.

The truth is, said Dan Gelber, the minority leader of the state house of representatives when Rubio was the speaker and Bush was the governor, Jeb wasnt a father figure, and Marco was going to be a star notwithstanding Jebs support.

It wasnt brothers, and it wasnt close friends, said a Bush backer wholike many Bush backershas a history with Rubio as well.

Its definitely not father-son, said Ralph Arza, one of Rubios best friends. I never saw or witnessed this mentor-mentee relationship.

These guys werent social buddies, another Bush supporter said. These guys were political friends.

In September 2005, Marco Rubio inherited a sword presented to him by then-Governor Jeb Bush, right, christening Rubio as the incoming Florida speaker of the House. Said one legislator in attendance during the ceremony: He was immediately tagged as a guy who was going places. | Phil Coale

I dont doubt that Marco Rubio respected Jeb Bush as a leader, but I dont suspect that he viewed that relationship nearly as personally as Bush and Bush people did, said Steve Schale, a Florida Democratic strategist who directed Barack Obamas campaign in the state in 2008. Marco got out of the relationship what he needed.

Less Shakespearean psychodrama, more a blind spot or a basic error in political math: There, back in 2005, it turns out, was Bushs first mistake in the failure of his White House bid of 2016. Recast, the sword ceremony that fall no longer looks like a gift exchange or a symbolic gesture. It looks like a transfer of power. It looks like the beginning of the end for Bush, and the end of the beginning for Rubio. There were people seated that day in the house chamber in Tallahassee who detected a whiff of noblesse oblige on the part of Bush and wondered, too, if he quite knew what he was doing by giving Rubio a sword. They worried that Rubio would one day use iteven against Bush.

***

Before the sword, the first time Rubio ran for office, Bush gave him money. It was March of 1998, Bush was running for governorhe had run in 1994, and lostand Rubio, 18 years younger, was running for a seat on the city commission of little West Miami, and they had a mutual friend. Al Cardenas was an ardent Bush donor who also employed Rubio at his Miami law firm. Cardenas gave the Rubio campaign $250. Bush gave $50.

Jeb was genuinely interested in helping people he agreed withsolid conservatives, said Nelson Diaz, who has known Rubio for 20 years and worked for him as his chief legislative aide in Tallahassee. Jeb did that a lot.

He kept an eye out for talented, energetic men and women who could be the future of conservatism in Florida, said Tom Feeney, Bushs running mate in 1994, who later would be the states speaker of the house.

When Rubio won his West Miami election, Bush called him to congratulate him. The next year, in 1999, Rubio won a spot in the state legislature. His baby face softened but did not conceal his obvious ambition.

He was immediately tagged as a guy who was going places, said Renier Diaz de la Portilla, who was elected to the legislature the same time as Rubio and shared an apartment with him early on.

Guzzling Mountain Dew, Rubio raced from Republican floor leader to majority whip to majority leader. By late 2003, he already had positioned himself to be speaker. His oratory in particular made him stand out. As a speech-maker, fellow lawmaker Dudley Goodlette said, Rubio was spell-binding. Said Frank Farkas, another legislator: When he would give a talk on the house floor, people just stopped. Rubios predecessor in the speakers role, Allan Bense, sometimes would attempt to gavel members to order but then turn to Rubio for help. Hed speak, Bense said, and hed calm the waters.

Even so, the man in charge in Tallahassee was not Rubioit was Bush. At the time, he was the son of a former president, and the brother of the current president, and a workaholic, activist governor with a Republican-dominated legislature. As the executive of the state of Florida, Bush almost always got his way.

Rubio, Gelber said, was obviously a superior political athlete, but Bush was the king of the hill.

Jeb, he said, was supreme.

There was then and remains now a vast contingent of Republicans in the capital city, and around the state in general, who owe to Bush their jobs, their positions and their influence. The word that comes up frequently in conversations with Florida politicos describing Bush: a cult of loyalty. Bush grew to expect loyalty, not just because it has been a basic political tenet of his family, but because in Tallahassee he so readily and regularly got it.

By the end of 2005, though, nearing the last full year of his two-term reign, Bush didnt see in presumptive next governor and then-Republican Charlie Crist a like-minded conservative. Bush needed someone to carry on his policies and to protect what he was beginning to view as his legacy.

He emailed his staff. I need to get a sword for Marco.

***

Some 170 of Rubios family members and friends flew from Miami for the ceremony in which he would be the first Cuban-American in Florida history to be designated as the speaker of the house. The floor passes that dangled from their necks, according to the St. Petersburg Times, sported a quote from Ronald Reagan. Theres no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesnt mind who gets the credit.

Throughout my career in public service, Rubio said in his much-anticipated speech, a number of people have taken the time to invest in me. He listed 10 names. He mentioned Cardenas. He mentioned Feeney. He mentioned the woman who was the mayor of West Miami when he won his first election. He mentioned state speakers, state senators, state representatives and congressman Mario Diaz-Balart.

He turned to Bense, the speaker at the time. I have learned a lot about true leadership just by watching you, Rubio said.

Bush sat in the front row, off to Rubios left, wearing a black suit and a fleshier face. Rubio thanked Bush, too, but in a different waynot personally, but on behalf of the people of Florida.

Governor Bush, Rubio said, we are honored that you have joined us here today. For the last eight years, you have been the driving intellectual force behind our movement. Your ideas have profoundly impacted the future of this state. And on behalf of the people of Florida, I thank you for your vision, for your commitment, and for your political courage. Thank you.

He pivoted quickly.

Bush giddily introduced Rubio at the victory celebration on November 2, 2010, at the swank Biltmore hotel in Coral Gables before taking a seat in the audience with his wife Columba. Im so proud of Marco, Bush began. Marco Rubio is the right man at the right time. | AP Photo/Lynne Sladky

But now, he said, this chapter in our history sets to close ...

He asked the members of the house to open packages he had left at their desks. It was a book, to be called 100 Innovative Ideas for Floridas Future. The pages were blank. Our ideas, Rubio told them, should be about tomorrow.

The speech, which is worth watching, because its a precursor for so much of what he still says today, elicited a sustained standing ovationincluding from Bush, who clapped and clapped and then shook his hand and gave him a hug and then followed Rubio at the lectern, speaking into the microphone, stumbling over his words.

Wow, Bush said. I cannotI cant think back on a time where Ive ever been prouder to be a Republican, Marco. His left hand awkwardly reached for a pocket of his suit jacket. I, uh, you know, I dont know how Im gonna talk now. I reallyI think that, uh, he capsulized exactly what the mission here is.

Bush looked up into the crowd at Rubios parents. He smiled and said, in Spanish, I know youre very proud of your little sonusing the diminutive for son, not hijo but hijito. And then Bush said this: Im 52 years old. I used to think I was young in this business. Now I see the incoming speaker of the Florida house, 34-year-old Marco Rubio, and I say, Its time.

And then he gave Rubio the gold and silver sword.

When Jeb gives Marco that sword, its sort of like, Listen, man, Im leaving, I dont know who the heck is going to be governor, and you have to keep up the mantle when Im gone, said J.C. Planas, a former legislator whos now an attorney back in Miami.

It was a big deal, former state representative Mike Haridopolos said. Whos he kind of passing the baton on to? This guy.

Marco was there to carry on the legacy of the policies he had put in place, Arza said. Jeb needed Marco.

Rubio hung the sword in his office, next to a framed Miami Dolphins jersey decorated with the autograph of former coach Don Shula, according to Rubios spokesman at the time. When the governor of the state makes a big deal of introducing you as really the standard-bearer to lead Florida in terms of conservatism, Jose Fuentes said, youre not going to toss that sword away.

Global crude oil prices kicked off the week on a bright note as they lurched higher, helping the U.S. stock market find a reason to rally.

Reuters reported the International Energy Agency, in its medium-term outlook outlined expectations for American shale production to fall by 60,000 barrels per day in 2016, and 200,000 next year. The forecast came on the heels of data that showed U.S. rig counts fell to the lowest level since 2009.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

This massive cutback in rigs is taking its toll as we have seen 123 oil rigs idled just since the beginning of this young year. That means U.S. output is in the process of topping and the price of oil is in the process of bottoming, Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the PRICE Futures Group and FOX Business contributor said in a note.

In recent action, West Texas Intermediate crude prices jumped 6.38% to $31.52 a barrel, while Brent, the international benchmark, gained 4.76% to $34.58 a barrel.

Despite the pickup, Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, said the move higher, as has been the case in several recent trading sessions, is likely short-lived.

Iran is still talking up more production, but thats OK because they and Iraq need to regain share lost to war and sanctions...that works until someone cheats on whatever freeze is agreed upon next week. I hate to be cynical, but this wont work, he said in a note to clients.

Further, Block said he could see WTI, the U.S. benchmark, hitting $40 a barrel, but not moving much higher from there.

Last week, the markets were flooded by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would put a freeze on the cartels output at January levels. Venezuela, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar were involved in floating the idea early last week before Saudi Arabia eventually walked back comments, saying it wasnt ready to trim its output, and Iran stayed mum on whether it would be willing to join the effort, which would help put upward pressure on prices hovering at multi-year lows.

Elsewhere in the market, traders ditched safe havens as they rushed to riskier assets like equities. Gold prices slipped 1.75% to $1,209 a troy ounce, as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 0.018 percentage point to 1.766%. Treasury yields move inversely to prices.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar gained 0.93% against a basket of global currencies on Monday, and as the euro dropped 1.05% against the greenback. The euros pressure came after weekend developments over a looming effort for the United Kingdom to exit the eurozone. IG senior market analyst Chris Beauchamp said in a note that the pound is down to four-week lows against the dollar as the market decides U.K. currency isnt the best place to be for now, despite IGs so-called Brexit binary shows a 67% chance the nation will stay in the EU.

Given that we have many weeks of this ahead of us, such falls in the pound are either a monumental value opportunity (if you think the gloomy case is excessive) or a chance to ride the speculative wave lower, he said.

Over the weekend, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he backs the Brexit, though Prime Minister David Cameron remains on the opposite side of the line.

Despite the ongoing chatter, European equity markets pushed higher on Monday. The Euro Stoxx 50, which tracks large-cap companies in the eurozone, jumped 1.78%. The German Dax gained 1.70%, while the French CAC 40 added 1.51%, and the U.K.s FTSE 100 rose 1.44%.","['week', 'note', 'oil', 'jumped', 'global', 'jump', 'points', 'output', 'prices', 'rally', 'stocks', 'markets', 'market', 'higher']"

PRESENTING YOUR SOUTH CAROLINA FIELD GUIDE

The polls say this should be a great day for Donald Trump  a big victory to ratify his status as the GOP frontrunner and a harbinger of future successes in the so-called SEC primary on March 1.

But the polls have gotten a little screwy in the final days of the first in the South primary, with Marco Rubio nipping past Ted Cruz in some surveys. Trumps dominance, however, hasnt been cast in much doubt.

His margin of victory matters, though. Given the resistance to Trumps nomination in many quarters of the party, a big win would be a big boost. The message from a Trump double-digit win: Resistance is futile. But if Trump stubs his toe and ends up with a narrow victory, it would only embolden his detractors.

With those high stakes in mind, the polls arent enough to get a grasp on whats really happening down South.

South Carolina Primary:

 50 total delegates

o 26 at-large awarded to the states overall winner plus the states 3 automatic delegates

UPSTATE

This is not the South Carolina of palmetto trees and ocean breezes. This is Appalachia and very much part of what Michael Barone calls The Jacksonian Belt.

Voters here are famous dissenters and have long prided themselves on their stubborn independence.

But the Upstate of South Carolina is also fastest growing region of the state. The counties of Greenville and Spartanburg are home to big businesses like Bank of America, 3M and BMW.

For all the changes, the Upstate is true to its political roots. The region is one of the most politically conservative and most religiously observant throughout the South.

The more populous counties of the upstate region should be Ted Cruzs space. These are the most conservative voters in the state and have social issues on their mind. As the son of a preacher, and self-proclaimed defender of conservativism, Cruz relates well to these voters. In order to hold on to a second-place finish, Cruz needs to win in the more populated ares.

But Marco Rubio has a chance with these voters too. He is also a strong conservative who has been touting his family values throughout the state enough that he could siphon off some support from Cruz.

MIDLANDS

Home to the states capital, Columbia, the University of South Carolina and a major military training hub, this region is fittingly somewhere on the political spectrum between the red-hot Jacksonian populism of the Upstate and the cooler political climate on the coast.

The city center and more affluent suburbs stand to be one of the biggest troves of votes for Marco Rubio. The Florida senator has paid plenty of attention to the region, often putting his plan for increased military spending front and center.

The Midlands is also home to the states best Republican bellwether, Lexington County, which includes part of Columbia and much of its suburbs, but also rural voters. A Republican stronghold, Lexington has picked the states Republican primary winner the past three presidential election cycles.

Communities farther from the population center are Trump territory. These are some of the poorest counties in South Carolina, with large African-American populations  the kinds of places polls have shown Trump excelling with blue-collar white voters. Places like Barnwell County, where 11 percent of adults have a college education and a low median household income, should be a sweep for Trump.

DOWNSTATE/COASTAL

The downstate and coastal area is the wealthiest and most politically moderate part of the state. The two major counties, Charleston and Beaufort, are vacation retreats and popular destinations for Yankee retirees fleeing cold winters.

But there is also a strong military and military retiree presence here that changes the political calculus. These are voters who lifted John McCain to his win in 2008 and kept Mitt Romney in the hunt in 2012. This should be the best part of the state for Marco Rubio, but it also is where he stands to have the most votes siphoned off by Jeb Bush and John Kasich. For Rubio to run second, he will need to prevent too much costal erosion.

Rubios endorsements from key South Carolina players like Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott should shore up any last-minute, undecided voters in this region.

Outside of these wealthier coastal towns, though, this is also Trump territory. Jasper County may be the neighbor to beachside Beaufort, but Jasper has a sliver of Beauforts population and none of the prosperity.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Ford tech lets cars 'jump' over potholes,[],"Some weather-beaten roads are so bad these days that potholes are impossible to avoid without swerving into the next lane. But what if you could just jump over them?

Thats sort of what the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport can do, when its not busy carving up the road itself.

The new high performance sedan has an active suspension system thats been programmed to know when it encounters the edge of a pothole and then reacts the same way that you do when bracing for impact, by stiffening up.

But in this case, that can keep the wheel from falling into a pothole by allowing it skip over it. By the time the rear wheel hits, the suspension has gathered more information on the obstacle and does an even better job clearing it.

Ford hasnt revealed exactly how big of a pothole the system can handle, but it partially depends on how fast the car is going. Along with making hard impacts less painful for passengers, Ford says it will help reduce damage to the suspension, wheels and tires, which a recent report from AAA says costs drivers $3 billion per year.

Unfortunately, the Fusion Sport wont be on sale until summer, when hopefully most of those potholes will be filled in, so you might have to wait until next winter to find out how good it works.","['wheel', 'works', 'pothole', 'cars', 'system', 'fusion', 'ford', 'jump', 'lets', 'tech', 'potholes', 'yearunfortunately', 'suspension', 'sport']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Zika and spring break travel: What you need to know,['Eileen Ogintz'],"That's what a lot of families are asking themselves as the Zika virus continues to spread through the Caribbean , including Mexico , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands , the Dominican Republic and Jamaica , among others -- all popular spring break destinations for families, as well as their college students.

The good news, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , only one in five people infected with Zika (primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito) will get sick. So far, those who have gotten sick in the U.S. were infected outside of the country, though it appears the virus can also be spread through sexual contact. And once you have Zika, you are unlikely to get it again. The bad news, as we all now know, however, is that ZIKA has been linked to devastating birth defects of the brain called microcephaly.

If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the CDC recommends that you postpone travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. (For the latest information about Zika virus and travel, visit www.cdc.gov/zika.) But what about the rest of us, especially kids?

At the moment, there is no evidence that Zika virus is serious in young children or older children, said Dr. H. Cody Meissner , a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases . To date, the CDC says, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding.

Dr. Meissner cautions that infants aren't fully immunized and could be at risk to other diseases like measles. Even flying with infants can pose a risk from fellow passengers who unwittingly may be spreading colds and flu or worse .""If you have a newborn, that's not the time to go on vacation,"" he said.

You also shouldn't use insect repellent on babies younger than two months, the CDC says -- another reason to skip a trip to impacted areas right now. Use mosquito nets on strollers and make sure there are screens on windows. Also consider clothes that are treated with repellent. I've used them very effectively. (You can get them at REI, L.L. Bean and ExOfficio, among other places.)

For anyone, the best method to avoid any risk from mosquito and other insect bites is to follow the CDC guidelines, which include covering exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and hats and use an appropriate insect repellent. Apply sunscreen before insect repellent. Dress kids in clothing that covers arms and legs -- admittedly tough during the day when mosquitoes bite. Make sure when you go to bed, the windows are either shut or have screens.

Just FYI, this same mosquito also carries Dengue Fever, which I know from personal experience is no fun -- my daughter got very sick while doing an internship in Nicaragua .

Of course, no one wants to get sick on vacation or come home sick. Of course, you think it isn't going to happen to you. But remember, there really isn't a treatment for ZIKA, or a vaccine. If you have symptoms -- fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis -- all you can do is rest, drink a lot of fluids and take acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain. Also consider that you could be infected, not know it and then get bitten by another mosquito that then goes on to infect someone else.

If you don't want this pesky bug to derail your plans -- and resorts are quick to say they are doing all they can to keep bugs at bay -- the CDC says you should make not getting bitten a priority.

If you'd rather avoid the hassle entirely -- maybe head to the snowinstead -- airlines, resorts and cruise lines seem to be offering refunds or credits for future travel on a case-by-case basis. Just Google your carrier, hotel or cruise line and ZIKA virus to find out what they will do for you.

If you have booked on one of Carnival's 10 brands, for example, and are pregnant, the company will offer you alternate itinerary options or a future cruise credit. ""We are proactively providing all of our guests with information regarding Zika,"" the Carnival spokesman said, adding, ""We have not altered any of our itineraries but are closely monitoring the U.S. CDC and PAHO ( Pan American World Health Organization ) travel advisories for any updates to the Zika transmission areas and communicating with our guests accordingly.""

Karisma resorts notes that no cases of the Zika virus have been reported at or near any of their properties in the Riviera Maya, Mexico , Jamaica or the Dominican Republic . But the company will honor any related requests to refrain from travel at this time without penalty.

This is one case you can't necessarily count on travel insurance, unless you have bought a policy that allows ""cancel for any reason."" Most policies don't cover cancellation due to fear of travel, explained Megan Freedman , executive director of the US Travel Insurance Association . Read the fine print carefully.

If you are pregnant, Freedman added, and your doctor has advised against travel to an area affected by Zika, check with your travel insurance carrier to see if, in that case, you would be covered. ""It is going to vary by company,"" she said.

Clearly, if you have concerns and have booked already, see what your hotel will do for you. It's certainly not unreasonable to ask for a refund in this case and remember, they want happy customers.

""We don't know the full spectrum of the disease,"" warned Dr. Meissner. ""This is an individual decision every family has to make.""

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Astronomers find supermassive black hole in giant galaxy 300 million light years away,[],"Astronomers have found one of the largest-ever black holes in giant galaxy NGC 4889, some 300 million light years away.

The Hubble space telescope has captured an incredible image of elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, which is located in the Coma Cluster. Scientists, however, note that the giant galaxy harbors a dark secret.

Related: The best of Hubble

The European Space Agency explains that the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole that has 21 billion times the mass of the Sun and an event horizon  the surface at which even light cannot escape its gravitational grasp  of approximately 81 billion miles. That makes the event horizon about 15 times the diameter of Neptunes orbit from the Sun.

However, the black holes time of swallowing stars and devouring dust is past. Astronomers believe that the gigantic black hole has stopped feeding, and is currently resting after feasting on NGC 4889s cosmic cuisine, explained the ESA, in a statement on its website. The environment within the galaxy is now so peaceful that stars are forming from its remaining gas and orbiting undisturbed around the black hole.

Scientists explain that, when it was active, NGC 4889s supermassive black hole was fuelled by a process known as hot accretion. When galactic material  such as gas, dust and other debris  slowly fell inwards towards the black hole, it accumulated and formed an accretion disc, they said. Orbiting the black hole, this spinning disc of material was accelerated by the black holes immense gravitational pull and heated to millions of degrees. This heated material also expelled gigantic and very energetic jets.

During its active period, astronomers would have classified NGC 4889 as a quasar, according to the agency, with the disk around the supermassive black hole emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way.

Related: Hubble showcases star cluster that dazzles like diamonds

The ESA notes that, although it is impossible to directly observe a black hole  as light cannot escape its gravitational pull  its mass can be indirectly determined. Using instruments on the Keck II Observatory and Gemini North Telescope, astronomers measured the velocity of the stars moving around NGC 4889s centre, it explained. These velocities  which depend on the mass of the object they orbit  revealed the immense mass of the supermassive black hole.

The Hubble space telescope, which was launched by NASA in 1990, celebrated its 25th anniversary last year.

In 2015 astronomers used three telescopes, including the Hubble to spot a baby blue galaxy that is farther away in space than any other galaxy ever seen. The galaxy, named EGS-zs8-1, is 13.1 billion light-years away.

In October the telescope also captured a stunning image of a faraway galaxy known as a barred spiral.

Earlier this year Hubble showcased a star cluster that dazzles like diamonds in an image made with data taken in 2005-2006 by the telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys.","['giant', 'telescope', 'ngc', '300', 'light', 'away', 'million', 'space', 'hubble', 'astronomers', 'black', 'mass', 'hole', 'supermassive', 'galaxy']"
foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,The heat goes on: Earth sets 9th straight monthly record,[],"WASHINGTON  The January figures are in, and Earth's string of hottest-months-on-record has now reached nine in a row. But NASA said January stood out: The temperature was above normal by the highest margin of any month on record.

And January set another record: Arctic sea ice reached its lowest point for that ice-building winter month.

NASA said January 2016 was 2.03 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates temperatures differently, said last month was 1.87 degrees, which is the second biggest margin in history. NOAA said the greatest was this past December.

January's average global temperature was a record 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit, easily beating the old January record set in 2007, according to NOAA Records go back to 1880.

There were colder-than-normal patches in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in January, but they were overwhelmed by incredible ""off our chart"" warming in the Arctic region, according to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. Siberia, northwest Canada, and a lot of Alaska were at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, she said.

That heat was why there was record low sea ice in the Arctic for this time of year, when sea ice grows, Blunden said.

January Arctic sea ice averaged only 5.2 million square miles in January, which is 90,000 square miles below the previous record set in 2011, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's also 402,000 square miles  about the size of Texas and New Mexico, combined  less than the 30-year normal.

The string of nine consecutive record hot months matches June 1997 to February 1998, which was the last time Earth had a large El Nino. It is still behind the 10 straight months of record heat in 1944, Blunden said. It's likely we'll tie that record in February, she said.

The current El Nino  an occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather around the world and spikes global temperatures  is tied with 1997-1998 for the strongest on record, according to NOAA. And while it has been predicted to ease soon, it has not lessened yet, said NOAA Climate Prediction Center deputy director Mike Halpert.

NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt blamed the record heat mostly on man-made climate change, with an assist from El Nino.","['climate', 'square', 'goes', 'monthly', 'straight', 'according', 'ice', 'noaa', 'record', 'heat', 'set', 'degrees', '9th', 'sets', 'earth', 'arctic', 'sea']"

We recently got this question from a viewer:

Dear Dr. Manny,

I get pain in my jaw when it's really cold out. Why does this happen?

Thanks,

Meghan

The first thing you should do is get your teeth checked to rule out cavities as a cause for your pain. But the weather can have an effect on your body in ways you may not expect.

Studies have shown that changes in barometric pressure that often accompany a drop in temperature can trigger pain by causing air pockets throughout your body to expand and/or shrink, putting pressure on the nerves.

Temporomandibular joint disorders, or TMJ, are also common in adult women.

Symptoms can include:

Earaches

Headaches

Chewing pain

Difficulty opening your mouth

Clicking or grating sounds in the joint

Shivering in cold weather can cause the muscles in your jaw to constrict or spasm, which can also result in pain.

Always talk to your doctor to determine the best treatment based on your condition.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Is jackfruit really the pulled pork of vegans?,"['Grace E', 'Ali Rosen']","There are a lot meat substitutes out there that purport to taste as good as the real deal.

But there's an Asian fruit that's come a serious alternative for meaty and savory protein.

Jackfruit is the largest tree-borne fruit on the planet (these beasts can weigh up to 75 pounds) and is indigenous to South America and South-east Asia.

It's got a tough, green, knobby exterior, sticky sap and odd looking seed pods that taste like a cross between a pineapple and a pear.

But in its unripened form --and after several hours of brining and basting and baking--a meaty like substance that looks something like pulled pork is created.

More on this... What's BBQ jackfruit like?

Jackfruit has started appearing on the menus of hip restaurant and mainstream barbecue joints around the country, including Baltimore's Blue Pit and San Francisco's Sneaky's BBQ. They even sold a jackfruit BBQ sandwich to Super Bowl ticket holders at Levis Stadium this month.

The process to prepare the jackfruit into something resembling barbecue is pretty time consuming, that is if you can find the raw ingredients. The jackfruit is usually sold either in a can or in a bag soaking in brine. (Chinese food markets are your best bet.)

But there are a handful of food purveyors that sell pre-made, pre-seasoned barbecue-style jackfruit.

Now, we love our pulled pork (and all types of BBQ), so we were a bit skeptical. So, we decided to take Uptown Naturals BBQ flavor to the streets of New York City--and were kind of shocked by the response.

""I'm a fan,"" said one woman.

""I like the actual pork, but this is a really good substitute,"" said another taster.

The jackfruit had the consistency of barbecue and tasted of barbecue. It was smokey, tangy and had a hint of sweetness, but at the end of the day, you knew it wasn't real barbecue.

For vegans or those who want to cut the cholesterol or meat consumption, it's a decent alternative.

But not everyone we spoke to was a fan. One person described it as eating bamboo. Another man, well, he had no words.","['jackfruit', 'real', 'pork', 'meat', 'taste', 'sold', 'vegans', 'barbecue', 'meaty', 'pulled', 'bbq', 'really']"

Ghiallgairrh pleaded guilty to disorderly behavior and criminal damage when she appeared before Chelmsford magistrates this week.

Prosecutor Karen Phillips told how Ghiallgairrh was running late for a flight to Ireland and became frustrated at the situation as she was held up in security.

Miss Phillips added: She refused to be searched, became heated, got agitated and removed her skirt, standing in her tights.

Members of the public around were distressed as she was undressing. She also banged on the desk angrily.

But Ghiallgairrh blamed the incident on the overzealous security.

She said: I was becoming increasingly frustrated by the airport staff. A police officer came from behind me as I leant casually on the table, I turned around to hear him tell me to calm down.

He said youre on drugs. I said Im not on drugs. He said I shouldnt talk to him like that because he had a machine gun.

I asked why he would need to use a machine gun on me. He said that if I didnt shut up he was going to arrest me. I asked Why? What for?

He aggressively handcuffed me and shouted section four while lifting me up by my wrist, breaking my thumb as a consequence. I screamed in pain.

The architects arm was broken when two officers arrested her. She was fined $300 after pleading guilty to disorderly behavior and criminal damage.

District Judge John Woollard fined Ghiallgairrh $160 with $40 victim surcharge and $100 costs as she sat with her arm in plaster.

He added: I have to take into account the stress you were in which led to your behavior and the fact you were surrounded by thousands of other people also stressed.

Ghiallgairrh has been in the U.K. for 18-months and the court was told she is planning on going back to Ireland.

A Flagler County police report says 25-year-old Jessica Conti demanded her money back late Friday and was angered when the clerk put her money on the counter in what Conti considered a disrespectful manner.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal (http://bit.ly/1QUODAL ) reports three men then stormed into Palm Coast Pizza and knocked a fax machine and cash register off a counter. They also threw food and pizza boxes.

They left before deputies arrived. But someone at the restaurant identified them. Deputies soon tracked them down and arrested them.

Conti, along with Vincent Conti, Hareem Jones and Shawn Cody were charged with burglary and criminal mischief. They were released from jail. It's unclear whether they've hired lawyers.

The Wake Forest head coach has had his Lawrence, KS, home on the market for almost two years. The five-bedroom, seven-bath abode is now listed for $1.95 million.

So what does the house of an ex-NBA player look like? Big, big, big. At 7,800 square feet, there's plenty of room to stretch out. The spacious residence includes multiple entertaining areas, a gourmet kitchen, a sun room, and an office.

You can live out your hoop dreams by shooting baskets where Manning did, in the indoor sports court. Outside, there's also a pool and outdoor living space.

""This is an impressive, custom-built home with unique amenities and fine finishes, in one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in northeast Kansas,"" says listing agent John Esau. ""It is priced considerably under what it would cost to build today, and we're still looking for a qualified buyer who sees the incredible value and will enjoy the home as much as the Mannings.""

If you're a big fan, you could even choose to keep the furnishings he left behind, which are available at a negotiated price. (We're not sure if those cool jerseys in the bedroom are part of the deal, but hey, you could always ask.)

While Manning has left Kansas for his coaching job in North Carolina, he'll always have roots in the plains.

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,GOP in deep blue Maryland tries in Senate race to repeat Gov. Hogans surprise win,[],"Republicans in deep-blue Maryland are hoping to pull off an upset in this year's Senate race like GOP Gov. Larry Hogan did in 2014, according to InsideSources.



Republicans are hoping to build on Hogans success by electing the first GOP U.S. senator from Maryland since 1987, in the contest to fill the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski.

Maryland House Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga is one of six GOP Senate candidates looking to duplicate the Hogan miracle in the partys April 26 primary.

As the highest-ranking Republican woman in the state Legislature, shes the perceived front-runner and boasts significant support from the political establishment.

Szeliga told InsideSources that the tide is changing in Marylan and that voters want a senator focused on jobs, national security and education.

As the only woman in the Republican field, Szeliga also argued shes a good fit for an electorate thats 60 percent female.

Its an uphill climb during a presidential election, especially in a state with more than twice as many registered Democrats as registered Republicans.

In addition, the Democratic candidate in the general election will likely either be Maryland Reps. Chris Van Hollen or Donna Edwards, who each have strong name recognition, though no strong connections to Baltimore's Democratic machine.

Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings said last week that he will not seek Mikulskis seat. Cummings has strong ties to Baltimore and would have become the instant frontrunner, according to some early polling.

Szeliga is facing several other candidates the the party primary including Chrys Kefalas, the 36-year-old vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers who thinks hes the candidate to replicate Hogans win.

A former legal counsel to Marylands previous GOP governor, Bob Ehrlich, Kefalas played up the fact that, as was the case with Hogan, hes never held public office.

""The people of Maryland, whether theyre Democrat, independent or Republican, are not looking for a politician, he said.

Szeliga touts her three decades of business experience -- including at a construction company she founded with her husband.

Kefalas said Republicans also need to compete in places like Baltimore, and in fact the entire campaign will turn on whether his party appeals to voters beyond its conservative base.

Its going to be very hard to get more Republican voters to the polls [than Hogan did in 2014], he said. The key to this election, with 250,000 or 300,000 more Democratic voters turning out in a presidential year, is doing better than Gov. Hogan did in predominantly Democratic and independent jurisdictions.

Kefalas, who is openly gay, plans to tout his advocacy for marriage equality and service as a speechwriter to former Attorney General Eric Holder.

The next-generation Galaxy S7 is expected to be one of the biggest pieces of news at the major mobile tech conference that kicks off Monday in Barcelona.

But dont expect any major changes to the physical design of Samsungs flagship phones. The curved display S7 edge should look pretty much the same, while the flatscreen S7 may see some subtle changes, according to reports.

But both Samsung phones may come with major internal changes, reflecting what Apple typically does with its s models. Those upgrades include improved battery life, a better camera, and a faster processor. All under-the-hood stuff but important to keep Samsung relevant vis-a-vis Apple.

Samsung is also keen on pushing ahead with virtual reality these days so new announcements about Gear VR are likely. The S6 and S6 edge plug into the Gear VR headset and function as the headsets display and processor. For that reason, any improvements to the S7s processor, for example, could boost the platforms capabilities.



Maybe more importantly, this would allow Samsung demonstrate that it is getting further ahead of Apple, which currently has no Apple-branded iPhone VR products (though Apple does sell third-party VR headsets on its store page).

Other major news includes:



LG: The other South Korean phone maker will show off its next-gen LG G5. So far, the most talked-about changes are not the phone itself but accessories such as a touch-enabled case. Like Samsung, LG is focusing on VR and rumors point to a few VR-related accessories and upgrades.



Huawei: the rising smartphone star is slated to make announcements at the conference. They may include a new phone but little more is known at this point outside of sketchy rumors.



Xiaomi: another rising smartphone maker, it is still heavily focused on areas outside of the U.S. Its new phone could include a raft of upgrades that new phones typically get.



Microsoft Lumia 650: while this Windows phone has already been announced, it has garnered a lot of media attention because of its top-flight materials and design. On price (about $200), it slots in below the higher-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL but beats both of those phones on aesthetics.

Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency says 11 more nations must agree to adhere to the Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material before it can enter into force.

He said Monday that its application would ""reduce the likelihood of terrorists being able to detonate a ...'dirty bomb,'"" which can spread radioactivity over a wide area. It would also reduce the risk of an attack on a nuclear power plant.

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Fox News Poll: Trump leads in South Carolina,['Dana Blanton'],"Donald Trump still leads in the race for the Republican nomination in South Carolina, according to a new Fox News poll.

Trump captures 32 percent among South Carolina likely Republican primary voters. Ted Cruz gets 19 percent to Marco Rubios 15 percent. These are the only three candidates earning double-digit support.

Jeb Bush and Ben Carson tie at nine percent each, and John Kasich gets six percent.

Theres little difference among only those who say they will definitely vote in the GOP primary: Trump garners 34 percent, Cruz 20 percent, Rubio 15 percent, Bush 8 percent, Carson 7 percent, and Kasich 6 percent.

Some support could still shift, as 25 percent of these GOP likely voters say they could change their mind.

CLICK TO READ THE POLL RESULTS.

Trump has more supporters (83 percent) who feel certain they will vote for him than Cruz (73 percent) or Rubio (71 percent).

The race remains consistent when first and second vote choices are combined: Trump 41 percent, Cruz 35 percent, Rubio 32 percent, Bush and Carson 20 percent each, and Kasich 16 percent.

The poll, released Thursday, was conducted Monday through Wednesday evenings. Many political observers felt the Republican faithful might abandon the front-runner after the rowdy February 13 GOP debate in Greenville, where Trump said President George W. Bushs administration lied to push the U.S. into the Iraq war and Planned Parenthood does wonderful things for womens health.

Even so, the performance didnt hurt Trump with his backers. Support for Trump is mostly unchanged since early December when he received 35 percent. At that time, Carson had 15 percent support, and Cruz and Rubio were tied at 14 percent.

About 6 in 10 Palmetto State Republicans identify as evangelical Christian, while 4 in 10 are very conservative, and nearly 2 in 10 have served in the military.

Among evangelical Christians voting in the GOP primary, Trump tops Cruz by eight points: Trump 31 vs. Cruz 23 percent. Rubio receives 17 percent and Bush 10 percent.

Cruz is the top pick among very conservatives -- but just barely. He receives 31 percent, Trump 29 percent, and Rubio 14 percent.

Veterans, a small subgroup of voters, back Trump (37 percent), over Cruz (22 percent), Rubio (15 percent), and Bush (9 percent).

Whites with a college degree go for Trump (30 percent), and put Rubio in second (19 percent) over Cruz (15 percent). Whites without a degree put Trump over Cruz by nine points (34-25), with Rubio in third (11 percent).

Trump is the favorite for both men (35 percent) and women (28 percent) voting in the GOP primary.

Meanwhile, nearly four in 10 South Carolina Republicans say they would never support Trump (39 percent). Thats up from 24 percent who felt that way in December.

Some 21 percent would never vote for Bush, 19 percent Cruz, and 11 percent Kasich and Rubio.

Trump also grabs the (dubious) title when voters are asked which GOP candidate has made unfair attacks against fellow Republicans.

Nearly half, 47 percent, feel Trump has attacked other Republicans unfairly. Another 28 percent say the same of Cruz, 19 percent feel Rubio has attacked unfairly, and 17 percent say Bush. Carson (10 percent) and Kasich (12 percent) perform best on this measure, as fewer say they have attacked fellow Republicans unfairly. (Multiple responses were accepted.)

The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The telephone poll (landline and cellphone) was conducted February 15-17, 2016 with live interviewers among a random sample of 1,401 South Carolina voters selected from a statewide voter file. Results for the 759 likely Republican primary voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","['carson', '15', 'trump', 'voters', 'fox', 'bush', 'leads', 'rubio', 'cruz', 'kasich', 'say', 'poll', 'gop', 'south', 'carolina']"

Days before North Koreas latest nuclear-bomb test, the Obama administration secretly agreed to talks to try to formally end the Korean War, dropping a longstanding condition that Pyongyang first take steps to curtail its nuclear arsenal.

Instead the U.S. called for North Koreas atomic-weapons program to be simply part of the talks. Pyongyang declined the counter-proposal, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. Its nuclear test on Jan. 6 ended the diplomatic gambit.

The episode, in an exchange at the United Nations, was one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obamas second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,8 position players whose health could make or break their teams,[],"With position players due to report this week -- the ones who aren't already in camp, anyway -- the health of many stars who missed large chunks of last season and/or had surgery during the offseason will be a hot topic.

And that is especially true for these would-be contenders, all of whom will keep one eye on the training room and one on the field this spring. The recoveries that could shape their seasons:

Yadier Molina, C, Cardinals. The heart and soul of the Cardinals, Molina is the equivalent of having a coach on the field. He is vital to the success of the pitching staff and, despite a decline at the plate, still is a key contributor to the lineup. The timing of his thumb injury couldn't have been worse, as he missed the final two weeks of the 2015 regular season before returning at far less than 100 percent in the NLDS. Two surgeries later, Molina's status for the start of the season is in question.

Giancarlo Stanton, RF, Marlins. Few players mean as much to a team's success as Stanton, who never has played in more than 145 games in a season and has failed to top 125 games in three of the past four years. He was limited to 74 games in 2015 thanks to a broken hamate bone in his left hand that ended his season on June 26. Miami is a strong sleeper candidate this season, but only if Stanton can stay in the lineup.

Michael Brantley, LF, Indians. After shoulder surgery in November, Brantley is highly unlikely to be ready in April. And even May looks dicey. As Cleveland's best offensive player and a strong defensive outfielder, Brantley will be sorely missed. And keep in mind that the Indians needed outfield help even before Brantley went under the knife. That help didn't arrive in the offseason, and a slow start without Brantley would be damaging.

Albert Pujols, 1B, Angels. After offseason surgery on his right foot, Pujols is looking doubtful for Opening Day. The big question is how much time he will miss after that; anything more than a couple weeks will be costly considering he blasted 40 homers last season. Pujols has missed only eight games over the past two seasons combined, but Los Angeles' lineup already is a couple of bats short even with him in it. At age 36, the three-time MVP figures to be used more often at DH in an attempt to keep him as healthy as possible.

Mark Teixeira, 1B, Yankees. Teixeira was in the midst of an outstanding season when he fouled a pitch off his right leg on Aug. 17. What initially was projected as a day-to-day injury eventually was diagnosed to be a fractured shin. He played in just two more games -- none after Aug. 26 -- and New York sorely missed his bat. Heading into spring training, Teixeira is healthy and the Yankees need him to stay that way with backup Greg Bird out for the season after shoulder surgery.

Yasiel Puig, RF, Dodgers. Not only did he play in only 79 games last season, he was unproductive and exasperating. Puig missed five weeks early in the season with a hamstring injury, then was sidelined by another hammy issue for five more weeks late in the season. He returned in time for the postseason but went hitless in six at-bats. At the Dodgers' request, Puig has trimmed down and seemingly is embracing his fresh start. Now he must prove it on the field.

Hunter Pence, RF, Giants. Pence played all 162 games in 2013 and 2014 but was limited to just 52 games last season. He missed all of April while recovering from a fractured left wrist, then missed most of June with tendinitis in the same wrist. He didn't play after Aug. 17 because of a strained oblique. But the emotional leader is fully healthy this spring as San Francisco pursues another even-year World Series title.

Jung Ho Kang, 3B, Pirates. His strong rookie season came to a painful end on a takeout slide at second base on Sept. 17. Kang suffered a knee injury that required surgery -- and a recovery timetable of 6-8 months. Already fielding grounders in camp, Kang appears to be making good progress. However, the Pirates aren't going to rush him, which means the disabled list is possible even if Kang gets some playing time during spring training.","['training', 'missed', 'spring', 'season', 'teams', 'break', 'players', 'brantley', 'health', 'games', 'kang', 'position', 'weeks', 'injury', 'surgery']"

Cara McCollum died at Cooper University Hospital, according to Frank DiMauro, chief operating officer of the TV station where she worked, and a Facebook message posted by her family.

Her family said in the Facebook post that the 24-year-old from Margate died with her family by her side in an operating room, and that her organs were donated.

""We've prayed constantly for a miracle, and we believe God has answered our prayers. Although it's not the miracle that we first envisioned, it's a miracle nonetheless,"" the family said. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years. ... We all will miss her now that she's gone.""

Her family posted a video of McCollum performing a version of ""Cups"" by Anna Kendrick in the film ""Pitch Perfect.""

The song includes the lyrics ""you're gonna miss me when I'm gone"" and was performed by Miss New York Kira Kazantsev when she won the Miss America pageant in September 2014. McCollum competed in the previous year's pageant after winning the 2013 Miss New Jersey title.

The Arkansas native graduated from Princeton University and was an anchor on SNJ Today, a news show serving the southern Jersey area.

She was dating Keith Jones, a TV anchor for Philadelphia's NBC affiliate.

""Please accept our sincerest thanks for your heartfelt prayers,"" Jones wrote on Facebook. ""Words fall short of describing the pain, but I'm eternally grateful and blessed for the time I spent with Cara. Her enormous heart enriched my life and changed me forever.""

McCollum was alone in her vehicle and was not wearing a seatbelt when her Mustang veered off Route 55 in Pittsgrove Township and struck a tree, then spun again and hit two more trees before ending up in an embankment, police said.

State police say McCollum appeared to have been driving too fast for conditions on the wet road. They do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.

(AP) -- Ryan Kesler had two goals and an assist, John Gibson made 22 saves and the Anaheim Ducks returned from a lengthy road trip with their fifth consecutive victory, 5-2 over the Calgary Flames on Sunday night.

Captain Ryan Getzlaf extended his point streak to eight games with a third-period goal for the streaking Ducks, who have won 12 of 14 to improve to 19-4-2 since Christmas. Anaheim also trimmed Los Angeles' lead to two points atop the Pacific Division.

Patrick Maroon and Kevin Bieksa also had power-play goals as Anaheim beat the Flames at home for the 22nd consecutive time.

Captain Mark Giordano scored his career-best 15th goal and former Ducks goalie Jonas Hiller stopped 28 shots for the Flames, who have lost four of five.

Mikael Backlund added a last-minute goal for Calgary, which hasn't won a regular-season game at Honda Center since Jan. 19, 2004.

Kesler had his first three-point game of the season in the Ducks' dynamic return from a seven-game road trip during which they won five times and surged into second place in the Pacific.

Anaheim even scored five goals for the fourth consecutive game, continuing the offense's sharp turnaround after being the league's lowest-scoring team for most of the season. The Ducks chased Hiller while beating the Flames 6-4 in Calgary six days ago.

Maroon put the Ducks ahead late in the first period with his fourth goal of the season, pouncing after Calgary's Lance Bouma went down in pain while blocking a shot.

Kesler ended a 10-game goal drought with a wrist shot early in the second, but Giordano scored less than two minutes later, converting a slick pass from Johnny Gaudreau on a power play.

The Ducks quickly seized control in the third period. Getzlaf scored his 19th point in 13 games on a pass from David Perron just 16 seconds in, and Kesler made it 4-1 shortly afterward when he ripped the puck away from Deryk Engelland for an unassisted goal.

After Bieksa scored a goal in his second straight game, Backlund got his sixth goal in eight games with 45 seconds left.

NOTES: Flames D Kris Russell missed his fourth straight game with a lower-body injury. ... Ducks F Andrew Cogliano played in his 680th consecutive game, passing Henrik Sedin for the sixth-longest streak in NHL history. Cogliano also has the second-longest streak to begin a career. ...

Iranian authorities have not publicly announced any charges against Namazi. However, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, who claimed to be Namazi's attorney, said in a phone interview with Reuters Friday that he had not received permission to see his client.

Its not only #OscarSoWhite. It's also #HollywoodSoWhite, at least according to one of the most exhaustive and damning reports on diversity in Hollywood.

A comprehensive study by the University of Southern Californias Annenberg School of Communications and Journalism found that the films and television shows produced by major media companies are whitewashed and that an epidemic of invisibility runs top to bottom through the industry for women, minorities and LGBT people.

The full results of the study were slated to be released Monday.

""The prequel to OscarsSoWhite is HollywoodSoWhite,"" said Stacy L. Smith, a USC professor and one of the study's authors, in an interview. ""We don't have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.""

The study, coming less than a week before the Academy Awards big night, offers one of the most wide-ranging examinations of the film and television industries. It includes a pointed inclusivity index of 10 major media companies  from Disney to Netflix  that gives a failing grade to every movie studio and most TV makers.

For a second year in a row, this year's Oscars are plagued with all-white acting nominees.

The report offers a new barrage of sobering statistics that further evidence a deep discrepancy between Hollywood and the American population it entertains, in gender, race and ethnicity.

The study, titled the Inclusion of Invisibility? Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, examined the 109 films released by major studios (including art-house divisions) in 2014 and 305 scripted, first-run TV and digital series across 31 networks and streaming services that aired from September 2014 to August 2015. More than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status. Some 10,000 directors, writers and show creators were examined, as was the gender of more than 1,500 executives.

The portrait is one of pervasive underrepresentation, no matter the media platform, from CEOs to minor characters. ""Overall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,"" the study concludes.

In the 414 studied films and series, only a third of speaking characters were female, and only 28.3 percent were from minority groups  about 10 percent less than the makeup of the U.S. population. Specifically, Hispanic or Laitno characters made up only 5.8 percent of those seen on screen of which 37.9 percent are female.

The study found that 39.5 perfect of Latina characters are in a sexualized attire and 35.5 percent are with some nudity - it is the most among all females.

Characters 40 years or older skew heavily male across film and TV: 74.3 percent male to 25.7 percent female. Just 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).

""When we start to step back to see this larger ecology, I think we see a picture of exclusion,"" said Smith. ""And it doesn't match the norms of the population of the United States.""

Behind the camera, the discrepancy is even greater. Directors overall were 87 percent white. Broadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.

Just 15.2 percent of directors, 28.9 percent of writers and 22.6 percent of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap is greatest: Only 3.4 percent of the films studied were directed by women, and only two directors out of the 109 were black women: Ava DuVernay (""Selma"") and Amma Asante (""Belle"").

Following a request made in May by the American Civil Liberties Union (which cited previous USC studies, as well as those by UCLA and the Directors Guild in claiming women have been ""systematically excluded"" from directing jobs), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year began investigating gender discrimination in Hollywood.

The federal investigation is just one element of growing scrutiny for the industry. But for protesters, finding a target for what some consider a systematic problem isn't easy. Even many of those, like Spike Lee, who have criticized the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, have insisted the issue goes far deeper than Oscar nominees. When academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs recently announced dramatic steps to diversify the overwhelmingly white and male film academy, she said: ""The academy is going to lead, and not wait for the industry to catch up.""

USC's study, which the school has been publishing in various forms for the last 10 years, also seeks to add a new metric in the conversation. The ""inclusivity index"" is a report card for the performances of 21st Century Fox, CBS, NBC Universal, Sony, the Walt Disney Co., Time Warner, Viacom, Amazon, Hulu and Netflix. Those companies encompass all the broadcast networks, most major cable channels, all of the major movie studios and three of the dominant streaming services.

Each was rated by their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters; and of female writers and directors. None of the six major studios rated better than 20 percent overall; Time Warner fared poorest of all with a score of zero. The report concludes that the film industry ""still functions as a straight, white, boy's club.""

Disney, Sony, Paramount, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. didn't immediate comment Sunday night.

Some of the same companies, however, scored better when their TV and digital offerings were evaluated. Disney, the CW, Amazon and Hulu all scored 65 percent and above.

""When we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavor is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,"" said Smith. ""They're impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive  Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree  those companies, if they're producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this. We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive.""

USC researchers also, for the first time, added analysis of those 10 companies' executives. Researches didn't have racial or ethnic background information, but found that women represent about 20 percent of corporate boards, chief executives and executive management teams.

""As prestige or power of the title increases, we see fewer women at the top,"" said Katherine Pieper, who co-authored the study with Smith and Marc Choueiti. ""Film still has a prestige to it, so we see fewer women filling those positions.""

The research offers the chance for comparison between mediums. Do streaming services adhere to the established patterns of traditional television or deviate from them?

In some cases, they do, but in many, they don't. Netflix (20 percent on the inclusion index) scored about the same as NBC Universal, CBS and Fox. There were far fewer female directors working in digital series (11.8 percent) than in broadcast (17.1 percent), in the shows studied. Broadcast, cable and steaming series also all revel in sexualized female characters and nudity more than movies do.

But some of the study's most troubling finds are simply absences. Roughly 50 percent of the examined content didn't feature one Asian or Asian-American character; 20 percent didn't include one black character. Researchers argue for change beyond ""tokenism,"" including making target goals public and creating a system of checks and balances in storytelling decisions.

""People are still erased. It's 2016 and it's time for a change,"" said Smith. ""We've laid out concrete actionable steps because we don't want to do this again in 10 years.""

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Denny Hamlin edges Martin Truex Jr. for closest Daytona 500 in history,[],"Denny Hamlin won the closest Daytona 500 in history, beating Martin Truex Jr. to the finish by less than six inches on Sunday.

By the time it came to the end of the race, many of the pre-race favorites had raced themselves out of contention including Dale Earnhardt Jr., who wrecked with 30 laps to go while struggling to get back up front.

Sprint Cup rookie Chase Elliott, the youngest pole-sitter in Daytona 500 history, led the field to green with Matt Kenseth starting alongside Elliott on the front row.

Elliott elected to start on the inside with Hendrick Motorsports teammate Earnhardt Jr. lined up behind him to push. Together, they quickly surged to the lead with Elliott in front and Earnhardt on his bumper.

But by Lap 5, Earnhardt had surged into the lead.

And on Lap 19, Elliott's day ended in disaster when his No. 24 Chevy got loose in the middle of Turn 4 on Lap 19 and started to go around, tail first. After contact with Carl Edwards who was on the low line, Elliott spun onto pit road and then into the tri-oval grass.

When Elliott hit the grass, it tore the splitter off his car, which got stuck in the infield. Elliott's car had to be towed into the garage.

Elliott took full blame for the incident.

Asked what happened, Elliott replied: ""I'm not sure, just got turned around there off of four. Got in the middle and got loose. Lost it and spun out. I hate it for everybody at less than 20 laps in and have something dumb like that happen. I apologize to my guys.""

After his Hendrick Motorsports crew made repairs, Elliott rejoined the race on Lap 59, 40 laps down.

There were other incidents throughout the race.

On Lap 56, last year's winner, Joey Logano checked up coming out of Turn 4 and was hit from behind by Brian Vickers, who went on a lurid spin in the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Edwards took evasive action to avoid Vickers' car, and when he did, Edwards hit the wall, incurring front-end damage on his JGR Toyota.

On Lap 92, rookie Chris Buescher and Matt DiBenedetto got tangled up and crashed hard into the outside wall, ruining both of their days.

""I really saw nothing,"" Buescher said. ""Matt was in (the infield care center) with us and he apologized, and I appreciate that. I just hate it for Love's Travel Stops coming on board for our first Daytona 500, and to leave it like this is not ideal by any means.""

DiBenedetto later added: ""I have no excuse. I went in there with a head of steam and got sideways.""

And on Lap 116, Greg Biffle slapped the outside wall, bringing out the fourth caution and doing considerable damage to his No. 16 Roush Fenway Racing Ford.

Hamlin led 94 of the first 155 laps before giving up the lead to come to pit road for a green-flag stop with 45 to go.

Meanwhile, four drivers who were among the pre-race favorites combined to dominate the first 120 laps of the race with Hamlin, defending Sprint Cup champion Kyle Busch, Jimmie Johnson and Earnhardt combining to lead 111 of those laps.

Hamlin led the most and soon cycled back into the lead following pit stops after Biffle's incident.

Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday, Fox News projects, beating Bernie Sanders and breathing new life into her campaign just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

Though the victory appears to be a narrow one, Clinton is hoping the win will serve to undercut Sanders' momentum as they head next into several delegate-heavy contests.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.

With 66 percent of precincts reporting in Nevada, Clinton has 52 percent to Sanders' 48 percent.

The balloting in Nevada coincides with the Republican primary Saturday in South Carolina, where front-runner Donald Trump is hoping for a decisive win.

In Nevada, Clinton was looking to rebound after losing big to Sanders in the party's New Hampshire primary, and only narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses.

The candidates spent their final hours before the caucuses furiously trying to drive up turnout among their supporters.

Significant spending by Sanders on paid media and staff helped his campaign make inroads into the Latino and African-American communities, which make up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate in the state.

It wasn't enough to edge out Clinton. But each candidate benefited from a different set of constituencies.","['sanders', 'life', 'breathing', 'clinton', 'hoping', 'campaign', 'win', 'fox', 'primary', 'beats', 'disastrous', 'narrative', 'nevada', 'caucuses', 'democratic']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Spanish gold medalist believes she contracted Zika in Rio,[],"SAO PAULO (AP) -- Spanish Olympic gold medalist Marina Alabau says she got Zika while training in Brazil in December, suffering painful symptoms in an experience that the wind surfer said won't stop her from competing in the Games in August.

In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Alabau described symptoms that her doctor said were in line with Zika, a virus that the World Health Organization has deemed an ""international health emergency."" She is currently competing at the RS: X World Championship in Israel.

Brazil is an epicenter of Zika, and fear about the virus could scare fans and some athletes from coming to the South American country's first Olympics. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and sports authorities preparing for hundreds of thousands of visitors to the country have said the Games will be held as scheduled in August.

Many scientists and doctors believe that the mosquito-borne disease is linked to a rare birth defect called microcephaly, or abnormally small heads in infants. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned pregnant women to avoid traveling to more than two dozen countries and territories in the Americas where active outbreaks are taking place. Authorities in several countries have urged women to put off pregnancy for a few years.

Despite some very difficult days after getting Zika, the 30-year-old Alabau nevertheless has urged her fellow athletes not to worry.

""There is too much alarm surrounding this. I had the virus and it wasn't that bad. I didn't even go to the hospital,"" she said.

Alabau said that while training in Rio de Janeiro on one December day, she came down with a fever. It would pass within 24 hours, but other symptoms soon followed.

""Then my whole body turned red and everything itched. Two days later, my joints started aching,"" she said. ""First it was in the fingers, then my wrists and finally my ankles. It was then that I decided to return to Spain because I was a little worried.""

Alabau said she was not tested for Zika at the time because it seemed like a common bug that her body would eventually defeat. However, she said she would get tested when she is back in Spain in early March. Normally, the virus doesn't stay in the blood more than several weeks, so it's unclear whether it will show up when she does a test next month.

Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's executive director for outbreaks and health emergencies, said Friday the mosquito population is expected to drop off around when Rio hosts the Games, because it will be winter in the Southern Hemisphere. He told a news conference in Geneva that Rio's Olympic venues are in a relatively confined area, making it easier to control the mosquitoes.

""Brazil is going to have a fantastic Olympics and it's going to be a successful Olympics and the world is going to go there,"" Aylward said.

Carmen Vaz, the Spanish wind surfing federation doctor who diagnosed Alabau, told the AP that the Zika diagnosis was based on the athlete's symptoms and not on blood work. She said that without blood work other mosquito-borne illnesses with similar symptoms, such as dengue or chikingunya, could not be ruled out.

""At the time, the Zika tests were not available in Spain, as alarm over the virus hadn't taken hold,"" she wrote in an email exchange. Vaz added that she and Alabau had decided to come forward with what had happened to the athlete to ""help lower the social alarm that has taken hold, which in our view has been excessive.""

Only about 20 percent of people who get Zika have symptoms, and except for the potential threat to fetuses, it rarely has lasting effects. By contrast, dengue can be particularly lethal, as periodic outbreaks in Brazil kill hundreds each year.

Alabau, who won a gold medal in the 2012 Olympics in London, said the pains continued when she returned home to Spain in early January.

She said she had more pain in her joints and headaches that would last a few hours and then go away.

""I had never had such strange headaches,"" she said.

Alabau said her doctor told her that she could only wait it out.

""There was nothing more to do,"" Alabau said. ""The doctor told me that in four to five days my joints would stop aching.""

Alabau noted by the end of January she was back in competition, first in Miami and now in Israel.

""Some athletes ask me about it and I say it isn't as serious as they say,"" she said. ""It's not as bad a flu or a cold. I always have a great time in Brazil. This was just a little detail.""","['olympics', 'medalist', 'gold', 'doctor', 'alabau', 'contracted', 'believes', 'symptoms', 'rio', 'virus', 'health', 'spanish', 'world', 'told', 'spain', 'zika']"

Researchers analyzed some 38,600 samples of illegal marijuanaincluding plant material, hashish, and hash oilseized by the DEA over the past 20 years, reports Live Science.

Not only did samples of a really potent type of marijuana, known as sinsemilla, increase from 2010 to 2014, but researchers found the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in samples jumped from 4% in 1995 to 12% in 2014; an earlier study in Colorado found some samples contained up to 30% THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in weed.

At the same time, the presence of cannabidiol (CBD)which is believed to have possible health benefitsdropped so that the THC level grew from 14 times the amount of CBD in 1995-era marijuana to 80 times the amount in 2014.

Lead author Mahmoud ElSohlywho helps supply high-quality marijuana to researchers through a program at Ole Miss, per the Oxford Eaglesays higher doses of THC bring a higher risk of negative health effects, including psychosis and panic attacks, while lower doses usually produce ""a pleasant feeling."" But why is more potent pot hitting the market? ElSohly explains marijuana users can develop a tolerance for THC so they need higher doses to get high.

Growers can also charge more for pot with extra THC. (Potent pot may cause concussion-like effects.)

In the wake of Tim Cook penning a letter warning of the dangerous precedent that would be set if Apple acquiesced to the court order in question, McAfee stepped up to the plate with an offer to decrypt the terrorist's iPhone 5c free of charge.

DON'T MISS: Legendary iPhone hacker weighs in on Apple's war with the FBI

In an op-ed posted to BusinessInsider Thursday, McAfee said that the FBI's demand, coupled with the corresponding court order, marks the ""end of the US as a world power.""

""No matter how you slice this pie, if the government succeeds in getting this back door, it will eventually get a back door into all encryption, and our world, as we know it, is over,"" McAfee added. ""In spite of the FBI's claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that's impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government. Then a few million dollars, some beautiful women (or men), and a yacht trip to the Caribbean might be all it takes for our enemies to have full access to our secrets.""

Okay, there's nothing too wild just yet, but this is McAfee we're talking about so you might want to buckle up.

Later on in his op-ed, McAfee says that he works the best hackers in the business, ""prodigies"" he calls them. Working together, McAfee claims that his motley crew of hackers, relying primarily upon social engineering techniques, would be able to break iPhone encryption in just three weeks.

""I would eat my shoe on the Neil Cavuto show if we could not break the encryption on the San Bernardino phone. This is a pure and simple fact.""

""So here is my offer to the FBI. I will, free of

charge, decrypt the information on the San Bernardino phone, with my team. We will primarily use social engineering, and it will take us three weeks.

""These fixed antennas will scan the sky and, as they move along with the Earth's rotation, will observe different regions to detect the emission of hydrogen clouds in galaxies younger than ours, conducting 'mapping' of the galaxy in the middle stage between the present and the Big Bang,"" Gonzalo Tancredi, the project supervisor on the Uruguayan side, said.

""The goal ... is to determine how the disturbances generated by the Big Bang expanded through the universe and to measure the variations in explosions in that intermediate stage, observing how the universe originated and evolved, and debating different models of origin and evolution,"" Tancredi said.

The array for the project, called ""Bingo,"" will be installed in an abandoned quarry in Minas de Corrales, a town in the northern province of Rivera.

The location was chosen to meet the requirements of a latitude between 30 and 35 degrees south, and an area with a low level of interference from radio waves and not to close to a city, Tancredi, director of the Astronomy Department at the University of the Republic, said.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Donald Trump muses about Marco Rubio's eligibility to run for president,[],"Marco Rubio has joined Ted Cruz in Donald Trumps crosshairs.

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","['video', 'marco', 'run', 'trump', 'born', 'muses', 'naturalborn', 'rubio', 'rubios', 'eligibility', 'donald', 'cruz', 'trumps', 'citizen', 'president', 'george']"
foxnews,2014-05-07 00:00:00,Top 5 planning tools for summer travel,['Henrik Kjellberg'],"Summer is just around the corner, which means many are making plans for their big getaway.

Planning a trip is exciting, but it can also be exhausting. Whether its finding the best hotel deal, keeping track of booking information or getting directions to wherever youre going, there are a few easy-to-use resources that can cut down the stress.

Here are my five favorite travel resources, designed to make any vacation thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

1.&nbspHassle-Free Planning TripIt One of the most stressful parts of planning a trip is ensuring you have all your information  hotel address, car rental information, restaurant reservations, etc.  in one place. TripIt is one of the best tools available. Just input (or email) your booking information, and you get a detailed itinerary  generated entirely by TripIt  that is accurate and easy to access. Your itinerary can be as detailed as you want, and its easy to share with family and friends.

2.&nbspSimplified Currency Exchange The Converted When traveling abroad, trading your cash for foreign bills is a good way to get hustled. Currency rates at money exchange booths are notoriously bad, and theyre entirely avoidable in this digital age. Try The Converted, an app for iOS and Android smartphones. Its crisp and clear layout allows users to easily convert their own currency into the currency of the country theyre visiting. The exchange rates are updated daily, so it serves as a great baseline to make sure youre not getting swindled. The app is also great for converting units  a function that should prove especially handy for American travelers who arent familiar with the metric system.

3.&nbspNavigation Know-How Waze Whether traveling near or far, its always a good idea to have a navigational aid, and one of my favorites is Waze. This free, easy-to-use app is a huge boon whenever Im on a road Ive never driven before. Not only does Waze give navigational directions (including spoken turn-by-turn instructions), but it also processes information from other Waze users to calculate the worst traffic spots and provide the fastest, most efficient routes for getting around. It can add hours of vacation time that you might otherwise spend in traffic. Plus, you dont need to worry about where to fill up; Waze will direct you to nearby gas stations.

4.&nbspHotel Room Bookings from Your Fingertips Hotwire Booking hotels at the 11th hour can lead to some very steep discounts.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Badgers make big second-half comeback to defeat Illinois,[],"MADISON, Wis. -- Ethan Happ had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and helped spark a 17-0 run that allowed Wisconsin to roar back from a double-digit deficit in the second half of a 69-60 win on Sunday night over Illinois.

Happ, an athletic 6-foot-9 freshman, had three steals during the decisive run for the Badgers (17-10, 9-5 Big Ten), who avoided a potentially damaging loss to their NCAA tournament resume.

Wisconsin rallied from a 13-point deficit with about 12 minutes left. It was the team's best comeback win since overcoming a 15-point deficit in the second half at home to an unbeaten and No. 1 Ohio State on Feb. 12, 2011.

Nigel Hayes scored 13 of his 17 points in the second half after being held without a field goal in the first half.

Malcolm Hill scored 20 points and Kendrick Nunn added 15 for Illinois (12-15, 4-10). The high-scoring duo hit all the tough shots until the Illini became unglued in the second half.

Illinois went more than seven minutes of the half without a field goal, and coach John Groce appeared unhappy at times with the officials with a foul disparity favoring Wisconsin.

The Illini were whistled for 19 fouls in the second half to seven for Wisconsin.

Happ, Hayes and guard Bronson Koenig seized on almost every opportunity, a stark contrast to the first half. The Badgers shot 8 of 28 from the field and 1 of 13 from the 3-point arc before halftime, and the slump stretched early into the second half.

Trailing 46-33, Hayes got the run started with a jumper with 11:55 left.

Michael Finke finally ended the Badgers' surge with a dunk with 5:09 left to get Illinois within 50-48.

But in between, the Illini missed six field goals, two foul shots and committed turnovers on four straight possessions.

Named ASTRO-H, the observatory includes five specialized X-ray space telescopes and detectors developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). This allows scientists to examine cosmic sources of X-rays at unpreceded resolutions and explore the most energetic and mysterious phenomena in the Universe, involving particles at energies that can't be readily produced in Earth-based labs.

In a statement, JAXA said the launch of ASTRO-H on the H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 30 was successful and that the satellite  which it nicknamed Hitomi  was currently in good health. The launch took place at Tahegashima Space Center on the Japanese island of the same name at 5:45 p.m. (3:45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time).

The launch was originally scheduled for Feb. 12 but postponed due to bad weather.

The project, which includes contributions from the United States, Europe and Canada, is nothing short of ambitious. According to JAXA, the goal is to study the structure of the universe and physics in extreme conditions and answer several questions critical to astronomy  how do black holes develop? How are galaxy clusters created? When were heavy elements in the universe created and how much?

Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.



Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.



Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession  predict it often enough and youll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.

Skulls of the fish known as Rhinconichthys were found in Colorado and the re-examination of a second one from Japan  which triples the numbers of species in the genus known to science and greatly expands their geographical range. Until now, the only fossils of this fish had been found in England.

Related: Scientists discover prehistoric 'Jurassic butterfly'

The fish dates to 92 million years during the Cretaceous Period.

Based on our new study, we now have three different species of Rhinconichthys from three separate regions of the globe, each represented by a single skull, Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University, said of the species that have been named R. purgatoirensis and R. uyenoi. This tells just how little we still know about the biodiversity of organisms through the Earth's history. It's really mindboggling.

Rhinconichthys belongs to an extinct bony fish group called pachycormids, which contains the largest bony fish ever to have lived. Estimated to have been than 6.5 feet, its strangest feature might be the pair of bones called hyomandibulae that formed a massive oar-shaped lever to protrude and swing the jaws open extra wide, like a parachute.

The case of the odd, unexplained whistling noise is uncovered during an upcoming episode of the Science Channel series, NASAs Unexplained Files. The episode focuses on a strange event experienced by the crew members of Apollo 10, a mission which flew to the moon, entered lunar orbit and got within 5,000 feet of the moons surface in preparation for Apollo 11s historic flight two months later.

The Apollo 10 astronauts  Tom Stafford, John Young and Eugene Cernan  can be heard on recordings from the flight talking about the strange sound, and whether to tell NASA about it.

It sounds like, you know, outer space-type music, one of the astronauts says.

Shall we tell [NASA] about it? an astronaut asks.

I dont know, another replies. We ought to think about it.

Theres no record of the astronauts discussing the noise with NASA or with the public. Its unclear if the astronauts ever heard the noise on subsequent passes on the far side of the moon or if other astronauts on subsequent missions heard the sound. Young eventually flew back to the moon and walked on it as the commander of Apollo 16. Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 mission and was the last man to walk on the moon. Stafford flew in space again, but never journeyed back to the moon.

The May 1969 tapes were recorded while Stafford, Young and Cernan were on the far side of the moon, out of radio communication with Earth. The whistling sound lasted nearly the entire hour the astronauts were out of touch. Later, the recordings were sent back to Mission Control where they were transcribed, archived and classified, per protocol.

The conversation was eventually unearthed in 2008.

Some technicians have speculated the sound may have originated from interference from VHF radios on the command module and lunar module interacting with each other, according to researcher and author Andrew Chaikin.

But not everyone buys that explanation.

The Apollo 10 crew is very used to the kind of noise that they should be hearing, Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden said in a clip from the episode. Logic tells me that if there was something recorded on there, then there was something there.","['sound', 'noise', 'far', 'flew', 'young', 'astronauts', 'hearing', 'reported', 'nasa', 'music', 'module', 'apollo', 'odd', 'moon', 'stafford']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,'Deadpool' dominates box office for second straight week,[],"Marvel's R-rated antihero smash ""Deadpool"" continued to dominate movie theaters over the weekend, earning an estimated $55 million and trouncing a trio of newcomers.

After pulling in a massive $152.2 million in its President's Day weekend four-day debut, the comic book adaptation from 20th Century Fox starring Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed mercenary again topped the North American box office. Having already grossed $235.4 million domestically, ""Deadpool""  made for just $58 million  is poised to become one of the most successful R-rated movies ever.

Globally, the film  now certain to spawn a franchise of its own  has made $491.1 million thus far.

Among new releases, the faith-based drama ""Risen"" debuted with $11.8 million. The film, in which Joseph Fiennes plays a Roman soldier investigating the death and resurrection of Jesus, was made for about $20 million by Sony's Affirm label, which targets evangelical Christian moviegoers.

A24's critically acclaimed Puritan thriller ""The Witch"" opened with $8.7 million, marking the biggest opening of the indie label behind the Oscar-nominated drama ""Room."" A24 celebrated Robert Eggers' directorial debut  an austere 1600s horror film, rigorously authentic to the period  as not only the company's biggest weekend in its three-year history, but one that put ""The Witch"" on course to be ""the most successful film of all time with a goat in a starring role.""

It may have been too art house for some horror fans, though, as ""The Witch"" received a poor C-minus CinemaScore from audiences.

The Jesse Owens biopic from Focus Features, ""Race,"" struggled to find its footing with $7.3 million. Directed by Stephen Hopkins, ""Race"" stars Stephan James as the Olympic sprinter.

Edging out the three debuts was Fox's ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" which made $12.5 million in its fourth weekend. The animated sequel, which has made $117.1 million in total, will lose its near-exclusive window of family moviegoing next weekend when Disney's ""Zootopia"" opens. That film has already begun its overseas rollout, where it made $31.2 million from 22 territories over the weekend.

FBI Director James Comey said late Sunday that the agency owed the victims of last December's San Bernardino terror attack a ""thorough and professional investigation"" in an effort to explain why law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help them gain access to a cellphone owned by one of the gunmen.

In a post on the Lawfare blog, Comey wrote that the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

The post was Comey's first public statement since Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into Syed Farook's work-issued iPhone. Farook, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in the Dec. 2 attacks.

On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with the court order. Early Monday, Cook sent an email to Apple employees saying that the FBI should withdraw its demand.

In the message, subject-lined ""Thank you for your support,"" Cook states that the company has ""no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists"" and believes abiding by the judge's order would be unlawful, an expansion of government powers, and would set a dangerous precedent that would essentially create a backdoor to the encrypted iPhone.

A middle school students Black Lives Matter poster on display in a suburban New York courthouse has generated controversy with some retired cops, according to a local television station.

The poster is part of a Black History Month exhibit at the Central Islip courthouse on Long Island. But three retired NYPD officers told CBS2 New York last week that the drawing doesnt belong in a courthouse. One referred to it as hate speech.

Black Lives Matter we feel is anti-police and the rhetoric that they spew is anti-police and weve actually had them on video walking the streets of New York City calling for the death of police officers, retired NYPD officer and Internet radio host Ed Munoz told the station.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge: Memory Upgrades Are Back,[],"Despite what management consultants may say, not all change is good, particularly regarding smartphone design. When Samsung ditched water-resistance and the inexpensive memory upgrade option on last years Galaxy S6 smartphones, a lot of consumers complained, even though the new phones had sleeker glass-and-aluminum cases and added convenient wireless and quick-charging options.

Enter the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones, announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. These models bring back the water-resistance and memory features while retaining their sleek cases and multi-charge conveniences. In fact, the Samsung S7 and S7 edge can dive deeper and accommodate larger-capacity memory cards (up to 200GB) than the S5, while their glass-and-metal cases have been given smoother, rounder edges to better fit in your hand.

The main camera is brand new, sporting a slightly larger image sensor and other hardware to make it, according to Samsung, ""twice as bright and four times as fast as the one in previous models. This despite sensor resolution stepping down from 16 to 12 megapixels.

Measuring up to Apple. Samsungs highly competitive relationship with Apple becomes quite apparent with the S7 smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S7, which measures 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.3 inches, is about the same height and width as the iPhone 6s, which has a 4.7-inch display. This is the form factor Samsung believes most people will buy. The phablet-sized S7 edge has a 5.5-inch display, which is closer to that of the iPhone 6s Plus, and measures 5.9 inches x 2.9 inches x 0.3 inches. It's geared toward users who appreciate the extra screen real estate for playing games and viewing multimedia. One significant Samsung advantage: Both new phones have quad HD displays that display their subjects with several times the resolution of either iPhone.

A camera that does more with less. Samsung says the Galaxy cameras megapixel downshift from 16 megapixels (5312 x 2988 pixels) to 12 megapixels (4032 x 2268 pixels) wont be missed once people take a gander at the results of the technologies it employed to improve image quality. First, its f/1.7 aperture (compared to f/1.9 on the S 6 models) lets in about twice as much light, allowing the camera to capture images with less noise at faster shutter speeds under low-light conditions. Its also the first camera to include phase-detect autofocus on every pixel site. The advantage of phase-detect auto-focus, a technology often found on SLRs and other high-end cameras, is that the camera can focus on objects almost instantaneously. Other smartphone cameras use a hybrid autofocus technology that may incorporate phase-detect autofocus, but these, according to Samsung, arent as fast or accurate.

Water resistance. Both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge meet the ip68 standard for dust and water resistance, which means they should be able to survive a 30-minute dunk in about 5 feet of water. Thats 2 feet deeper than where many other water-resistant smartphones can venture, including the venerable Galaxy S 5. Whats more, these Galaxies protect their ports and other openings without flaps that can get in the way or get lost. Samsung said a special nanocoating and strategically placed gaskets allow these phone to stay dry while keeping ports, jacks, and speaker holes open for business.

Upgradable memory. Samsung would probably like to forget the flack it received for dropping the upgradeable storage option with the Galaxy S6 redesign. Well, thats all forgotten because both the S7 and S7 edge have room for an extra slot on their SIM tray for a microSD memory cards with up to 200 gigabytes of capacity. On the European version of these phones, the extra slot can be used for a second SIM card, which allows the phones to handle two phone numbers.

Always-on display. With all the great things smartphones can do, the things most people use them for most often are to check the time, the date, the weather and app notifications. And you can set these Galaxies to continuously show these thing after the display goes to sleep. You can easily customize what the screen shows. For instance, you can have it just show you the time, or have it flash alternating views of the calendar, time, and app notifications.

Keeping what works. We quickly scanned the menus of the demo models to make sure these Samsungs kept some of the older, lower-profile features our engineers think improve the smartphone experience. And we were glad to see that Samsung kept its ergonomic five-row keyboard with cursor control, the ability to have several app windows open at once (Multi Window), and the Smart Stay feature that keeps the display from going to sleep while youre reading it. But there was one unfortunate casualty: Glove mode, which increases display sensitivity so that you can interact with it while wearing gloves.

Availablility. These Samsungs, which come with 32GB or 64GB of internal memory, will be available on all major U.S. carriers by April.

Metro.co.uk reported that Benny, the 3-year-old pup, suddenly woke one morning unable to move his back legs. His owner, Brianna, whose last name the news website didnt disclose, rushed him to the vet, where she learned the surgery that would restore his mobility would cost her about $8,000.

Now, researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine are one step closer, having identified a distinguishing signature for the difficult-to-diagnose disease.

Existing diagnostic methods, such as the skin prick test, arent able to identify patients with active TB and those who are no longer sick, or have been vaccinated against TB. These older tests can also miss the diagnosis in patients with HIV.

Using sputum samples is a common way to test for disease-causing bacterium, but it can be difficult for patients to produce sputum on demand especially if theyre starting to get better or produce an adequate amount, making it difficult to diagnose.

The new test, detailed in a paper published February 19 in Lancet Respiratory Medicine, uses a blood sample. Stanford researchers identified three human genes whose expression changes in a consistent pattern, revealing the presence of an active TB infection, according to a news release. In a test of 1,400 human samples, researchers confirmed that the test accurately distinguished active TB, but could also be used to test patient improvement and response to treatment.

According to researchers, their test can be potentially given under relatively basic field conditions in rural and underdeveloped areas of the world any hospital should be able to administer it.

According to WHO, an estimated 9.6 million people were sickened by the infectious bacterial disease and 1.5 million people died of the disease in 2014.

One-third of the worlds population is currently infected with TB. Even if only 10 percent of them get active TB, thats still 3 percent of the worlds population  240 million people, senior author Purvesh Khatri, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, said in the news release.

Khatri is fundraising to develop the test for widespread use as both a diagnostic tool and to monitor recovery in clinical trials, which will allow for more rapid development of better and cheaper treatments.","['medicine', 'worlds', 'develop', 'simple', 'million', 'treatment', 'diagnostic', 'better', 'active', 'patients', 'blood', 'diagnosis', 'scientists', 'test', 'tb', 'researchers', 'improve']"

Throughout the year, the New Jersey-born, New York-bred pop artist toured with The Weeknd and Imagine Dragons, released her debut album Badlands, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, was featured on a track with Justin Bieber (The Feeling), and sold out a 2016 tour stop at none other than Madison Square Garden. Not bad for an emerging artist, amirite?

Another indicator of Halseys success and growing fanbase though? Her Instagram account, which currently boasts an impressive 1.5 million followers (as of December 2015, anyway). While its no surprise that fans are flocking to the New Americana singers Instagram, something tells us its not necessarily the music that keeps them coming back.

Instead it probably has something to do with the super sexy, empowering photos the curvy singer-songwriter posts on the daily, many of which feature skin, skin, and more skin. (No wonder Playboy decided to feature her in their December issue.)

Between proclamations of MOM and Slayyyy queen, the comments on Halseys Instagram posts are brimming with revelations from fans like Halsey is the reason I question my sexuality. (Yes, it would seem as though the girls selfie game is that strong.)

To cap off the bad-ass babes killer breakout year, weve painstakingly hand-selected a collection of Halseys absolute hottest Instagram snaps for you to peruse. Why? Because somebodys gotta do the tough jobs.

In 1943, his Italian immigrant parents purchased Charles Krug Winery, which dated back to 1861 when it was founded by Prussian emigrant Charles Krug. Together, with his famous brother Robert, they grew Charles Krug into one of the biggest and most well-known wineries in Napa Valley during the 1950s and '60s. Robert oversaw the business and Peter made the wines.

However, a dispute over how to run the business led Robert to leave Krug in 1965. A year later, he started Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville.

Over time, the brothers reconciled, something that was commemorated in 2005 when they made wine together for the 25th anniversary of the Napa wine auction. Robert Mondavi died in 2008.

Peter worked Charles Krug with his family and eventually assumed the role of president and CEO upon his mother's death in 1976.

In 2015 he turned the operations to his two sons, Marc and Peter Jr. when he retired, but was s till hands on in the operation until the end.

Mondavi died at his home in St. Helena, California, on the Charles Krug estate.","['mondavi', 'winery', 'krug', 'dies', 'robert', 'charles', 'wines', 'pioneer', '101', 'peter', 'napa', 'died', 'wine']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,NASA wants to unlock the universe's secrets with telescope more powerful than Hubble,[],"NASA has unveiled plans for a powerful new telescope with a view more than 100 times wider than Hubble.

The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is designed to help researchers unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the universe, according to NASA. It also will discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life, explained the space agency, in a statement released Thursday.

NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is leading the WFIRST mission, with the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. managing the 7.8 foot telescope. The Jet Propulsion Lab will also deliver the cornograph, which helps image and characterize planets around stars.

""WFIRST has the potential to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe, much the same way Hubble has,"" said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at its headquarters in Washington. ""This mission uniquely combines the ability to discover and characterize planets beyond our own solar system with the sensitivity and optics to look wide and deep into the universe in a quest to unravel the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter.""

The new telescope will survey large parts of the sky in near-infrared light, according to NASA, answering questions about the evolution of the universe and broadening our knowledge about exoplanets situated outside our solar system.

""WFIRST is designed to address science areas identified as top priorities by the astronomical community,"" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's Astrophysics Division in Washington, in the statement. ""The Wide-Field Instrument will give the telescope the ability to capture a single image with the depth and quality of Hubble, but covering 100 times the area. The coronagraph will provide revolutionary science, capturing the faint, but direct images of distant gaseous worlds and super-Earths.""

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,10 ways to deal with stress without overeating,['Julie Revelant'],"When youre stressed out, diving into a bag of chips or eating a sleeve of cookies might seem like the fastest way to feel better, and for good reason.

When stress kicks in, cortisol ramps up and makes you crave salty, sugary and fatty foods.

But the feeling is fleeting.

In fact, eating chocolate can make you happy, but the feeling disappears after just three minutes, a study in the journal Appetite found.

The good news is that with some simple strategies, you can find ways to feel better without raiding the pantry.

1. Take a mustard bath.

It sounds really strange but mustard baths, a concoction of mustard powder, baking soda and essential oils added to a warm bath, are a traditional remedy used in England for stress.

Mustard is a warming agent so it works to relax your muscles and detoxify your body, said Dr. Susan Albers, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of The New York Times-bestselling 50 More Ways To Soothe Yourself Without Food.

2. Grab a coloring book.

Coloring books for adults are trendy right now and for good reason. Just like they do for kids, the books can help improve concentration and focus, provide a form of distraction and ease stress.

3. Visualize calm.

Research shows that guided imagery can immediately change our thoughts and restore a sense of calm, said Dr. Kathleen Hall, founder and CEO of The Mindful Living Network and The Stress Institute in Atlanta, Ga.

When youre feeling stressed, imagine a real or fictional place that soothes you, or download a guided imagery app and watch your stress melt away.

4. Sleep.

If youre overworked, overwhelmed or have young children, sleep can be hard to come by. Not to mention that stress alone can disrupt sleep and lead to insomnia.

Yet falling short on just a few hours can disrupt ghrelin, the hunger hormone that regulates appetite. Plus, without enough rest, decision fatigue, sets in and were not able to make the best food choices, Albers said.

Get into bed a half an hour earlier each night and aim for 7 to 9 hours, which the National Sleep Foundation recommends as optimal.

5. Breathe in and out.

Deep breathing is proven to help foster relaxation and calm. One way to do it is the squeegee breath, which Albers recommends.

Close your eyes and imagine a squeegee running from your head down to your feet. As you breathe out, visualize that your stress is colored water coming out of your feet. Then breathe in and imagine clean water washing over your body.

6. Get crafty.

Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, taps into the frontal lobe, the part of the brain that makes decisions and executes different functions, Albers said.

Youre not only focused and concentrating on something else, but the action can help you make better decisions about food, too.

7. Fill the void.

Instead of heading to the kitchen the minute stress hits, think about what youre feeling and find an alternative way to deal with it. So if youre angry, for example, take a kickboxing class or vent to a friend on FaceTime.

8. Repeat a positive affirmation.

When youre stressed out, having a positive affirmation that you believe, such as Im strong, or Im in control, can immediately take your mind off eating, Hall said.

9. Listen to music.

People who are emotional eaters live in shame spirals, so even if theyre overweight, they continue to eat because they hate their own bodies, Hall said.

Putting on your favorite music, can help you pull yourself out of the negativity and make you feel playful, confident and relaxed and less likely to reach for food.

10. Go ahead and eat.

As long as its not your main or only source of comfort, when all else fails sometimes its OK to give in and eat. The key however, is to sit down, take your time and be mindful of every bite so you dont go overboard.

Quite the opposite, in fact.

Coming off arguably the worst season of his career -- in the first year of a five-year, $95 million contract with the Red Sox -- Sandoval was reported to have shed 20 or so pounds during the offseason. But this photo from The Boston Globe is worth a 1,000 words (or 1,000 calories):

Sandoval hit only .245/.292/.366 with 10 homers and 47 RBI in 126 games with Boston last season, well off his career norms while helping the San Francisco Giants win three World Series championships (2010, 2012, 2014).

There are contrasting reports of whether the Red Sox asked Panda to slim down during the offseason. Sandoval, whose weight was an issue while playing with the Giants and appeared to affect his defense last season with the Red Sox, told reporters Sunday that the team didn't ask him to lose any weight.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"'You're not the shooter, are you?' Witnesses describe rides with accused Michigan gunman",[],"Multiple witnesses have come forward to describe harrowing car trips Saturday night with Jason Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people and critically injuring two others during a six-hour shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Mich.

The witnesses' testimony indicates that Dalton was picking up fares in between carrying out the apparently random shootings. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Sunday that Dalton was a driver for the ride-sharing service, but did not say whether he was working Saturday night.

Matt Mellen told WWMT that he called police to report Dalton for erratic driving more than an hour before the accused shooter began firing on his targets.

Mellen said Dalton picked him up around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday and began driving very erratically after he got a phone call and hung up. He said Dalton was speeding, sideswiping cars and driving over medians and lawns. Mellen said when the vehicle came to a stop, he ran from the car and called police and also reported Dalton to Uber.

Authorities allege that Dalton shot the first victim outside of an apartment complex a little more than an hour later.

MLive reported that a Facebook post from a woman named Mackenzie Waite described an Uber driver named Jason as ""not a safe ride"". Waite, who said in the post that her fiance had booked a ride with Dalton, claimed that Dalton sideswiped a car while running a stop sign and then drove 80 miles per hour down a local street ""swerving in and out of oncoming traffic"".

Waite's post was timestampted at 5:33 p.m. Saturday, about 30 minutes before the first shooting took place. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting confirmed to MLive that law enforcement knew about the post.

Fox17 reported that a local couple, Jamie and Kacey Black saw a man jump out of a vehicle they recognized later as Dalton's. The man told them the driver had been driving erratically and would not let him out. It was not immediately clear whether the man was Waite's fiance or Mellen.

Kacey Black said she called 911 to report the driver, but said ""I felt like they didn't believe me. They just kind of laughed at me.""

At 6 p.m., a woman was shot multiple times outside an apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County. She was expected to survive.

At around 7 p.m., Dalton's next door neighbor James Block told the Associated Press that his niece saw Dalton drive out his driveway. When he got to the street, he stopped and rapidly backed toward his garage, turning his vehicle so the lights shined toward Block's house, Block said. Then he drove off.

""He was there between the shootings,"" Block said.

A Kalamazoo man with the Twitter handle IamKeithBlack posted Sunday that Dalton had given him a ride at around 8 p.m. A receipt he posted indicated that Dalton had driven him 4.8 miles and the ride had lasted 10 minutes.

About four hours after the initial shooting and 15 miles away, a man and his son were shot to death while looking at vehicles at Seelye Kia of Kalamazoo.

Then, 15 minutes later, gunfire erupted outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Four women, including retired school teacher Mary Jo Nye, were slain. A 14-year-old girl was wounded.

At around midnight, an Indiana man visiting Kalamazoo with his wife and in-laws decided to call for an Uber ride after hearing about the shooting spree. They were told their driver's name would be Jason, and he would be driving a Chevrolet HHR.

The couple, who told Fox17 they did not wish to be identified, said the driver seemed to be aware of the news about an active shooter.

""I halfheartedly joked at him and said 'You are not the shooter are you?',"" the man said, ""and he said 'no, and I said are you sure, and he said no, Im just really tired.'""

Dalton told his passengers that he had been driving for seven hours that day. The couple said they did not smell gunpowder or notice a weapon inside the car. WOOD-TV reported that the foursome were dropped off at a Radisson hotel at around 20 minutes after midnight.

About 20 minutes later, he was arrested without incident after a deputy spotted his vehicle driving through downtown Kalamazoo after leaving a bar parking lot. A semi-automatic handgun was found in the car.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"New study slams Hollywood films, TV shows over lack of diversity",[],"In one of the most exhaustive reports on diversity in Hollywood, a new study finds that the films and television produced by major media companies are ""whitewashed,"" and that an ""epidemic of invisibility"" runs top to bottom through the industry for women, minorities and LGBT people.

A study to be released Monday by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism offers one of the most wide-ranging examinations of the film and television industries, including an ""inclusivity index"" of 10 major media companies -- from Disney to Netflix -- that gives a failing grade to every movie studio and most TV makers.

Coming just days before an Academy Awards where a second straight year of all-white acting nominees has enflamed an industry-wide crisis, the report offers a new barrage of statistics that further evidence a deep discrepancy between Hollywood and the American population it entertains, in gender, race and ethnicity.

""The prequel to OscarsSoWhite is HollywoodSoWhite,"" said Stacy L. Smith, a USC professor and one of the study's authors, in an interview. ""We don't have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.""

The study, titled the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, examined the 109 films released by major studios (including art-house divisions) in 2014 and 305 scripted, first-run TV and digital series across 31 networks and streaming services that aired from September 2014 to August 2015. More than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status. Some 10,000 directors, writers and show creators were examined, as was the gender of more than 1,500 executives.

The portrait is one of pervasive underrepresentation, no matter the media platform, from CEOs to minor characters. ""Overall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,"" the study concludes.

In the 414 studied films and series, only a third of speaking characters were female, and only 28.3 percent were from minority groups -- about 10 percent less than the makeup of the U.S. population. Characters 40 years or older skew heavily male across film and TV: 74.3 percent male to 25.7 percent female.

Just 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).

""When we start to step back to see this larger ecology, I think we see a picture of exclusion,"" said Smith. ""And it doesn't match the norms of the population of the United States.""

Behind the camera, the discrepancy is even greater. Directors overall were 87 percent white. Broadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.

Just 15.2 percent of directors, 28.9 percent of writers and 22.6 percent of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap is greatest: Only 3.4 percent of the films studied were directed by women, and only two directors out of the 109 were black women: Ava DuVernay (""Selma"") and Amma Asante (""Belle"").

USC's study, which the school has been publishing in various forms for the last 10 years, also seeks to add a new metric in the conversation. The ""inclusivity index"" is a report card for the performances of 21st Century Fox, CBS, NBC Universal, Sony, the Walt Disney Co., Time Warner, Viacom, Amazon, Hulu and Netflix. Those companies encompass all the broadcast networks, most major cable channels, all of the major movie studios and three of the dominant streaming services.

Each was rated by their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters; and of female writers and directors. None of the six major studios rated better than 20 percent overall; Time Warner fared poorest of all with a score of zero. The report concludes that the film industry ""still functions as a straight, white, boy's club.""

Disney, Sony, Paramount, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. didn't immediate comment Sunday night.

Some of the same companies, however, scored better when their TV and digital offerings were evaluated. Disney, the CW, Amazon and Hulu all scored 65 percent and above.

""When we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavor is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,"" said Smith. ""They're impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive -- Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree -- those companies, if they're producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this. We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive.""","['major', 'diversity', 'tv', 'media', 'study', 'lack', 'companies', 'report', 'directors', 'slams', 'speaking', 'characters', 'films', 'hollywood', 'film', 'shows']"

""We've got to keep working, game after game,"" Atletico midfielder Koke Resurreccion said. ""We're still in second place, we'll continue fighting until the end.""

The rivals played a very tactically measured game in the first half, neither gaining nor giving up much, both being unable to crack the opposing defense, and it proved to be more of the same after the break.

In the 25th week of First Division Spanish soccer action, both capital squads - Atletico and Real Madrid - have 13 more games in which to try and catch up to Barcelona, with its eight consecutive Liga victories and 63 points, eight points out in front of Atletico.

Real Madrid is in third place with 54 points and Villarreal is in fourth with 49. EFE","['00', 'liga', 'villarreal', 'madrid', 'second', 'battles', 'game', 'unable', 'place', 'result', 'atletico', 'soccer', 'points']"
foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Pluto's moon could have been home to subsurface ocean,[],"Plutos largest moon Charon may have once had a subsurface ocean that long ago became frozen and expanded.

As a result, the expanding ocean that was identified through images from NASAs New Horizons mission may have pushed out the moons surface  causing it to stretch and fracture on a massive scale, NASA said.

The side of Charon viewed by the passing New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015 is characterized by a system of pull apart tectonic faults, which are expressed as ridges, scarps and valleysthe latter sometimes reaching more than 4 miles deep. Charons tectonic landscape shows the landscape expanded in the past and the frozen ocean is the most likely cause.

Scientists have long known that Charons outer layer was primarily water ice. But when the moon was young, this layer was warmed by the decay of radioactive elements, as well as Charons own internal heat of formation  warm enough to cause the ice to melt and form a subsurface ocean.

As Charon cooled over time, this ocean would have frozen and expanded.

In the image featured here, the top segment focuses on a section informally named Serenity Chasma, part of a vast equatorial belt of chasms on Charon. This system of chasms is one of the longest seen anywhere in the solar system, running at least 1,100 miles long and reaching 4.5 miles deep. By comparison, the Grand Canyon is 277 miles long and just over a mile (1.6 kilometers) deep.

In honor of her special day, we've rounded up all the times this past year Crawford has stunned us with her sexy physique and proved that age is nothing but a number.

That time she re-created a commercial she filmed in her 20's.

In 1992, Crawford, who was in her early 20s at the time, starred in a Pepsi Super Bowl commercial. The brunette beauty re-created the iconic ad earlier this month with James Corden for ""The Late Late Show."" Needless to say, she looked just as beautiful in her tight-fitting top and short denim shorts two decades later.

As Pepsi puts it, ""New look, same great taste.""

A paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience Monday identifies a period from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age, spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere.

The research highlights key climactic changes that began around 1500 years ago, significantly impacting history. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil, it explained. The studys authors cited, for example, the Justinian plague that ravaged the Byzantine Empire, the Sasanian Empire in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region in 541 and 542 AD.

Related: Climate change didn't force Vikings to abandon Greenland, scientists say

The researchers also identified movements out of the Asian Steppe and the Arabian peninsula, as well as the spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China as the result of a cooler climate.

The studys lead author Ulf Buntgen is head of the Dendroecology Group at the Swiss Federal Institute. Dendroecology is the scientific study of tree rings.

Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia, explained the scientists, in their paper. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD.

Related: Early man's actions caused global warming, study says

By spewing sulfur, volcanic eruptions can increase reflection of solar radiation back into space, cooling the Earths atmosphere. The cooling temperatures following the sixth-century eruptions were probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, according to the researchers.

Scientists are using climate to gain insight into key periods in history.

Last year, for example, a report published in the journal Science Advances challenged the long-held theory that Vikings settled on Greenland during warmer temperatures during the so-called Medieval Warm Period. Researchers analyzed chemical isotopes in boulders that were left by advancing glaciers over the last 1,000 years in Southwestern Greenland and nearby Baffin Island.","['antique', 'little', 'volcanic', 'eruptions', 'vikings', 'shaped', 'sixth', 'age', 'climate', 'ice', 'late', 'say', 'greenland', 'temperatures', 'human', 'scientists', 'studys', 'cooling', 'study', 'history']"

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Radical New LG G5 Smartphone has Swap-In Modules,[],"How great would it be if a state-of-art smartphone you love today could be easily upgraded to keep up with the advances of tomorrow? Thats sort of the the idea behind the new LG G5, which has an ammo-clip-style removable bottom that allows you to swap in new audio or camera hardware in just a few seconds. This isnt as dramatic as the modular phone proposed by Google's Project Ara, whose every part can exchanged like Lego blocks. But it does offer an intriguing portal in which LG and third-party accessory makers can introduce significant, hardware-based upgrades that go beyond the traditional battery replacements and wireless charging options.

This modular design is just one of the compelling new features on LGs latest update to the flagship G series announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.

Here are the details on the new LG G5.

A new look and feel. The G5, which trades in the mildly elastic, plastic-backed design of its G-series predecessors for a sleeker, unibody glass-and-aluminum body, has a dual-lens camera for handling zoom shots with greater clarity.

The LG G5 is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor that promises 64-bit performance and has an integrated X12 modem that supports LTE download speeds of up to 600 megabits per second (Mbps). Thats lots of oomph, but it's a bit wasted on many customers, because in the United States the LTE download speeds of the major carriers are only about 10Mbps.

The G5 is virtually the same size as the G4, measuring 5.9 inches x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, but it has a smaller display (5.3 inches vs. 5.5 inches). Its quad HD resolution is the same (2560x1440 pixels) as the previous phone's, which means it presents photos, videos, and web pages with more than 500 pixels per inch of detail.

Easy and elegant accessory upgrades. Unlike the clunky aftermarket accessories that can make your phone look like a failing science project, the swappable modules on the LG G5 look like they're a natural part of the phone, as if that's how the phone came from the factory. And they might as well be factory components because they plug directly into the phone's core systems. What's more, they open the door to new speakers, data ports, physical controls and other improvements that would otherwise require the purchase of a new phone.

Case in point is the LG Cam Plus camera module option that will launch with the new LG G5. It comes with dedicated buttons for operating the shutter, flash, and zoom functions as well as an 1,100mAh battery that the phone will use first, before accessing the primary 2,800mAh battery.

Another module is the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O (Bang & Olufsen) PLAY, which LG says Bang & Olufsen helped engineer, to improve the audio quality of music, whether the files are on the phone, or streamed from external files such as a PC. In addition to the 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC upsampling technology (also on the LG V10) that purportedly adds depth to marginal-quality music, this module supports high-definition audio playback. It can be used either as a module with the LG G5 or as a separate Hi-Fi audio component by connecting it to any smartphone or PC. The module has its own headphone jack.

LG says more modules are on the way.



Wide-view camera. Its a fact that telescoping zoom lenses generally produce better images than digital-zoom schemes, which only magnify images that may not be that good in the first place. But theyre bulky, so you wont find them on most smartphones except, perhaps, on the Asus Zoom smartphone we saw at CES 2016, which cleverly squeezes one into its interior.

The main 16-megapixel camera on the LG G5 addresses the zoom challenge using two lenses: One has a 78-degree viewing angle for tight shots, while the other has a 135-degree viewing angle to capture more of whats happening on the periphery. (LG says the viewing angle of the 135-degree lens is about 1.7 times wider than those of existing smartphone cameras and 15 degrees wider than the human eyes field of view, which means the camera will capture scenery youd normally miss.) The camera automatically switches between them as you zoom in and out of a shot. This feature seemed to work well with still photos. What remains to be seen is how smooth the zoom transitions when you're shooting movies.

The camera also has a setting to automatically snap a picture as soon as its circuitry detects your subjects' faces.



Quick-charge battery. A 24-hour plus battery life is one of the G-series' great strengths, reached with the assistance of the phones' capacious 3,000mAh batteries. Alas, the G5s battery 2,800mAh battery holds less energy, but LG assured us it will still provide at least a full day of talk time. Our engineers, of course, will check this claim. The battery does support rapid charging, which LG says means the phone can be full charged 27 percent faster than earlier models could.

Always-on display. The LG G5 display has an always-on feature that shows the time, date, and battery status continuously when the display goes to sleep. Though not an must-have feature, this could could spare you from rudely handling your phone during a meeting to check on such things.

Availability. The LG G5 is expected to launch at all the major carriers this spring. It will come in silver, titanium, gold, and pink finishes. No info yet on pricing.

Well have more on this exciting phone in the coming weeks.

foxnews,2016-02-12 00:00:00,Birds might be purposely starting wildfires in Australia,[],"Two species of birds might be deliberately starting wildfires in Australia, the Tech Times reports. This might seem outlandish, but cultural geographer Mark Bonta tells Newsweek it's ""standard knowledge"" among the aboriginal community and firefighters in northern Australia.

According to the Washington Post, birds of prey are known to hunt around the edges of wildfireswhich force small animals to flee their hiding placesbut those fires don't always start where the food is.

That's why brown falcons and black kites are apparently picking up burning sticks and dropping them elsewhere to start new fires. Bob Gosford, a lawyer who works with Australia's aboriginal people, has collected 15 accounts of birds starting fires, a behavior that is referenced in at least one old aboriginal ceremony.

He and Bonta of Penn State are working on getting their findings published in a peer-reviewed journal. If the pair can prove that birds are starting fires, it ""would force us to rewrite what we know,"" Bonta tells Newsweek.

It's been taken for granted that either humans or lightning cause wildfires. The change would mean birds, not humans, may have been responsible for the fires that cleared the savannas.

It would also open the possibility that humans learned to control fire by watching birds. ""The birds arent starting fires from scratch, but its the next best thing,"" Bonta tells the Post.

""Fire is supposedly so uniquely human."" Bonta admits their findings won't be accepted by the scientific community until they have video of the birds' behavior. That's why they're asking people around the world to keep an eye out for fire-starting birds and to have their cameras handy.

(Speaking of surprising animal behavior, one aquarium taught an asthmatic otter to use an inhaler.)

The Haas F1 Team released photos of its first Formula One machine Sunday morning, the VF-16. French racing driver Romain Grosjean and his Mexican teammate Esteban Gutierrez will use the car to race for points in the team's inaugural season this year.

From an international standpoint, Formula One is the highest echelon of racing, and Haas Automation builds the highest-quality machine tools, said team founder Gene Haas. When you hear F1 you know exactly what it is  a global racing series that showcases the latest technology and attracts the best talent in engineering and design. Haas Automation has an excellent reputation in the United States and I want that reputation to grow worldwide. Connecting Haas Automation with F1 in name and in practice is the best way to grow our business and elevate Haas Automation to a premium, global brand.

Just as Haas Automations products continually evolve, becoming better and more efficient, our methodology behind the VF-16 was to make it the best evolution of a good F1 car, said team principal Guenther Steiner. Were a new team, so we looked at what the successful teams were doing to give us a baseline of the direction we needed to go with our design.

We have very experienced designers who worked hard to develop all the little things from an aerodynamic perspective that, collectively, add up to a lot. And our technical partner, Ferrari, provided our power unit, and that really defined the rear end of the car and how big it needed to be.

Our goal with this car is to score points. First, we need to go out there and show that we can do the job, that we can finish races, that we are respected by the fans and other teams in the paddock. Then, we want to score points. That is the ultimate goal.

Grosjean and Gutierrez will alternate turns behind the wheel during this week's four-day test at Barcelona, with Grosjean driving on Monday and Wednesday and Gutierrez on Tuesday and Thursday.

At the second Barcelona test from March 1-4, Gutierrez will be behind the wheel for the first two days while Grosjean will be at the controls to finish it off.

foxnews,2016-02-11 00:00:00,What caused this weird crack to appear in Michigan?,[],"A strange and sudden buckling of the earth in Michigan five years ago is now being explained as a limestone bulge, researchers reported Feb. 9.

The upheaved rock and soil was discovered after a deep boom thundered through the forest near Birch Creek on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, north of Menominee. The sound shook nearby homes with the strength of a magnitude-1 earthquake on Oct. 4, 2010, at about 8:30 a.m. Central time, residents said at the time. The next day, locals discovered a long crack atop a narrow ridge.

The crack was 360 feet long and about 5 feet deep; and the ridge was nearly 7 feet high and about 30 feet wide at its largest point. Tilted trees leaned away from the crack at about 14 degrees on either side  proof the ridge was new. Torn roots stretched for their former companions, now stranded on the other side of the crack. [See Photos of the Weird Crack and Uprooted Trees]

""It was interesting to see that the crack seemed to ignore the roots,"" said senior study author Wayne Pennington, dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan Technology University in Houghton. ""The forces were stronger than the roots.""

Based on a seismic study, the most likely explanation for the ridge is a pop-up in the upper layers of limestone beneath the clay soil, Pennington and his co-authors, all MTU students, concluded in a study published in the journal Seismological Research Letters.

If I had a hammer

Even though the researchers can't say for sure what caused the pop-up, they now have a better picture of what happened underground.

The teams surveyed the underground rock by creating sound waves with a sledgehammer. The researchers slammed a sledgehammer into a metal ball sitting on the ground, and tracked how the waves passed through the soil and rock layers below. The analysis revealed a sharp buckle in the limestone below the crack.

That picture suggested the bedrock limestone violently heaved upward when the pop-up appeared, displacing the overlying clay layer. The clay soil is about 5 feet deep along the ridge. The crack resulted from the stretching of the surface clay as it bent upward, much as a crack forms in the top of a loaf of bread as the dough rises.

The survey confirms there is no earthquake fault underlying the ridge. Besides, it would take a tremendous earthquake to move the rock and soil several vertical feet, Pennington said.

Pop goes the bedrock

Pop-ups are common in quarries in eastern North America, where rock removal releases pent-up strain in the underlying rocks. Pop-ups also appear after glaciers retreat; however, the last glaciers retreated from Menominee 11,000 years ago, and there is no quarrying in the area.

Rocks in the area are squeezed by plate tectonics, the researchers said. The Midwest is under pressure from squeezing coming from the West Coast and the East Coast.

Yet the region is not experiencing increased stress that would result in future larger earthquakes, Pennington added. The pop-up appeared in the uppermost bedrock, whereas large earthquakes strike miles deep. There have been two moderate earthquakes in Michigan since 2010, which were in different areas and unrelated to the crack, the scientists said.

One final clue was the loss, to lightning, of a giant white pine tree in the week before the crack appeared. ""The timing is remarkable, and it leads us to be suspicious, but the tree weighed less than a fully loaded dump truck,"" Pennington told Live Science.

""The earth is still full of surprises,"" Pennington said. ""It's just a little surprise, but it's still interesting and we're always learning more.""

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Tensions rising on DMZ, North Korean officer tells AP",[],"Tensions have increased significantly along the Demilitarized Zone since North Korea's recent nuclear test and rocket launch, a North Korean military official told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that while he could not comment on operational details, ""the reality is that it is touch and go.""

Though parts of the world's most fortified border can seem like a tourist trap, drawing throngs of camera-happy visitors on both sides every year, to the military-trained eye the Cold War-style standoff along the 257-kilometer (160-mile) DMZ  established when the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty  is an incident waiting to happen.

That's now truer than ever, the North Korean officer said, as tensions are escalating between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington. Thousands of U.S. troops are deployed in South Korea and units based around the DMZ have the motto ""Be Ready to Fight Tonight.""

""People come here and they think it's like a resort. But if you know it better, you know how dangerous it is,"" Lt. Col. Nam Dong Ho of the North Korean People's Army said in Panmunjom, the truce village where the armistice was signed.

Nam said tensions have increased significantly since the nuclear test in January and rocket launch earlier this month. ""Something could happen at any time,"" he said.

To stand on the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone is almost otherworldly.

After crossing through military checkpoints and passing roadside concrete structures rigged to detonate and keep any vehicles from passing  defenses that are also common in the South  the air is peaceful and fresh, and birds can be heard chirping as they fly over a carefully manicured landscape dotted with rock monuments and meticulously maintained historical buildings.

But closer to the Demarcation Line that marks the actual border, soldiers stand rigidly on guard, armed and intimidating, often just a few steps away from their South Korean counterparts.

On Monday, the surreal feeling at the Demarcation Line was heightened by the absence of anyone  soldiers or civilians  visible on the South's side.

South Korea halted tours to its side of the DMZ the day after the Jan. 6 nuclear test, when it also announced it would resume cross-border propaganda broadcasts, which have in the past brought strong recriminations from North Korea. The tours have gradually resumed. A popular observatory where people can catch a glimpse into the North via binoculars was set to reopen Tuesday.

Along with restarting the broadcasts, South Korean President Park Geun-hye responded to the North's nuclear test and launch by shutting down a joint industrial park in Kaesong, a city just north of the DMZ, and telling the South Korean National Assembly that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesn't change his ways his regime will surely collapse  predictably outraging the North.

North Korea reacted by putting the industrial park under military control, cutting off emergency hotlines with Seoul and  through its state-run media  accusing Park of being a traitor and a ""senile granny.""

""I don't even want to utter her name,"" Nam said. ""I'm just a soldier so I don't know how the situation has changed. But as the Kaesong industrial zone has been totally closed by South Korea, our people and army are getting more enraged.""

Nam said the broadcasts cannot be heard in Panmunjom during the day, which he suggested was because the South doesn't want them to be heard by South Korean tourists.

""But when it's quiet, late at night, you can hear them here,"" he said.

North Korea says it is developing nuclear weapons for self-defense and has the sovereign right to launch satellites as part of a peaceful space program. But both are generally seen as violating longstanding United Nations resolutions. The U.N. Security Council is still discussing its response, but the United States, Japan and South Korea have already announced new sanctions on the already-heavily sanctioned North.

The standoff is likely to get worse before it gets better.

Keeping its own military profile high, the United States flew four stealth F-22 fighter jets over South Korea and reaffirmed it maintains an ""ironclad commitment"" to the defense of its ally after the rocket launch. Last month, it sent a nuclear-capable B-52 bomber over South Korea following the North's nuclear test.

South Korea and the United States are expected to hold large-scale war games next month.

South Korea's defense minister has said about 15,000 U.S. troops will take part in the annual exercises, double the number Washington normally sends. The two countries have also begun preparatory talks to deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in South Korea.

That is strongly opposed by neighboring powers China and Russia, since the radar would allow Washington to reach well into their territory as well.

Nam, the North Korean officer, said he remains focused on his duties. But he added that, now that North Korea says it has an H-bomb  a claim disputed by some outside experts  the U.S. might be better advised to focus on negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War.

""On the international stage, the U.S. talks about peace,"" he said. ""But it should not interfere in the affairs of other countries.""","['korea', 'north', 'launch', 'tensions', 'park', 'korean', 'ap', 'united', 'rising', 'officer', 'nuclear', 'test', 'military', 'dmz', 'tells', 'south']"

Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app

Its weird. The Pope is thought to be a third rail of politics. Fighting with the Pope is a loser. At least it has been.

Not any more.

The Pope criticized Donald Trump, without actually using his name. But the Popes remarks were clear. Someone who builds a wall and not bridges is not Christian. The statement came while the Pope was in Mexico right at the U.S. border in response to a question about Donald Trumps plan to build a wall.

Theres been some quibbling about the meaning of the full quote, the entire paragraph of words Pope Francis spoke, in which he confessed a less than full understanding of what Donald Trump has said or proposed.

But the headline was the headline: Wall Builder Donald Trump Isnt A Christian.

Trump responded that it was disgraceful for the Pope to question his Christianity.

Republican candidates running against Donald Trump ducked. Sorry, gotta run, forgot to feed the cat.

The Vatican hastened to clarify the Popes remarks, saying it was not a personal attack, and the Pope doesnt involve himself in politics.

Later, Trump softened his tone, saying he doesnt like fighting with the Pope.

With both retreating to their respective corners, its fair to wonder who won that round?

Weirdly, it seems to be Trump. Social media exploded with pictures of the massive walls surrounding the Vatican, and noted Trump bashers like George Will took the opportunity to note the Pope frequently jumps into political matters on the liberal side, and he should butt out. In all, it seems the fisticuffs with the Pope didnt hurt Donald Trump and might have helped him, at least in the short run.

Nobody wins wars with the Pope, at least not for the last few centuries.

Three U.S. government agencies will team up to study whether artificial turf fields and playgrounds that use bits of recycled tires are exposing children to dangerous chemicals.

Limited studies have not shown an elevated health risk from playing on fields with the bits of recycled tires, known as tire crumb, but more comprehensive research is needed.

Artificial turf playing fields have become a popular alternative to grass fields for their durability, lower long-term cost and ease of maintenance.

U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Bill Nelson called on the Obama administration to conduct a comprehensive study on whether the rubber poses a health hazard.

In their letter, they cited research from a University of Washington soccer coach who found 153 reported cases of cancer involving athletes who spend significant periods of time playing on crumb rubber turf.

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Why I agree with Apple and @tim_cook,['Erick Erickson'],"Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent website.



A federal magistrate in California has ordered Apple to rewrite iPhone software to allow a government backdoor into your phone.

We live in a day and age when hackers have infiltrated the American governments computers routinely and stolen confidential information. Hackers prey on Android devices, Blackberries, etc. They steal information, add malware, and spy. Resourceful hackers can take over phones audio and cameras to spy with greater detail.

Apple has taken an approach with its iPhones to make them as secure for consumers as possible. Software is sandboxed, meaning various software on your phone cannot interact with each other. Fingerprint reader codes are stored on the phone and are not able to connect to the internet or other systems. Apples phones are very secure. They keep hackers out. They run reliably.

But because the phones keep hackers out, they make it harder for the government to break in during an emergency.

In the case at hand, one of the San Bernardino terrorists used an iPhone and the government wants access. Apple has given the government what it can give, but has not given direct access to the phone because it is not in Apples powers to give it. They designed the phone that way. They did not design a phone for terrorists, they designed a phone for consumers in an unsafe world where even super secure government servers can get hacked.

The federal magistrate wants Apple to redesign its software to make it less secure, less safe, and more easily hackable. Today, in an open letter, Apple is declining to do so. I agree with Apple.

There are lots of terrible people out there from terrorists to child pornographers who might want an iPhone because they think the government will not be able to get access. But there are vastly more people out there who want to hack into my phone.

The government cannot keep its own servers secure. If the government gets a backdoor to my phone, it will not be able to keep the backdoor to itself.

I support Apples relentless pursuit of consumer privacy. Bad people are always going to do bad things. But good people should not see their privacy reduced as a result.

In the wake of Tim Cook penning a letter warning of the dangerous precedent that would be set if Apple acquiesced to the court order in question, McAfee stepped up to the plate with an offer to decrypt the terrorist's iPhone 5c free of charge.

DON'T MISS: Legendary iPhone hacker weighs in on Apple's war with the FBI

In an op-ed posted to BusinessInsider Thursday, McAfee said that the FBI's demand, coupled with the corresponding court order, marks the ""end of the US as a world power.""

""No matter how you slice this pie, if the government succeeds in getting this back door, it will eventually get a back door into all encryption, and our world, as we know it, is over,"" McAfee added. ""In spite of the FBI's claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that's impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government. Then a few million dollars, some beautiful women (or men), and a yacht trip to the Caribbean might be all it takes for our enemies to have full access to our secrets.""

Okay, there's nothing too wild just yet, but this is McAfee we're talking about so you might want to buckle up.

Later on in his op-ed, McAfee says that he works the best hackers in the business, ""prodigies"" he calls them. Working together, McAfee claims that his motley crew of hackers, relying primarily upon social engineering techniques, would be able to break iPhone encryption in just three weeks.

""I would eat my shoe on the Neil Cavuto show if we could not break the encryption on the San Bernardino phone. This is a pure and simple fact.""

""So here is my offer to the FBI. I will, free of

charge, decrypt the information on the San Bernardino phone, with my team. We will primarily use social engineering, and it will take us three weeks. If you accept my offer, then you will not need to ask Apple to place a back door in its product, which will be the beginning of the end of America.""","['bernardino', 'promises', 'door', 'san', 'vows', 'tv', 'encryption', 'offer', 'mcafee', 'live', 'shoe', 'social', 'world', 'john', 'eat', 'apples', 'iphone']"

The evidence comes from a series of scrapes that were uncovered in 100 million year old Dakota sandstone at four sites in western Colorado. These ancient scrapes from Cretaceous therapods are similar to a behavior known as nest scrape display or scrape ceremonies among modern birds, where males show off their ability to be good mates by digging up pseudo nests for their prospective partners.

Related: Ancient marine reptiles flew through the water

These are the first sites with evidence of dinosaur mating display rituals ever discovered, and the first physical evidence of courtship behavior, Lockley, a University of Colorado Denver geology professor and a co-author on a study of the findings in Scientific Reports Thursday, said in a statement. These huge scrape displays fill in a missing gap in our understanding of dinosaur behavior.

Related Image Expand / Contract Team leader Martin Lockley (right) and co-author (Ken Cart) kneel beside two large Cretaceous-age scrapes from western Colorado that are the first physical-reported evidence that large theropod dinosaurs engaged in courtship behavior. (M. Lockley )

Lockley, who also is a world-renowned expert on dinosaur footprints, found evidence of more than 50 dinosaur scrapes, some as large as bathtubs, in an area where tracks of carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs have also been confirmed. The display arenas, also called leks were found in two National Conservation Areas (Dominguez-Escalante and Gunnison Gorge) on property permitted by the Bureau of Land Management near

Evidence of mating areas were also discovered by Lockley at Dinosaur Ridge, a National Natural Landmark, just west of Denver.

Related: These dinosaurs liked to get their feet wet

Since it was logistically difficult to remove the scrapes, the researchers turned to technology for help. They created 3-D images of the scrapes using a technique of layering photographs called photogrammetry. They also made rubber molds and fiberglass copies of the scrapes  which are being stored at the Denver Museum.

Until now, theories abounded about dinosaur sex including that it was driven by sexual selection and the idea that male dinosaurs in prehistoric times looked for mates and drove off weaker rivals. Females, meanwhile, would have selected the biggest and strongest mates  much as we see in the animal kingdom today.

The problem was there was no physical evidence  until now.

The scrapes, which the researchers believe were most likely associated with territorial activity during the breeding season, demonstrate that the mating behavior is similar to birds - which makes sense since they are descended from dinosaurs.

The scrape evidence has significant implications, Lockley said. This is physical evidence of pre-historic foreplay that is very similar to birds today. Modern birds using scrape ceremony courtship usually do so near their final nesting sites. So the fossil scrape evidence offers a tantalizing clue that dinosaurs in heat may have gathered here millions of years ago to breed and then nest nearby.

Related: 'The Good Dinosaur': Could humans and dinos coexist?

Initially, the authors considered several possible reasons for the scrapes  including a nesting site, territorial markings or evidence that the dinosaurs were digging for food.

They ruled out the nesting site because they found no eggs while the food theory suffers from the fact that such behavior probably would have resulted in deeper digging and pooling that would wash out scrape marks in sandy sediments.

As for the scrapes done to mark territory, the researchers said it was unlikely since this behavior is found in mammals but not known in water-conserving uricothelic reptiles and birds.

That leaves the mating behavior, which the authors said was consistently supported by the evidence and is similar to the rituals of several modern bird species including ostriches, puffins and shorebirds like Wilsons plover.

Thomas E. Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science who did not take part in the study, told FoxNews.com that the findings were interesting especially because so little is known about the mating rituals of dinosaurs.

Related: Study sheds fresh light on early relatives of dinosaurs

Williamson said that it is suspected that dinosaurs must have had a rich repertoire of behaviors related to mating and/or territoriality based on the elaborate skull ornamentation, colored plumage, and other structures that many dinosaurs have. Some were using these structures to visually recognize and communicate with others of their own species, he said, while others dinosaurs such as lambeosaurine hadrosaurs (crested duck-billed dinosaurs), probably communicated through acoustic displays using resonating tubes on their heads.

Williamson agreed that dinosaur behavior must have been similar to birds and their other closest living relatives, crocodilians. Both groups use complex behaviors for territorial and courtship displays and based on this, it is likely that dinosaurs did too.

However, this new evidence is really something special. Tracks, such as the unusual ones described in this paper, provide actual physical evidence of dinosaur activity  and similar activity appears to be present in some modern birds, he said in an email interview. This suggests that some of these behaviors can be traced far back into the dinosaurian heritage of birds.

The Interior Ministry said a raid last week in the city of El Jadida recovered weapons and bacteria-generating chemicals believed to be meant for explosives. It said the cell recruited a minor who was preparing to carry out a suicide car bomb attack this past weekend.","['week', 'dismantled', 'hotel', 'casablanca', 'islamic', 'targeted', 'islinked', 'state', 'targetsthe', 'cell', 'morocco', 'mall', 'terrorist', 'weekend', 'weapons']"

During an interview with the FOX Business Networks Trish Regan, McAfee & Associates founder John McAfee said theres a big misunderstanding regarding what the FBI actually wants from Apple.

The FBI doesnt just want to unlock that iPhone. The FBI wants Apple to change its IOS, the operating system, so that it creates a back door to all encryption. he argued.

McAfee warned that creating a back door would eventually fall into the hands of hackers and our enemies. There has never been a backdoor thats been kept secret... the Chinese will have the back door, he said.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"Samsung's Galaxy S7 gets bigger battery, roomier display, while LG innovates with G5",['Brooke Crothers'],"Samsung has updated its flagship phones with under-the-hood changes and a bigger screen, while LG has made more radical changes to its most popular phone series.

The Korean electronics giant rolled out the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Sunday at Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. Both models mark the next generation of Samsungs most popular smartphones and the next stage in its fierce rivalry with Apple.



Galaxy S7 edge: Samsung surprised with the new version of the curved-screen model by bumping up the display size to 5.5 inches from 5.1 inches. (The previous-generation Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones had both been 5.1 inches.) The display retains the same quad HD resolution as the previous generation and the same curved design that waterfalls on both sides. Samsung also tweaked the back of the phone, giving it a very slight curve to make it easier to hold.

Related: Windows 10 vs OS X

Its worth noting that with the bigger 5.5-inch display, the S7 edge is now on equal footing with the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, Apples largest smartphone.



The biggest under-the-hood change for the S7 edge is the battery, which has been increased to 3,600 mAh from 2,600. Thats a big boost and should help Samsung address the battery-life shortcomings of the S6 edge.



Galaxy S7: The 5.1-inch flat-screen S7 saw the fewest cosmetic changes. Like the S7 edge, it gets a curvier back for better ergonomics. And like the S7 edge, it also gets a bigger battery, now 3,000 mAh, up from 2,550 mAh in the S6. A bigger battery invariably makes a device heavier but thats a tradeoff Samsung is willing to make to improve battery life.

Common specs to the Galaxy S7 edge and Galaxy S7: The biggest spec change common to both phones is the camera. Though seemingly counterintuitive, Samsung actually dropped the megapixel count to 12MP in the Galaxy S7 from 16MP in the S6. But less can be more in the case of camera sensors. The pixels are now bigger and Samsung claims the larger pixels let in more light, resulting in better low-light photos. And Samsung has improved the lens too to allow more light through.



Both devices are water and dust resistant and both get Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the latest Android operating system.



The phones will be available from U.S. carriers on March 11. Pricing should be similar to the previous-generation S6 edge and S6, Samsung said.

Related: iPhone 7 rumored to wow with killer camera, reports say

LG G5: Though invariably overshadowed by Samsung, the smaller South Korean phone maker made more radical changes with the new G5 phone.



The killer feature of the slightly smaller phone (compared to the G4) is modularity. By pressing a button, the bottom of the phone slides out, which allows you to not only swap out the battery for a fresh one but add upgrade modules too. For example, there's a module for upgrading the audio and another one that adds features to the camera like better zoom and a bigger battery.



And speaking of the camera. The LG G5 has both 8- and 16-megapixel sensors on the back, located on either side of the LED flash. The secondary 8MP sensor allows wide-angle shots, according to LG.

The all-metal G5 also has some of the more expected tweaks like a faster processor and ships with Android Marshmallow.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Clinton campaign challenges Sanders' claim that he won Nevada Latino vote,[],"Hillary Clinton may decidedly have won the Nevada Caucus, but who won the states Latino vote is still in question.

Shortly after losing the Silver States caucus, Bernie Sanders campaign sent out a press release trumpeting his win with Latino voters. Entrance polls showed the Vermont senator winning the Latino vote, 53 percent to 45 percent.

Using the data collected by Edison Research for the Associated Press and the major television networks, the Vermont lawmaker said the results showed he is making major inroads among minority groups traditionally seen as part of Clintons base.

What we learned today is that Hillary Clintons firewall with Latino voters is a myth, said Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for the Sanders campaign, according to the Los Angeles Times.

A Clinton campaign report by Latino Decisions, however, said the results didnt add up and the former secretary of state balked at Sanders claim of winning the Latino vote.

We don't believe that the so-called entry polls were particularly accurate,"" Clinton said. ""Look at the precincts...Look at where we dominated.""

The Latino Decisions data shows that Clinton won the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants and in precincts 4560 and 4559, both in the crucial Clark County and over 80 percent Latino, Clinton won seven and twelve delegates to Sanders one and four.

Clinton also won all the caucuses held in the casinos, which brought in the predominantly Latino workers on break from their jobs.

The battle over the who the Latino vote in Nevada is critical as the campaign season marches on, with Sanders trying prove that his campaign has more support than just white, liberal voters and Clinton hoping to keep a broad coalition of minority voters at her side as voting turns to states like Texas, Colorado, Arizona and Florida.

Despite citing progress with Latinos in Nevada, Sanders advisers are clear-eyed about the challenges on Super Tuesday. They are mapping out plans to stay close to Clinton in the delegate count until the race turns to friendlier territory later in March.

""Because we can do the long game, once we get past March 1, the calendar changes dramatically,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""It's frontloaded for her, but we have the ability to stay in the long game.""

More than half the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination will be determined in the 28 states that hold primaries and caucuses in March.

Clinton and Sanders should have enough money to stay in the race for weeks afterward, but the delegate tally at the end of the month could make the results inevitable.

For Sanders, strong showings in March are more important because of Clinton's lead with superdelegates  the party leaders who can support any candidates regardless of how their states vote.

Clinton has captured the support of 451 superdelegates compared with Sanders' 19.

While Sanders was campaigning in South Carolina on Sunday, he planned to be in Massachusetts for a college rally and campaign in Norfolk, Virginia, on Tuesday.

Clinton also was spending time in Super Tuesday states. She flew from Nevada on Saturday to Texas, a huge delegate prize, for a late-night rally in Houston. She planned to raise money in California and then campaign in South Carolina.

Beyond Super Tuesday, Clinton and Sanders are looking ahead to the March 15 contests in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. Big wins in those states for either candidate would put the nomination within sight.

Clinton's support among black voters could pay dividends because of the way Democrats award high-performing congressional districts with a greater share of delegates.

Many of the most delegate-rich states have large minority populations, including Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois and Florida, giving Clinton an inside track to accumulate delegates in March.

Research published in the Journal of Neuroscience has revealed that concentrating on a visual task (say, scrolling through your Instagram feed) may render you temporarily deaf to normal-volume sounds (like your friends story about ... what was she talking about again?)

RELATED: Heres What Happens to Your Eyes When You Look at Multiple Screens

For the small study, researchers from the University College London analyzed the real-time brain activity of 13 volunteers as they completed visual tasks while sounds played in the background. As the tasks got harder, the brains response to sound was reduced.

The brain scans showed that people were not only ignoring or filtering out the sounds, they were not actually hearing them in the first place,  study co-author Maria Chait, PhD, explained in a press release. These findings suggest that our vision and our hearing share limited resources in the brain, which is essentially forced to choose between processing info from our eyes or our ears.

Whether you are a skeptic or not, many cruise liners provide passengers with the five-star luxury one might expect from a boutique hotel. Plus you get the added benefit of seeing several locations from the comfort of your stateroom.

Here are some of the worlds most lavish and extravagant liners afloat:

1.&nbspSilverseas Silver Shadow Silversea This small fleet of just eight ships, led by the beautiful Silver Shadow, provides travelers with a personal and indulgent voyage experience that includes Egyptian cotton sheets, Bulgari bath amenities, uniquely stocked minibars, private verandas, and personal butler service. The boats in the fleet are smaller than most, so they are able to access smaller ports all over the globe. The line is known for its spectacular annual round-the-world voyage, which sets sail in January of every year and stops in 50 ports in 30 countries over 115 days while circumnavigating the globe. And it will just set you back for the small fee of $58,950.

2.&nbspRMS Queen Mary 2 Cunard Line The Queen Mary 2 wins the prize for the most expensive cruise liner cabin in the world, costing a staggering $183,000 for the round-the-world trip. That is more than $1,600 a night. However, with 2,249 square feet of space over two floors, his and hers bathrooms, a private gym, and a large private deck, some say the price is worth it. The 2015 round-the-world trip will take in 38 ports in 22 countries.

3.&nbspRoyal Caribbeans Oasis of the Seas Royal Caribbean In 2009, Royal Caribbean International announced that it was launching the worlds most expensive cruise ship, costing an eye-popping $1.4 billion to build. The Oasis of the Seas measures 1,184 feet in length, stands 18 decks tall, and has a crew of 2,394 to tend to 5,400 passengers. But it is the ships amenities that make it spectacular. The boat comes equipped with a football-field-size park with more than 12,000 trees and plants, an AquaTheatre with seating for 600 people, two rock-climbing walls, two FlowRider Surf Simulators, a zipline, a 600-meter running track, a large main theater, and a full-service spa, just to name a few.

4.&nbspSeaDream Yacht Clubs SeaDream I and II SeaDream Yacht Club SeaDream has two luxury mega yachts (as they like to call them), which can hold up to 56 couples and 95 crew each, providing luxury, privacy, and pampering to its guests in a setting that is more intimate than big-ship sailing provides. The five-star service sees passengers waited on hand and foot; treated to award-winning gourmet cuisine and fine wines; and given access to a fitness center and a variety of water sports activities, including kayaks, paddle boards, snorkeling equipment, and Jet Skis.

5.&nbspCrystal Cruises the Crystal Serenity Crystal Cruises Regularly voted the worlds best cruise ship, the Crystal Serenity underwent a full refurbishment in 2013 costing $17 million. The ships interior design is inspired by the casual-yet-cultured vibe of Southern California and has unique features including a chefs herb garden, vertical walls of greenery, and a retractable glass roof in the Trident Grill. The Crystal Penthouse suite has 1,345 square feet of space, London-inspired interior design, 24-hour butler service, and a guest bathroom. The rest of the suites feature fresh flowers, Frette linens and robes, room service, and nightly turndown service.","['worlds', 'service', 'passengers', 'seas', 'seadream', 'ships', 'private', 'high', 'lavish', 'cruise', 'ports', 'roundtheworld', 'crystal']"
foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"DeRozan scores 21 to lead Raptors past Grizzlies, 98-85",[],"TORONTO (AP) DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points, Kyle Lowry added 18 and the Toronto Raptors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 98-85 Sunday night for their eighth consecutive win at home.

Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and 12 rebounds for his 13th double-double of the season. Cory Joseph scored 14 off the bench to help the Raptors rebound from consecutive losses at Minnesota and Chicago.

It was the Raptors' first home game since a Jan. 30 victory over Detroit. Toronto hosted the NBA All-Star Game last weekend.

Zach Randolph had 18 points and Mario Chalmers scored 17 for the Grizzlies. Vince Carter added 16 against his former team.

Lance Stephenson scored 16 points in his Grizzlies debut after arriving from the Los Angeles Clippers in a trade last Thursday.

Entering the fourth quarter with a 10-point deficit, Memphis missed four of its first five shots and allowed the Raptors to increase their lead to a game-high 14 on Patrick Patterson's 3-pointer with 9:10 remaining.

Though the Grizzlies closed the gap to five on a pair of occasions, Joseph's 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 1:09 left re-established the 10-point advantage and virtually ended any chance of a Memphis comeback.

Toronto led 46-43 at halftime and built on that in the third quarter behind eight points apiece from Valanciunas and DeRozan to establish a 74-64 advantage entering the final 12 minutes.

The Raptors got eight points from Lowry and 14 more off the bench in the second period and opened a 12-point lead just after the midway point. However, Memphis got 10 points from Carter, including three free throws following Terrence Ross' foul as the former Raptor star was attempting a 45-foot 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left. That closed the deficit to three at the break.

Randolph made his first three shots as Memphis jumped out to a lead off the opening tip. Toronto went ahead for the first time on a pair of free throws by DeRozan with 2:04 left in the first quarter. Joseph's 3 as time expired gave the Raptors a 22-20 edge heading into the second.

TIP-INS

Grizzlies: Carter, second on the Raptors' career scoring list with 9,420 points, reached double digits at the Air Canada Centre for the first time since putting up 17 points for Phoenix on Feb. 11, 2011. He received a rousing ovation when he entered in the first quarter. ... Carter needs eight points to pass Charles Barkley (23,757) for 24th in NBA history. ... G Tony Allen (left knee) sat out.

Raptors: DeRozan tied Chris Bosh and Morris Peterson for the most wins by a player in Raptors history (232). ... The 21 days between home games marked the longest stretch in franchise history. ... Toronto is 18-10 against teams with winning records.

foxnews,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Tom Ridge: Why Apple should reconsider on San Bernardino court order,['Tom Ridge'],"Several years ago I attended a dinner ceremony in New York honoring Americas heroes in Federal law enforcement. At the time the NSAs surveillance program was under attack in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. As I walked into the gala that night several reporters stopped me to ask for my thoughts on the NSA. My answer apparently surprised them because it ended up making headlines the next morning: Ex-Homeland Secretary says I dont want the NSA looking at my emails.

I didnt then, and I still dont. I objected to reports that an NSA surveillance program had given agency operatives the green light to look at the emails of American citizens without probable cause. It was an overreach of a program that began in the months after 9/11 when I served as advisor to the president on Homeland Security.

I share this anecdote today because it not only underscores my record of protecting privacy, it will help you to better understand why I hope Apple CEO Tim Cook will reconsider his opposition to the court order to unlock an iPhone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

Mr. Cooks open letter to Apple customers, in which he explains the companys rationale, is both thoughtful and sincere. He raises valid concerns about the dangerous precedent that would be established should Apple work with the FBI to unlock this particular phone. I would agree such a danger would exist if the federal government were asking for broad powers to unlock phones without hard evidence or approved warrants. However, that is not the case in this situation.

It is one thing for Apple to oppose, on privacy grounds, providing back doors to the FBI regarding consumer phones generally. But in this case, we know the heinous acts committed by the San Bernardino terrorists. Fourteen people were murdered. When we know that a particular individual has committed a crime  as we know here  it is a wholly different matter. It is logical to assume that there are phone numbers and other information on that iPhone that could very well lead to co-conspirators and perhaps prevent other attacks.

Earlier this month, Twitter announced it had suspended 125,000 ISIS-related accounts. Facebook has also started to take steps to help combat terrorism.

I applaud such efforts and was pleased to see that leaders of our tech giants recently agreed to sit down with administration officials to take a more proactive approach to dealing with the growing scourge of terrorism and their use of technology. This situation underscores the need for the broader tech community and government to come together to prevent known terrorists from hiding behind technology.

While I strongly believed the NSA was overreaching in its review of emails, I see no such overreach by the FBI in their investigation in California. Nor do I see a threat to Apple customers broadly  like me  who will continue to benefit from the strong privacy shields Apples programmers have developed.

I believe Mr. Cook when he says he has no sympathy for terrorists and that he thinks Apple customers will agree with his position. Yet in opposing this court order, and in the wake of events in places like Paris and San Bernardino, can terrorists now conclude they have an ally in Apple? I believe Apple customers in this instance are able to separate the need to protect their privacy with the needs of law enforcement to defend all of us from future terror attacks.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Syrian residents weary of reports on provisional truce,[],"Residents of the Syrian capital expressed skepticism on Monday about reports that a ""provisional agreement"" has been reached for a truce, a day after a wave of Islamic State bombings killed about 130 people in government-held areas near Damascus and beyond.

Details of the tentative cease-fire, announced in Jordan on Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, have not been made public. Even if a truce were to take hold, the Islamic State is not party to any such cease-fires or negotiations for a truce.

In a possible sign of some breakthrough, the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement Monday saying that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kerry spoke two more times by telephone on Sunday evening and during the course of their conversations agreed on the parameters for the cease-fire in Syria.

The statement said these parameters were then reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Barack Obama. No further details were immediately available.

Sunday's blasts that ripped through the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus and the central city of Homs were among the deadliest bombings in government-held areas in Syria's devastating five-year civil war.

The Islamic State group claimed both attacks. The extremists are dug in on the outskirts of the two cities and have repeatedly targeted pro-government strongholds.

The mood in government-controlled Damascus was weary on Monday. Inside the Hamidiyeh Souk, a popular bazaar which is typically crowded with shoppers, people said they were worried that a ceasefire would not be evenly observed and could leave the Syrian authorities vulnerable.

""I hope there will be no ceasefire. Because if there is a ceasefire, Turks will increase their support for criminals and traitors,"" said Ahmad Al-Omar from the northern Aleppo province, adding that Turkey may seek to let opposition fighters in via its border with Syria.

Others at the bazaar echoed President Bashar Assad's statements that a ceasefire could give an advantage to rebel forces and also the Islamic State group.

""I believe that those proposals now are ... a pretext to stop the advance of the Syrian army which is trying to liberate the homeland,"" said Ahmad Al-Issa.

Sunday's blasts came as Kerry announced that a ""provisional agreement"" has been reached on a cessation of hostilities that could begin in the next few days. But he acknowledged that it's not finalized and all parties might not automatically comply.

Kerry declined to go into the details of the agreement, saying it ""is not yet done.""

""The modalities for a cessation of hostilities are now being completed,"" Kerry said, adding that it was ""possible over the course of these next hours.""

The Damascus authorities said the government was ready to take part in a truce as long as it is not used by militants to reinforce their positions. Syrian troops, backed by Russian warplanes are on a major offensive in the northern Aleppo province, trying to seal the border with Turkey, a key supporter of the rebels, before any truce is reached.

Meanwhile, the Syrian government's supply route by land to the city of Aleppo was cut by heavy fighting Monday as the army, supported by allied militias and the Russian air force, fought to consolidate its recent gains in the northern province.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of contacts to monitor the war, said Islamic militias assaulted government-held positions around Khanaser, a town southeast of Aleppo, setting off intense clashes that have lasted through the day. Khanaser lies along the government's only access route to Aleppo.

Aleppo, Syria's largest city and one-time commercial center, is divided between the government and its opponents, while ISIS holds a wide front to the east of the city.

Fighting has been fierce in Aleppo province in recent weeks amid a government offensive to cut off the rebel stronghold.

The Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement on Monday condemning Sunday's bomb blasts in Damascus and Homs and calling for a ""proper, principled response"" from the international community to prevent terrorist groups from further aggravating the situation in Syria and inciting sectarian strife.

""The brutal crimes by extremists are aimed at intimidating the civilian population and undermining attempts to achieve a lasting political settlement of the Syrian crisis in the interests of all Syrians and efforts to end the violence and bloodshed,"" the Russian statement said.

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"US, North Korea agreed to peace talks before latest nuclear test",[],"Days before North Koreas latest nuclear-bomb test, the Obama administration secretly agreed to talks to try to formally end the Korean War, dropping a longstanding condition that Pyongyang first take steps to curtail its nuclear arsenal.

Instead the U.S. called for North Koreas atomic-weapons program to be simply part of the talks. Pyongyang declined the counter-proposal, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. Its nuclear test on Jan. 6 ended the diplomatic gambit.

The episode, in an exchange at the United Nations, was one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obamas second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.

The State Department on Sunday acknowledged the U.S. exchange with North Korea, saying it took place in accordance with longstanding U.S. goals.

To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty. We carefully considered their proposal, and made clear that denuclearization had to be part of any such discussion, said spokesman John Kirby, adding the North rejected it. Our response to the North Korean proposal was consistent with our longstanding focus on denuclearization.

Mr. Obama has pointed to the Iran deal to signal to North Korea that he is open to a similar track with the regime of Kim Jong Un. But the White House sees North Korea as far more opaque and uncooperative. The latest fruitless exchanges typified diplomacy between the U.S. and Pyongyang in recent years.

Since taking power at the end of 2011, Mr. Kim has stepped up the Norths demands for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, 63 years after it ended with an armistice. Many analysts see the move as an attempt to force the removal of the U.S. military in the South. The U.S. insists denuclearization must have priority, and said that has to be part of any peace talks, even while dropping the precondition that North Korea first take steps that show a willingness to give up its nuclear program.

Pyongyang rejects that. For North Korea, winning a peace treaty is the center of the U.S. relationship, said Go Myung-hyun, an expert on North Korea at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul-based think tank. It feels nuclear development gives it a bigger edge to do so.

The international reaction to North Koreas January nuclear test and follow-up rocket launch this month was swift, with Japan imposing new penalties on Pyongyang, South Korea closing an inter-Korean industrial park that had filled the Norths coffers and American lawmakers passing a bill to tighten economic sanctions against the regime. Mr. Obama signed the bill into law last Thursday.

Aaron J. Eidem, 37, was struck by his own Toyota Avalon, after the parked car was hit by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 44 just west of Springfield, Mo., where Eidem resided. Eidem had pulled over to help a motorist move a disabled vehicle from the inside shoulder of the highway to the right shoulder, which was deemed a safer spot to change a tire, an officer at the scene told the Springfield News-Leader.

He was a good Samaritan, Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said. He stopped and was helping a vehicle with a flat tire.

After hitting Eidems car, the tractor-trailer hit another vehicle, which then collided with a second tractor-trailer. No other injuries were reported, however.

Officials told FoxNews.com on Monday morning that no charges were anticipated in connection with the crash.



A U.S. Army captain, Eidem was also an assistant professor of military science at Missouri State University.

He served his country for almost 20 years as a military police officer and instructor, Dean of the College of Health and Human Services Victor Matthews wrote in a statement. He deployed to combat three times, earning the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.

Matthews described Eidem as a highly respected leader developer.","['shoulder', 'heart', 'combat', 'earned', 'purple', 'veteran', 'stranded', 'told', 'eidem', 'helping', 'stopped', 'motorist', 'vehicle', 'tractortrailer', 'struck', 'military', 'killed', 'springfield', 'officer']"

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Sleep apnea may be bad for kidneys,[],"Having sleep apnea may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease, according to a report from Taiwan.

Researchers analyzed data from 2000 through 2010 on 8,600 adults diagnosed with sleep apnea and four times as many adults of similar age, sex and monthly income without sleep apnea, using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.

They found 157 new cases of chronic kidney disease among people with sleep apnea and 298 cases in the comparison group, according to Yung-Tai Chen of Taipei City Hospital Heping Fuyou Branch in Taiwan and coauthors.

After taking other health factors into account, sleep apnea increased the risk of kidney disease by 58%. By comparison, hypertension (a known risk factor for kidney disease) increased the risk by 17%. Diabetes was a stronger predictor than both other factors, more than doubling the risk of kidney disease, the research team reported online February 1 in Respirology.

Intermittent low oxygen levels during the night and fragmented sleep patterns may activate higher blood pressure, which would damage the kidneys and could make individuals more susceptible to chronic kidney disease, said Tetyana Kendzerska of the University of Toronto Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, who was not part of the study in Taiwan.

But, ""the findings from this study are limited by lack of information on sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease severity given that these conditions were defined through the health administrative data,"" Kendzerska said.

Factors like obesity and smoking status are also important for kidney risk but were not included in the assessment, she told Reuters Health by email.

""So, instead of concluding that sleep apnea has the same impact as high blood pressure on the kidney, I would rather conclude that this study suggests that the association between sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease may exist,"" and should be validated with more powerful studies, she said.

Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night which may decrease high blood pressure and mitigate kidney risk, Kendzerska said.

""These findings raise the issue of whether the relationship between sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease is unidirectional or bidirectional,"" she said. ""If the importance of sleep apnea and preventive effect of treatment will be confirmed in further studies, sleep apnea should be added to the list of modifiable risk factors considered in (chronic kidney disease) risk assessment.""

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Raptors-Knicks Preview,[],"Two lackluster efforts around Toronto's hosting of All-Star festivities were enough to convince the Raptors to get back to business and buckle down defensively.

After accomplishing that goal while avoiding their longest losing streak in three months, they're hoping to build on it in their first visit to Madison Square Garden.

Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan look to continue their success in this series Monday night when the Atlantic Division leaders try to avoid a season high-tying third straight road loss and deny the Knicks their first back-to-back wins in more than a month.

Toronto ranks in the NBA's top five with 97.7 points allowed per game, but that solid defense didn't show up in a 117-112 loss at Minnesota on Feb. 10 prior to the break or a 116-106 road defeat to a previously struggling Chicago team on Friday.

That changed Sunday, however, when the Raptors (36-18) held Memphis to 36.8 percent shooting, including 3 for 20 from 3-point range, in a 98-85 home victory.

""For sure, it felt like that,"" said Lowry, who played with DeRozan in his second All-Star Game on Feb. 14 at Air Canada Centre. ""...But now we're back to winning ways.""

Toronto avoided its first three-game losing streak since Nov. 15-18 with its 15th victory in 18 games. DeRozan scored 21 in the team's first home game since Jan. 30 and Jonas Valanciunas had his second straight double-double with 10 points and 12 boards.

""Everyone's knees were bent, down in the stance, ready to play and out of the vacation mode I think,"" coach Dwane Casey said. ""I think the whole league has to get used to that long week of time off and get back into game shape, get the sea legs back, get the mentality back.""

Casey's club will try to stay focused on defense against New York, which has shot 50 percent or better in two of its past three but has a 42.8 mark while dropping 11 of 13.

The Knicks (24-33) hit at a 50.6 percent clip Saturday to snap a season-high seven-game losing streak with a 103-95 win at Minnesota. Carmelo Anthony led the way with 30 points and Robin Lopez matched season highs with 26 points and 16 rebounds.

New York outrebounded Minnesota 51-31 and led by 24 in the fourth quarter en route to giving interim coach Kurt Rambis his first win in three games since taking over for the fired Derek Fisher.

Anthony's sore knee seems to be improving as the All-Star forward is averaging 28.3 points and 10.3 rebounds while playing at least 37 minutes in the last three games. He's played well when he's been able to go against Toronto, scoring 30.6 per game over his last seven meetings.

""Whatever I got to do to get these wins up I'm going to do it,"" Anthony said.

Anthony finished with 25 points to key a 111-109 win at Toronto on Nov. 10 before having to sit out last month's meeting when Arron Afflalo scored 20 in a 103-93 loss north of the border.

Lowry has totaled 49 points in the season series, while DeRozan has scored 55.

DeRozan can pass Chris Bosh and Morris Peterson with a franchise-record 233rd win in a Toronto uniform.","['streak', 'toronto', 'scored', 'loss', 'win', 'minnesota', 'season', 'derozan', 'game', 'points', 'raptorsknicks', 'preview']"

Now, researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine are one step closer, having identified a distinguishing signature for the difficult-to-diagnose disease.

Existing diagnostic methods, such as the skin prick test, arent able to identify patients with active TB and those who are no longer sick, or have been vaccinated against TB. These older tests can also miss the diagnosis in patients with HIV.

Using sputum samples is a common way to test for disease-causing bacterium, but it can be difficult for patients to produce sputum on demand especially if theyre starting to get better or produce an adequate amount, making it difficult to diagnose.

The new test, detailed in a paper published February 19 in Lancet Respiratory Medicine, uses a blood sample. Stanford researchers identified three human genes whose expression changes in a consistent pattern, revealing the presence of an active TB infection, according to a news release. In a test of 1,400 human samples, researchers confirmed that the test accurately distinguished active TB, but could also be used to test patient improvement and response to treatment.

According to researchers, their test can be potentially given under relatively basic field conditions in rural and underdeveloped areas of the world any hospital should be able to administer it.

According to WHO, an estimated 9.6 million people were sickened by the infectious bacterial disease and 1.5 million people died of the disease in 2014.

One-third of the worlds population is currently infected with TB. Even if only 10 percent of them get active TB, thats still 3 percent of the worlds population  240 million people, senior author Purvesh Khatri, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, said in the news release.

Khatri is fundraising to develop the test for widespread use as both a diagnostic tool and to monitor recovery in clinical trials, which will allow for more rapid development of better and cheaper treatments.","['medicine', 'worlds', 'develop', 'simple', 'million', 'treatment', 'diagnostic', 'better', 'active', 'patients', 'blood', 'diagnosis', 'scientists', 'test', 'tb', 'researchers', 'improve']"
foxnews,2016-02-17 00:00:00,The heat goes on: Earth sets 9th straight monthly record,[],"WASHINGTON  The January figures are in, and Earth's string of hottest-months-on-record has now reached nine in a row. But NASA said January stood out: The temperature was above normal by the highest margin of any month on record.

And January set another record: Arctic sea ice reached its lowest point for that ice-building winter month.

NASA said January 2016 was 2.03 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates temperatures differently, said last month was 1.87 degrees, which is the second biggest margin in history. NOAA said the greatest was this past December.

January's average global temperature was a record 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit, easily beating the old January record set in 2007, according to NOAA Records go back to 1880.

There were colder-than-normal patches in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in January, but they were overwhelmed by incredible ""off our chart"" warming in the Arctic region, according to NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. Siberia, northwest Canada, and a lot of Alaska were at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, she said.

That heat was why there was record low sea ice in the Arctic for this time of year, when sea ice grows, Blunden said.

January Arctic sea ice averaged only 5.2 million square miles in January, which is 90,000 square miles below the previous record set in 2011, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's also 402,000 square miles  about the size of Texas and New Mexico, combined  less than the 30-year normal.

The string of nine consecutive record hot months matches June 1997 to February 1998, which was the last time Earth had a large El Nino. It is still behind the 10 straight months of record heat in 1944, Blunden said. It's likely we'll tie that record in February, she said.

The current El Nino  an occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather around the world and spikes global temperatures  is tied with 1997-1998 for the strongest on record, according to NOAA. And while it has been predicted to ease soon, it has not lessened yet, said NOAA Climate Prediction Center deputy director Mike Halpert.

NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt blamed the record heat mostly on man-made climate change, with an assist from El Nino.","['climate', 'square', 'goes', 'monthly', 'straight', 'according', 'ice', 'noaa', 'record', 'heat', 'set', 'degrees', '9th', 'sets', 'earth', 'arctic', 'sea']"
foxnews,2016-02-16 00:00:00,Cougars are increasingly making meals of our pets,[],"Wildlife officials in California have a disturbing revelation for pet owners: Most mountain lions in the region seem to have acquired a taste for dogs and cats.

As the San Francisco Chronicle reports, that insight comes from an analysis of the stomach contents of mountain lions legally killed last year. Of the 83 cougars analyzed, 52% had recently dined on a dog, a cat, or another domestic animal.

The true percentage is likely higher, however, because the contents of 18% of the stomachs were too digested to make a determination. As for deer, considered a menu staple, a measly 5% of the mountain lions had eaten one.

One resident of Vista can attest, blaming a mountain lion for killing his Lab mix one morning earlier this month. My neighbor found him, basically mortally wounded,"" he tells Fox 5 San Diego, adding that ""multiple sightings"" of mountain lions have been reported locally. As if that's not enough cause for worry, an official with the Department of Fish and Wildlife says the new figures don't take into account coyotes. ""Many coyote attacks on animals and people happen when the coyote sneaks up from behind,"" he says. And yard attacks also are common.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,Scalia and the Supreme Court: What the Justice would want now,['Roger Pilon'],"After the tragic and untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the nation has before it the question of whether to fill his seat now or only after the people have spoken in November. On that question, those of us who knew him and knew his deep respect for the place of politics in our constitutional order know that he would have been the first to remind us that the president may nominate his replacement, but the Senates power to consent, or not, is equally important and equally to be respected.

Far more important than that immediate question, however, is whether Justice Scalias legacy of respect for the written Constitution and the limited government it authorizes will continue to animate the nations highest court, or whether instead the Court will join the political branches as handmaiden and move us ever closer to the vision President Obama and his party have been pushing now for nearly eight decades.

We need only look to those of Mr. Obamas persuasion who would succeed him for the particulars of that vision. Driven by identity politics and class warfare, and informed by a medieval understanding of economics, they would make America look like the rest of the worlda world from which so many of us have fled. They rail against our present economic straits, especially for the young, yet would only double down on the very policies that have brought us here and so endanger our future. Answering always the same, their solution for government created problems is more government programs.

Justice Scalia had little patience for that vision, but he was a study in judicial evolution. He arrived at the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982 a staunch friend of the free market but also a strict disciple of judicial restraint, the view then animating conservatives that judges should defer to the political branches in all but the clearest cases of constitutional abuse. Thus, in a famous debate two years later with his former University of Chicago colleague, Richard Epstein, over whether judges should better protect economic liberty than they had done in recent decades, Scalia argued that that should happen only if facilitated by the creation of a constitutional ethos of economic liberty, which he did not see. Rising to the occasion, Epstein pressed Scalia to pursue, energetically, the tasks that our Constitution assigns to him.

And so the issues were joined in a struggle that had begun a decade earlier at Chicago and would continue to the presentbetween conservatives urging judicial restraint, against the excesses of the Warren and Burger Courts, and libertarians urging judges to engage more fully in enforcing the Madisonian vision of constitutionally limited government. As that debate evolved increasingly in the direction of greater engagement, so too did many of the judges Presidents Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43 appointed, including Justice Scalia.

In 1993, for example, Scalia joined us at Cato for an informal luncheon discussion where I asked him if the Court was ever going to revive the doctrine of enumerated powers as wed been urgingthe bedrock principle that Congress has only limited, enumerated powers, the rest belonging to the states or the people, as the Tenth Amendment says. Oh we lost that battle a long time ago, he responded. Yet two years later the Court held, for the first time in 58 years, that Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate commerce when it enacted the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1990and Scalia was on the right side of that 5-4 decision. And two years after that he would write the 5-4 opinion holding that Congress had no power to dragoon state officials into carrying out federal functions.

Justice Scalias federalism was not entirely consistent. Nor did he ever wholly embrace the vision of constitutional liberty that many of us have urged. He is famous, however, for holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. That again was a 5-4 decision, as often were his property rights rulings. Thus, he held that South Carolina could not provide its citizens with various goods by prohibiting a man from building on his property, the result of which was to wipe out the million dollars hed paid for it. Shockingly, four justices would have allowed thatthe same four, ideologically speaking, who would have allowed government restrictions on religious liberty, school choice, campaign finance, and so much more.

Today, the complaint about an activist Court more often comes from progressives who see that branch as impeding their plans for ever more government. Mr. Obama should know: more than any other administration, his has lost before the Court more than half the time, many of the most important cases by a single vote. Is it any wonder that he wants to fill Justice Scalias seat as quickly as possible, or that he is already trying to shame Senate Republicans against a filibuster, the very tactic he himself employed against then-Judge Samuel Alito? And that was not a lame-duck year.

Given the profound implications for the nations future of this presidents filling this seat, it is imperative, especially after the people spoke so clearly in 2014, that they be allowed to speak once more about our future before this seat is filled.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

foxnews,2016-02-05 00:00:00,"The Moon or Mars? NASA must pick 1 goal for astronauts, experts tell Congress",[],"NASA can't afford to put humans on Mars while also pursuing missions to put astronauts back on the moon, according to a panel of experts who testified to the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Space Wednesday.

""Today the future of NASA's human spaceflight program is far from clear,"" said Tom Young, former director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""There has been continual debate about should we go to the moon or Mars or both ... It is clear, again, that we cannot do both. And there is a need to focus our attention, capability and resources on one option.""

NASA has been advertising its ""Journey to Mars"" campaign, with NASA Administrator Charles Bolden saying that humans could go to the Red Planet as early as the 2030s. But in addition to the technological and fiscal hurdles, the three panelists agreed that without a solid plan in place, none of the proposed human-spaceflight goals would come to fruition. [5 Ideas for Manned Missions to Mars]

Target: Mars

""In the current fiscal environment, there are no good pathways to Mars,"" said John Sommerer, retired director of the Space Department at Johns Hopkins University.

Sommerer contributed to a report that Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to assemble, which looked at the feasibility of human spaceflight endeavors. The results of its investigation were released in a report called ""Pathways to Exploration,"" in 2014.

The report concluded that ""the first crewed Mars landing might be possible 20 to 40 years from now, after a cumulative expenditure on the order of half a trillion dollars,"" Sommerer said.

If the current budget of $9 billion spent on human spaceflight ""remains constant, with the addition of inflation,"" Young said, then approximately $180 billion ""with today's spending power"" will be spent on human spaceflight over the next two decades.

""Just as it is not feasible to take a cross-country trip on a child's allowance ... we may well never be able to get to Mars at current expenditure levels,"" Sommerer said. ""It might be better to stop talking about Mars if there is no appetite in Congress and the administration for higher human spaceflight budgets, and no willingness to cut programs that do not contribute to progress.""

Subcommittee member Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., spoke enthusiastically to the panel about the possibility of a human mission to Mars, and pointed out some of the young people in the room who might be the ones to go to Mars. He showed the panel a bumper sticker that read ""Mars 2033: We Can Do This."" He pressed Sommerer to confirm that, if given a sufficient budget, NASA could put humans on Mars in only 17 years.

""If you give [NASA] the date, and the money, and help with the discipline, the answer is yes,"" Sommerer said. ""If any of those three things is missing, the answer is almost certainly no.""

Mo Brooks, R-Ala., noted that the United States is currently facing serious budget concerns. He mentioned the Constellation program  which aimed to put humans back on the moon by 2020, but which was defunded in 2010  and asked the panelists to talk about how to avoid putting money into missions that would ultimately not come to fruition, and what lessons could be learned.

Young spoke about the desire to have fewer ""tombstones"" for cancelled projects and more ""memorials"" to successful ones. He reiterated the thesis of his opening remarks, that what NASA needs more than anything is a concrete plan for how it should proceed.

""I am personally passionate about humans going to Mars, but I'm equally passionate about a good, disciplined plan that is not frivolous,"" he said. ""A plan that does what is required, but also ... doesn't just do what's possible.""

In a response to Brook, Sommerer brought up the possibility of defunding human spaceflight and relying entirely on robotic missions, which are ""much more cost effective.""

""That's a choice that, in really grim financial straits, the country might be forced to make,"" Sommerer said. ""But it doesn't seem to be something people want to stand up and proudly say, 'Let's end the human space endeavor and rely on only robots.'""

He added, ""Although the robot stuff is pretty cool.""

To the moon

The third member of the witness panel was Paul Spudis, a senior scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute at the Universities Space Research Association. Spudis' research is focused on the geology of the moon. In his opening remarks, Spudis laid out reasons why NASA and humanity should not only return humans to the surface of the moon, but also develop an entire infrastructure in cislunar space (the space between Earth and the moon) that would include ""transport vehicles, staging nodes, deep-space habitats, power stations and fuel depots.""

In the journey to send humans to other planets, a pit stop at the moon might to be the right way to go, Spudis argued. A moon base might help humans develop technologies and know-how to survive on Mars. Humans could potentially harvest resources from the moon, like water, which can be used to keep humans alive  as well as broken up into oxygen and hydrogen to fuel spacecraft. Having access to those resources could make a trip to Mars more feasible, he said. (This is a discussion going on in congress for some time).

""America's space program is in disarray,"" Spudis said. ""What we need is a logically arranged set of short-term, realizable space goals that are not only interesting in and of themselves, but whose attainment will build capability in the long term.""

Spudis also spoke about the need to have crewed spacecraft that can be used to visit satellites that humans are relying on more and more for communications and other daily services, such as GPS.

""Many of these satellites are national security assets. Satellites upon which we are critically dependent,"" Spudis said. Currently, when those satellites break, often the only option is to let them die and replace them, Spudis said.

""If we could move people and machines throughout various locales in cislunar space, we would be able to replace, construct, upgrade and maintain satellites,"" he said.

Spudis also said that China is developing the ability to ""travel throughout and loiter within cislunar space,"" which might enable the country to disable satellites belonging to other countries. Such a move would put the United States at a disadvantage if it didn't have the same capabilities, he said.

A cislunar program would also offer NASA a set of goals that could be obtained on much shorter timelines than a human mission to Mars. The appeal of financing a set of shorter-term goals, rather than a single, long-term goal, was echoed by subcommittee member Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who expressed concern at the prospect of investing in a human Mars mission, only to have it set aside if a more pressing priority arose.

Moving forward

It is highly unlikely that the United States would be able to afford to simultaneously pursue a human mission to Mars while also deploying human missions to the moon or cislunar space, said Young during his testimony.

If congress decided to push for NASA to pursue a human mission to Mars, Young said, the agency would need to develop a specific plan in the near future ""that takes us from today to humans on Mars."" He listed a dozen things that such a plan would need to address, including defining intermediate missions that would be needed to prepare for a Mars trip, assessing risk, getting an idea of the resources that would need to be allocated and applying those resources ""in the most effective manner.""

""An argument against a plan at the current time is that we are not ready to finalize the necessary elements of the plan,"" Young said. ""I believe a strength of NASA program management is to establish a plan relatively early, with the recognition that as new information becomes available, the plan can be changed.""

""We have our work cut out to us,"" subcommittee chair Brian Babin, (R-Texas, 36th District) said in his closing comments. ""I agree that whatever NASA puts their mind to we can do. But we do have the parameters of an almost 20 trill dollar national debt that we have at this time. ... I think we have our marching orders. We just have to get organized on this.""","['goal', 'congress', 'space', 'sommerer', 'pick', 'humans', 'young', 'astronauts', 'moon', 'nasa', 'experts', 'plan', 'human', 'mars', 'spudis', 'tell']"

In his victory speech in South Carolina, Donald Trump vowed to sweep the twelve primaries held on Super Tuesday, March 1, and implied the race would then be over: Lets put this thing away!

TUNE IN TO 'HANNITY' AT 10 PM ET WHEN DONALD TRUMP JOINS SEAN AND A STUDIO AUDIENCE FOR THE ENTIRE HOUR! DON'T MISS IT!

He also belittled rivals who claimed that as the field shrinks, they will be able to close on Trump and deny him the nomination. Theyre geniuses! he mocked. They dont understand that as people drop out, Im going to get a lot of those votes also.

Not so fast, Donald. We have had three contests so far, and the field has narrowed from twelve candidates before Iowa to five now. But Trumps numbers have bounced around from 24 percent in Iowa to 35 percent in New Hampshire to 32 percent in South Carolina. His average is a tad under 31 percent.

Trump is the front-runner, but he has to find a way to win a majority of the delegates, and the kind of campaign hes running is making it harder for him to crack a ceiling of about a third of the vote.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The Most Common Questions Asked by Home Sellers -- Answered!,[],"Selling a home you've lived in and loved over the years isn't exactly like unloading your collection of old Slayer LPs on Craigslist (or is it...?). It's hard. It's emotional. And above all else, it's complicated. A slew of questions will likely pop into your head throughout the process -- and possibly keep you up at night.

Last week, we revealed the most common questions asked by home buyers. Since people on the other end of this deal have a lot on their minds, too, today we'll tackle the most common questions that real estate agents hear from sellers -- along with some answers, of course.

Q: How much needs to be done to my house before putting it on the market?

""Many sellers have extreme anxiety over the thought of having to clear out and fix up their home, so much so that it can prevent them from putting the place on the market in the first place,"" says Alyssa Blevins with Pierce Murdock Group. But in most cases, there's no need to panic here -- or to overshoot your goals. ""Very often, there's far less to do than homeowners think."" So before spending months and millions (figuratively) upgrading your place -- or just throwing up your hands and giving up before you begin -- show your home to a Realtor. You might be pleasantly surprised by your current sales prospects.

Q: How much is my house worth?

While the median house price in 2016 is $228,000, the exact price of your own home will depend on its size, neighborhood, and lots of other factors. Further complicating matters is your own skewed perspective: We tend to mentally inflate our home's positives and airbrush out the flaws that are all too apparent to the cold, calculating eyes of buyers. ""People always seem to compare their house to the most expensive sale in the neighborhood,"" says Mary Ann Grabel, an agent at Douglas Elliman in Greenwich, CT. Instead, look at the prices of similarly sized homes that have recently sold in your area -- data that agents call comparative market analysis, or ""comps."" Then, price your place strategically. ""If you price too high, the home is likely to linger on the market,"" says Grabel. Meanwhile, pricing low can have major upsides, resulting in multiple bids that could ultimately jack up your price. So, do your homework. Then, discuss a number with your Realtor that feels right -- and is realistic.

Q: How long will it take to sell my home?

Right now, nationally, houses spend around 100 days on the market before they sell, although the time varies wildly based on area and price. So, price competitively and make sure that you and your Realtor are getting the place in front of as many eyeballs as possible. ""The higher the exposure, the faster the offers,"" says Felise Eber, a real estate associate affiliated with Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate and part of the Miami Beach luxury real estate sales team The Jills. Spread the word through your own social networks -- -- real ones and virtual ones. You never know whose passing it along to that special someone will lead to a sale.

Q: Is staging really important?

On average, a staged home sells 88% faster -- and for 20% more money -- than a home that's left as is. The reason it works, of course, is it gives buyers a ""stage"" onto which they can play out their home-owning fantasies and envision themselves living in your home. ""Choose neutral paint colors and remove any family photos,"" says Johnson. Give would-be homeowners a blank canvass that they can mentally fill with their loved ones and themselves.

Q: Should I be present when buyers view my house?

""NO!"" says Johnson. (Hey, no need to shout. We're right here!) ""There is not any situation in which this is appropriate. Having the owner in the house makes the buyers uncomfortable. They feel as though they can't make comments or ask questions that could be offensive. The owner -- who has a history and attachment to the house -- has the tendency to argue if a potential buyer makes a comment that could be a little negative. This can turn off buyers and lose you offers."" Got it.

Q: What is the agent's commission?

While the commission can vary, it is typically 6% of a home's sale price -- and that's usually shared with the buyer's agent. But what's implied by this question is "" What are Realtors doing to earn that fat check?"" Here are some facts to keep in mind: Unlike lawyers who get paid by the hour, or doctors who are paid by the appointment, listing agents don't get paid unless they make a sale. For every hour an agent spends with a client, he or she will typically spend nine hours on average working on that client's behalf doing everything from networking to finding potential buyers to filling out paperwork. And no, not all agents are created equal. Since most contracts last for a year, Realtor Susan Ratliff recommends that sellers ""interview three agents prior to selecting one to represent them. It's no different from choosing an attorney, accountant, or the doctor who will deliver your baby. You want to be sure that you trust that person and are comfortable with them.""

foxnews,2016-02-12 00:00:00,What's with the long face? Horses know when you're in a bad mood,['Michael Casey'],"Anyone who spends time around horses knows they are incredible sensitive and affectionate. But can they tell when you have had a bad day?

A new study says horses can, offering evidence for the first time that they can recognize when someone is happy or angry from looking at our faces. The findings suggests there is plenty more to learn about emotional expression across species.

In their Biology Letters study, researchers from the University of Sussex showed a group of 28 horses photographs of positive and negative human expressions  mostly of faces that looked really happy or very angry. The horses appeared to respond most to the angry faces, giving a sideways glance with the left eye to the photo  considered important because negative events are processed in the right hemisphere of the brain. Their heart rate also increased more quickly and they showed more stress-related behaviors.

What's really interesting about this research is that it shows that horses have the ability to read emotions across the species barrier, Amy Smith, a doctoral student at the University of Sussex who co-led the research, said in a statement.

Related: Dogs can detect emotion in human voices, study shows

We have known for a long time that horses are a socially sophisticated species but this is the first time we have seen that they can distinguish between positive and negative human facial expressions,"" she said. ""The reaction to the angry facial expressions was particularly clear - there was a quicker increase in their heart rate, and the horses moved their heads to look at the angry faces with their left eye.""

Karen McComb, who also was a co-lead author of the research, said the findings illustrate that horses may have developed this ability to read emotions over time.

Horses may have adapted an ancestral ability for reading emotional cues in other horses to respond appropriately to human facial expressions during their co-evolution, she said. Alternatively, individual horses may have learned to interpret human expressions during their own lifetime. What's interesting is that accurate assessment of a negative emotion is possible across the species barrier despite the dramatic difference in facial morphology between horses and humans.""

Smith and her colleagues said it was interesting that the horses had such a strong reaction to the negative expressions, and little to no response to the positive. They acknowledged that it could be influenced by the fact these were faces the horses had not seen before and that more work was needed to understand the response by age, gender and other indicators.

""This may be because it is particularly important for animals to recognize threats in their environment, Smith said. In this context, recognizing angry faces may act as a warning system, allowing horses to anticipate negative human behavior such as rough handling.""

Robin Foster, a horse behavior expert at the University of Puget Sound who was not part of the research, said the study was solid and the methods were simple and elegantreminiscent of the early studies of the expression and recognition of emotions in human psychology.

Horses are socially intelligent animals, but the simplest explanation or why horses in this study reacted to angry human faces (but not happy ones) is associative learningangry faces are linked to unpleasant or painful experiences, Foster told FoxNews.com in an email interview, though she acknowledged the study left room for alternative explanations.

""Alternatively the horse may have simply been checking in with the handler, who always stood on the horse's left side - which would also explain why the horse looked to the left more when happy face was presented,"" she said. ""There is good evidence that horses seek out the proximity of familiar people to cope with stress.""

The finding is the latest to demonstrate the connections between humans and animals. Dogs, for example, were shown this year to be able to recognize positive and negative emotional states in human. And last year, a study in Science found that the connections between humans and their dogs have the same biochemical basis as the mother-child bond, and it's strengthened by a loving gaze.

Horses, though, like dogs, have been domesticated for use with people, which means generation after generation of intentional selection means that animals with the most favorable human interactions have been retained and perpetuated through breeding, training, and use, Miami Universitys Allen R. McConnell, the president elect of the Midwestern Psychological Association, told FoxNews.com in an email interview.

Dogs, for example, are adept at reading their owners because of such self-perpetuating processes in self-selection, he said. Many dogs can read faces, detect stress through smelling cortisol, etc. The study looks reasonable (e.g., blind video coding, inferential statistics used), so it seems like its conclusions are sensible.","['horses', 'dogs', 'whats', 'mood', 'study', 'youre', 'negative', 'long', 'face', 'bad', 'know', 'human', 'faces', 'expressions', 'research', 'angry', 'left']"

Erica Rosello, 32, was charged with child neglect with great bodily harm stemming from the Thursday blaze, The Miami Herald reported.

The girl was taken to a hospital, treated for smoke inhalation and is currently in the care of her grandmother. A judge has barred Rosello from seeing her daughter and placed Rosello under house arrest, according to CBS Miami.

Rosello was allegedly in the hallway of her apartment complex when a witness saw smoke coming from Rosellos apartment. The witness said Rosello denied there was a fire but acknowledged her daughter was inside, according to a police report obtained by The Herald. The witness tried rescuing the girl, but couldnt get inside the apartment.

Miami-Dade firefighter David Arencibia told WSVN that the girl would have died if she remained in the apartment for another 3 minutes.

I just told my partner to get on one knee, used him as a prop, he helped me up and I climbed in through the window, Arencibia said.

He added: When I picked her up, she started moaning, which was a good thing.

After firefighters saved the girl, Rosello fled. She later called her mom to check on the young girl and Rosellos mom convinced her to come to the hospital.

Its unclear what caused the fire, but authorities are investigating.

The firefighter basically entered a smoke-filled room and found the little girl lying on the bed, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokeswoman Erika Benitez told The Herald. This is the type of rescue that every firefighter hopes for, in the sense that it had the best possible outcome. She was brought out to safety and the fire was contained.","['apartment', 'daughter', 'burning', 'inside', 'firefighter', 'told', 'leaving', 'herald', 'mom', 'girl', 'rosello', 'witness', 'charged']"
foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,"FBI owes it to victims to access San Bernardino killer's phone, director says",[],"FBI Director James Comey said late Sunday that the agency owed the victims of last December's San Bernardino terror attack a ""thorough and professional investigation"" in an effort to explain why law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help them gain access to a cellphone owned by one of the gunmen.

In a post on the Lawfare blog, Comey wrote that the FBI ""can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.""

The post was Comey's first public statement since Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into Syed Farook's work-issued iPhone. Farook, along with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in the Dec. 2 attacks.

On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with the court order. Early Monday, Cook sent an email to Apple employees saying that the FBI should withdraw its demand.

In the message, subject-lined ""Thank you for your support,"" Cook states that the company has ""no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists"" and believes abiding by the judge's order would be unlawful, an expansion of government powers, and would set a dangerous precedent that would essentially create a backdoor to the encrypted iPhone.



""This case is about much more than a single phone or a single investigation,"" Cook wrote, ""so when we received the government's order we knew we had to speak out.""



""At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone's civil liberties.""

Apple also points to the difficulty of keeping such a ""master key"" safe once it has been created. The government has said that Apple could keep the specialized technology it would create to help officials hack the phone -- bypassing a security time delay and feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack.

If the company's engineers were to do as ordered, Apple would do its best to protect the technology, but Cook said the company ""would be relentlessly attacked by hackers and cybercriminals.""



In his blog post, Comey had written, ""The San Bernardino litigation isn't about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.

""The relief we seek is limited and its value increasingly obsolete because the technology continues to evolve,"" Comey continued. ""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That's it.""

Comey did acknowledge in his statement that the clash has laid bare a tension between privacy and security. But he said that divide should not be resolved by the FBI nor ""corporations that sell stuff for a living.""

""It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before,"" he said.

Cook's question-and-answer posting acknowledged that it is technically possible for Apple to do what the judge ordered, but that it's ""something we believe is too dangerous to do."" U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers said Friday that Apple has followed court orders to unlock phones at least 70 times in various cases.

Apple has until Feb. 26 to file its opposition to the initial order.

Kizza Besigye was arrested as he tried to leave his home where he had been confined under house arrest. Associated Press journalists saw police manhandle him into the back of a blacked-out van and taken away to an undisclosed location.

Besigye had been going to the election commission to get detailed copies of results from presidential election. He has called for an independent audit that includes the international community.

Polly Namaye, a police spokeswoman, said officers arrested Besigye to keep him from ""storming the electoral commission with his supporters.""

Neutral observers had criticized the government for using security forces against opposition candidates and supporters.

The commission announced Saturday that Museveni won the vote with more than 60 percent of counted ballots, while Besigye got 35 percent.

Those results did not include tallies from at least 1,242 polling stations, election commission spokesman Jotham Taremwa told AP on Monday. That's about 4 percent of all polling stations.

Taremwa said the missing results cannot change the outcome, but Besigye's supporters note they could bring down Museveni's margin of victory. Museveni needed 50 percent plus one vote to avoid a runoff election.

The election commission lacks independence and transparency, the European Union observer mission said.

The 71-year-old Museveni seized power in 1986. He is a key U.S. ally on security matters, especially in Somalia.

Besigye was Museveni personal physician during the 1981 to 1986 bush war between Museveni's rebels and forces loyal to former President Milton Obote. He also served as deputy interior minister in his first Cabinet, and broke with the president in 1999, saying he was no longer a democrat.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Donald Trump muses about Marco Rubio's eligibility to run for president,[],"Marco Rubio has joined Ted Cruz in Donald Trumps crosshairs.

Fresh off his Saturday win in the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said Sunday he didnt know whether Rubio, a Florida senator who finished second, was eligible to run for president and that the lawyers have to determine that.

I dont know, Trump told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week. I really  Ive never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it. As somebody said, hes not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things, and we start dialogue and its very interesting.

Rubio brushed aside Trumps assertions later on This Week.

""@ResisTyr: Mr.Trump...BOTH Cruz AND Rubio are ineligible to be POTUS! It's a SLAM DUNK CASE!! Check it! https://t.co/NjqWP0pP6X""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2016

This is a pattern, Rubio said. This is a game he plays. He says something thats edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that. And then no one else can get any coverage on anything else.

And that worked where there were 15 people running for president. Its not going to work anymore. Im going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.

Trump was questioned on the issue after he retweeted a supporter Saturday who made the allegation and linked to a video from the Powdered Wig Society, a conservative news and commentary website. That video features an unidentified woman claiming someone can only be a natural-born citizen if the persons father was a U.S. citizen.

The Constitution states only a natural-born citizen can be president, though it does not explicitly define that phrase.

Rubio, whose parents came to the U.S. from Cuba in the 1950s, was born in Florida in 1971. His parents were not U.S. citizens at the time.

Trumps musings about Rubios eligibility is comparable to how his similar feud began with Cruz, a Texas senator, though that argument has since intensified.

Trump has argued that Cruz, who finished third in South Carolina, may not be a natural-born citizen because he was born in Canada, even though his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of Cruzs birth.

Numerous legal scholars have said both Cruz and Rubio are considered natural-born citizens, though Trump has said other experts disagree.

I mean, let people make their own determination, Trump said Sunday.

Similar questions of eligibility dogged previous Republican contenders such as John McCain in 2008, George Romney in 1968 and Barry Goldwater in 1964. McCain was born in Panama, Romney was born in Mexico and Goldwater was born in Arizona before it became an official U.S. state.","['video', 'marco', 'run', 'trump', 'born', 'muses', 'naturalborn', 'rubio', 'rubios', 'eligibility', 'donald', 'cruz', 'trumps', 'citizen', 'president', 'george']"

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"After South Carolina, can anybody take on Trump?",[],"Donald Trump on Sunday expressed measured optimism about winning the nomination, compared to his bravado after his overnight South Carolina victory, saying he could always be stopped.

The front-running Trump won 33 percent of the vote in the Republican South Carolina primary, roughly 11 percent ahead of challengers Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Ted Cruz, of Texas.

The win is Trumps second in the first three, early-state contests and now focuses the debate on whether any the four other remaining candidates can stop him, in part by taking the support for Jeb Bush, who suspended his campaign after a disappointing fourth-place finish on Saturday in South Carolina.

I guess you can always be stopped, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I have very good competition. ... They are very talented people.

In his South Carolina victory speech, Trump said, Lets put this thing away.

To be sure, Trump appears to be in a good position. Every Republican presidential candidate who has won New Hampshire and South Carolina has taken the party nomination. And he appears to have strong support in the Deep South as the primary season swings into the region next month.

Trump notably held a rally this summer in Mobile, Ala. that attracted an estimated 30,000 people.

Rubio and Cruz remain confident they can eventually get more votes as the GOP field continues to narrow, then overtake Trump.

The eventual winner will face either Democrat Bernie Sanders or front-runner Hillary Clinton, who on Saturday night won her partys Nevada caucus over Sanders 53-to-47 percent.

She defeated Sanders in Iowa, but lost to him in New Hampshire.

Rubio told Fox News Sunday that he has a real sense of optimism after South Carolina. However, Rubio said he is not trying to get other candidates, specifically Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished fifth in South Carolina, to drop out, which could give Rubio even more of the so-called establishment vote now that Bush is out.

The sooner we coalesce, the better we can do as a party, he said. Its going to happen one way or another.

Cruz told ABCs This Week that Trump is a formidable candidate but polls show a majority of voters dont think he can beat Clinton.

You cannot come from him at the left, Cruz said of his primary strategy. You have to have a true conservative to win.

Clintons Nevada win came just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire.

""To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,"" Clinton tweeted after the race was called.","['sanders', 'trump', 'win', 'told', 'anybody', 'primary', 'rubio', 'won', 'nevada', 'south', 'carolina']"
foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,"Southbound, Clinton aims to build delegate edge over Sanders",[],"The election calendar may have Democrats voting next in South Carolina, but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are eyeing bigger prizes in March, a month that will determine whether the Vermont senator can keep pace in the White House race.

Clinton shook off some of the anxieties shadowing her campaign with a solid victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses.

The results offered a glimpse of her strength with black voters. They are a crucial group in South Carolina, which holds its primary this coming Saturday, and in other Southern states with contests on March 1, Super Tuesday.

Sanders has yet to prove he can consistently expand his base of support beyond white liberals and young voters. His campaign cited progress with Latinos in Nevada, but his advisers are clear-eyed about the challenges on Super Tuesday.

They are mapping out plans to stay close to Clinton in the delegate count until the race turns to friendlier territory later in March.

""Because we can do the long game, once we get past March 1, the calendar changes dramatically,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. ""It's frontloaded for her, but we have the ability to stay in the long game.""

More than half the 2,383 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination will be determined in the 28 states that hold primaries and caucuses in March.

Clinton and Sanders should have enough money to stay in the race for weeks afterward, but the delegate tally at the end of the month could make the results inevitable.

For Sanders, strong showings in March are more important because of Clinton's lead with superdelegates -- the party leaders who can support any candidates regardless of how their states vote.

Clinton has captured the support of 451 superdelegates compared with Sanders' 19.

Underpinning Clinton's strategy are the painful lessons of her 2008 primary loss to Barack Obama.

Clinton's campaign failed to account for the Democratic Party's system of allocating delegates proportionally in voting contests, then watched superdelegates, who can shift their allegiances, move toward Obama as the campaign stretched late into the spring.

Under the proportional system, avoiding overwhelming losses that can dramatically shift the delegate totals is almost as important as outright victories.

""Other than Vermont, I don't see a single state where Hillary Clinton is going to lose in a blowout. I see a lot of states where Hillary Clinton will probably win by a lot and that equals real delegate yield,"" said David Plouffe, the architect of Obama's 2008 campaign and a Clinton supporter.

""I know that's not sexy, but I think that's how the Clinton campaign has structured their campaign this time after some of the lessons from eight years ago.""

Few observers had foreseen Sanders as a serious threat to Clinton. But he has energized young people, working-class voters and liberals with his impassioned calls for breaking up big Wall Street banks and making tuition at public colleges and universities free.

""I think the more people know our record, the better we do,"" Sanders said Sunday on CBS' ""Face The Nation.""

Sanders' prolific online fundraising has given him staying power and he has pledged to take his campaign into the Democratic convention in July.

While Sanders outraised Clinton in January, a new fundraising report showed he went on a spending spree at the start of the year and ended last month with about $15 million in available cash -- less than half of Clinton's cash on hand.

That's enough to stay competitive and Sanders' team is eying delegates in March 1 states such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state.

He also hopes to flex his muscles in two other states with contests that day, Colorado and Virginia, and help him make the case that he is more electable than Clinton.

Sanders' campaign has cited entrance polls of Nevada caucus-goers showing him doing better than Clinton among Latino voters.

But the high margin of error in the polls makes it impossible to say with confidence whether either candidate held a lead among the group.

While Sanders was campaigning in South Carolina on Sunday, he planned to be in Massachusetts for a college rally and campaign in Norfolk, Virginia, on Tuesday.

Clinton also was spending time in Super Tuesday states. She flew from Nevada on Saturday to Texas, a huge delegate prize, for a late-night rally in Houston. She planned to raise money in California on the week and then campaign in South Carolina.

Beyond Super Tuesday, Clinton and Sanders are looking ahead to the March 15 contests in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. Big wins in those states for either candidate would put the nomination within sight.

Clinton's support among black voters could pay dividends because of the way Democrats award high-performing congressional districts with a greater share of delegates.

Many of the most delegate-rich states have large minority populations, including Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Illinois and Florida, giving Clinton an inside track to accumulate delegates in March.

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,The surprising new reason why eating fried foods may be good for you,[],"Attention, French fry addicts: Your favorite food may not be so terrible for you after all.

At least, that's the conclusion made by a recent study published in Food Chemistry that found that the antioxidant content of deep-fried potatoes, pumpkin, tomatoes, and eggplant was significantly higher than sauteed or boiled veggies.

It's no secret among nutritionists that adding a fat source to vegetablese.g., roasting them with olive oil or using full-fat salad dressing over the fat-free stuffboosts absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. So it's not totally illogical that deep-frying could take things a step further: When vegetables are fried in a healthy oil (think extra virgin olive oil), antioxidant compounds called phenols in the oil are transferred to veggies, said Frances Largeman-Roth, RD, author of Eating in Color, who was not involved in the study. In other words, a hot oil bath doesn't just unlock nutrients already inside vegetablesit actually helps infuse them with more nutrients than they started with.

MORE: The Super Common Oil That Science Now Shows Is Worse Than Sugar

As for other greasy goodies like fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, and cheese curds, researchers don't know whether these foods soak up any phenols at all when fried. Largeman-Roth speculates that these foods have lower water content than vegetables, which doesn't allow them to soak up as much oil (and, consequently, phenols), if any at all.

These findings, while exciting, don't give you a carte blanche to go crazy on those fried zucchini chips whenever you feel like it, though. All that oiland batter if veggies are coated before fried, which most aremeans major calories, which could spell a fast-track to weight gain, overconsumption, and other health problems.

Also, researchers fried veggies in extra virgin olive oil, which is known for its sky-high levels of phenols. Frying in regular olive oil or refined vegetable oils prolific used by most restaurants might not have had the same effect, Largeman-Roth said. Even worse, some restaurant frying oils contain trans fat. (Here are 14 cooking oils and which is the healthiest for you.)

Oil temperature is also an issue. While frying in EVOO can imbue your veggies with more antioxidants, those benefits backfire if the oil gets too hot.

""If you heat any oil past its smoke point, it starts to break down and release free radicals,"" Largman-Roth said.

The study used a fry temperature of around 350 degrees, which is safely below extra virgin olive oil's 400 degree smoke point. (Try this healthy gluten-free 'fried' chicken.)

Of course, you can't control the type of oil or temperature used in a restaurant fryer, but you can at home. What to do? If you want to eat fried food as an occasional indulgence, stick to vegetables that you fry at home in high-quality oil, using a fry thermometer to make sure the oil doesn't go above its smoke point.

foxnews,2016-02-19 00:00:00,14 Republican Governors: Why Jeb Bush has the executive experience to be president,['Tom Ridge'],"As the battle for the Republican nomination heats up, conservative voters need to think, first and foremost, about which conservative candidate can defeat Hillary Clinton and then have the leadership skills and experience to clean up the mess left behind by Barack Obamas two failed terms.

As former governors, we are endorsing Governor Jeb Bush because he stands head and shoulders above the rest of the field in terms of having a proven record of delivering conservative reforms that empowered people to improve their quality of life. In Florida, Jeb set the gold standard that many of us looked to when bringing about conservative change in our states. Conservative columnist, George Will, declared earlier this year that Jeb Bush was the most consequential big state governor since Ronald Reagan. Will is right.

During Jebs governorship, Florida earned a AAA bond rating upgrade, saving taxpayers significant money. He cut taxes by $19 billion, balanced eight budgets, shrank state government by 11 percent and accumulated nearly $10 billion of budget reserves, protecting Florida from rainy day situations.

Governor Bushs leadership on the economy was also stellar. During his administration, Florida became the national leader in job creation and small business creation as 1.3 million new jobs were created and middle class incomes rose by $1,300.

Jeb also made Florida the national model for conservative education reform. He beat the teachers union to enact three statewide voucher programs and to nearly triple the number of charter schools in the state. Jeb focused on high standards for student learning and held educators accountable, driving significant improvements in student achievement that are illustrated by the fact that the high school graduation rate in Florida has increased by nearly 50 percent since the Bush school reforms were enacted.

Now that Governor Bush is a candidate for president he is offering concrete policy solutions that are rooted in the conservative principles he fought and won on in Florida. Jeb has the best plans to grow our economy at full strength to help ensure that the middle class receives the first pay raise in 15 years. He has the boldest ideas to reform the spending culture in Washington, fix the impending crisis with entitlements and balance the budget to bring the spiraling national debt under control.

Most importantly, Jeb is a strong leader with a steady hand who is ready to be Commander-in-Chief and keep our homeland safe. Jeb has been endorsed by 12 Medal of Honor recipients and more than 40 retired admirals and generals because he is a crisis leader who has been tested time and again. From 2004-2005, Florida was hit by eight major hurricanes and four tropical storms. Governor Bush led an unprecedented response and recovery effort that brought his state together and contributed to him leaving office with a 67 percent job approval rating.

To respond to an increasingly dangerous world, Governor Bush has outlined a detailed strategy to rebuild our military, destroy ISIS and address the growing threats presented by Vladimir Putins aggression in Eastern Europe; Irans ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon and Chinas military buildup and desire to become a dominant force in the South China Sea. Jeb understands what it takes for America to project power abroad and he will be a leader who will restore the trust of our allies, while striking fear in the hearts of Americas enemies.

While there are some very talented politicians running for the Republican nomination who are gifted orators, no one running can match the decision making ability of Governor Bush. Governors are different than Senators in one key way. We are held accountable for delivering results and cannot get away with offering amendments, issuing press releases and declaring victory. Jeb Bush is stand up and take-charge type of leader who will fight to forge consensus and break the partisan gridlock in Washington. We are confident that he would be a transformational president of the United States, paving the way for middle class families to achieve earned success and restoring Americas standing in the international community.

foxnews,2015-02-09 00:00:00,ISIS and the war on terror: What should the US do next?,[],"This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" February 8, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. Allies united against ISIS. Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Jordan pounding ISIS targets this morning. The UAE back in the battle supplying more planes.

Now how should Americans add our own muscle to the fight against ISIS? We're covering this story throughout the program this morning with congressional and military guests.

The GOP presents its plan to erase ObamaCare.

Is it better? Is it likely to pass? We'll discuss the details of that and a lot more with Senator John Hoeven coming up.

And a full court press by the West to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict. How far did they get? We'll take a look and talk to a business man with an insider's view of just how corrupt post-Communist Russia really is. He barely escaped with his life. Others, not so lucky. He'll tell us his first-hand story as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(MUSIC PLAYING)

BARTIROMO: And Jordan continues to pound ISIS strongholds this morning, not believing the terror group's claim that a Jordanian airstrike has killed U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller.

Meanwhile the president plans to formally ask Congress to authorize the use of military force against ISIS in the coming days.

What should the U.S. response be now? Congressman Bob Goodlatte is with me, he's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and he joins us now.

Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.

REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Thank you, Maria.

BARTIROMO: So what should the U.S.' response look like, when we hear from the president to authorize the use of military forces, what do you think that force should look like?

GOODLATTE: I believe for a long time that the current authorization for use of military force in Iraq, now more than a dozen years old, is out of date, needs to be replaced. We should take a careful look at what the president presents to us, recognizing it's a good thing that Jordan and some of the Gulf states and others in the Middle East are recognizing they're on the front lines.

The threat is to them. And they should step up. We should support them and we should give the president appropriate authority to do that support.

Now one of the big questions, of course, will be what about boots on the ground?

Again, we've got to be careful not to tie the president's hands. But we do not want to have major U.S. military ground forces placed back in an area where we think others should be stepping up and taking the lead. But targeted strikes and rescue missions and a whole host of other activities, spotters on the ground and so on, we need to give the president some flexibility in this area. But we need to look carefully at an appropriate authorization of use of military force.

BARTIROMO: The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since August.

Has it worked?

GOODLATTE: I think it has definitely helped. There is no question that we've turned them back in a few places. We've seen some towns recovered by Kurdish forces and other forces in the area. But obviously more needs to be done.

I think that some of the terrorist acts that they have taken place, burning Jordanian air force officer in a cage, may be a reflection of their desperation more than it is simply their barbarity. But either way, I think this is a long-term battle against Islamic radical terrorists. And we need to make sure we're doing our part.

It's not just happening in the Middle East. FBI Director Comey said in Mississippi just a couple of days ago that they have active investigations of suspected ISIS collaborators in 49 states. So this is something we can't simply allow to say it's going to happen in someplace else and we don't need to be involved in it. We do need to be involved.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: Yes, Congressman. I wanted to hear more about that and I also want to ask you about the idea of cyber security and Internet terrorism. So stay with us, Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

First, let's dig deeper into the scope of Jordan's fight against ISIS. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins us now with that angle.

Good morning to you, Eric.

ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.

And good morning, everyone. It has a king who is also an attack helicopter pilot who did not hesitate to strike back. King Abdullah is leading not from behind, but from the front.

A monarch in a flight suit, a potent symbol of Jordan's defiance against ISIS, 53-year-old King Abdullah, who served in the Royal Jordanian Army and flew Cobra antitank helicopters in the air force, is now taking the fight directly against the ISIS killers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MOHAMMAD AL MOMANI, STATE MINISTER FOR MEDIA AFFAIRS, JORDAN: We will do whatever it takes in order to fight this organization and defeat this organization. We think this is the best of our country. Of course we strongly believe that other countries in the region as well as the international community must shoulder part of the responsibility.

SHAWN (voice-over): Jordan vows that a, quote, ""relentless war against ISIS"" and has carried out four days of continuing airstrikes in revenge for that barbaric burning to death of its pilot, despite being dwarfed by larger militaries. The country ranks number 67th, according to global firepower and military strength with a defense budget of $1.5 billion. It can field just over 110,000 active military personnel. The air force has 246 military aircraft, including 74 fighters or interceptors and 42 fixed-wing attack aircraft.

But like the U.S., Jordan continues to rule out sending so-called boots on the ground. Even though Iraq and Syria's Arab and Persian Gulf neighbors can potentially field armies of more than 1 million troops against the Islamic State. But for now have no plans to do that.

AL MOMANI: I think that nobody is talking about troops on the ground. The idea about boots on the ground is that we will help the Iraqi military.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SHAWN: But Jordan says since that unforgivable video was released, it has launched 56 strikes against ISIS and has so far flown 946 sorties out of a total of 5,500 coalition airstrikes or just under 20 percent. Scrawled on a Jordanian bomb that was hanging under a jet fighter just before a mission against ISIS was one simple message. It said, ""For you, the enemies of Islam."" -- Maria.

BARTIROMO: All right, Eric, thanks very much, Eric Shawn with the latest there.

More now with Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

And, Congressman, you have been a leader in terms of Internet and technology issues on your committee. Let me get your take on your expectations for cyber terrorism and whether or not this is an area that you think ISIS will next pursue.

GOODLATTE: Well, it is certainly something that various elements of terrorist organizations have pursued and the United States needs to step up its game. Greater cooperation between government agencies, greater cooperation between private companies and the government in making sure that cyber attacks of various kinds are repulsed. We need to make sure our intelligence organizations have the ability to gather the information they need but not at the expense of the civil liberties of law abiding American citizens.

We passed a good bill through Congress last year to take up again this year offered by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner that set, I think, the right guidelines, barred the government from collection of metadata but still gave them the opportunity to do what they need to do to gather the information to investigate terrorist plots that can take place in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, lay out the next two days for us when the president asks Congress for the authority for more military force.

How does this play out this upcoming week?

GOODLATTE: We should take that and look at it very carefully. I don't think we need to rush into giving a very quick response. Remember the president has had a mixed record here. He did not seek authorization for use of military force to go into Libya. Many complications have ensued from that.

He then sought the authorization to go into Syria against the current Syrian government. That got a very negative response from the Congress. I think there's more open-mindedness right now about finding the right balance here in terms of giving him the authority that he needs without us stepping out in front of these Middle Eastern nations like Jordan that need to take the lead in protecting their region and in fighting ISIS. But we should be strong supporters of what they're doing.

BARTIROMO: And Jordan is one of a handful of Middle Eastern countries that have joined the fight against ISIS.

Are you expecting that number to increase?

GOODLATTE: I certainly hope it will because they clearly are the ones who are on the front lines. This kind of radical terrorism is not what I think they want the world to see about the Middle East. There have been Muslim clerics around the world speaking out against the horrific acts taken by ISIS and we need to get their help in pushing back on this because this is a long-term problem with extremism trying to take hold, not just in the Middle East. We saw it in France just recently and we've seen it in the United States before and we'll see it again if we're not proactive in combating it.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for joining us today.

GOODLATTE: Thanks, Maria.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

Republicans unveil a Plan B meanwhile for ObamaCare.

What are the details?

How is their replacement different from the Affordable Care Act?

We'll talk with Senator John Hoeven about that next.

I hope you'll follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo is my handle, @SundayFutures is the program. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Senator Hoeven. Send me a tweet. Stay with us as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A group of congressional Republicans, Senators Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch and Congressman Upton have unveiled their place -- their plan to replace ObamaCare. It is similar to an outline proposed last year by Burr, Hatch and former Senator Tom Coburn.

It includes targeted tax credits for those living up to 300 percent above the poverty line, allowing insurance companies to sell plans across state lines, repealing the individual mandate. But, like ObamaCare, kids can stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 years old. And pre- existing conditions are covered, that is, unless you let your coverage lapse for a couple of months, under the GOP plan. Insurers could take that into account.

Senator John Hoeven is joining us. He is on the Appropriations Committee and the Energy Committee.

Senator, good to have you on the program.

SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, R-N.D.: Thanks, Maria. Good to be with you.

BARTIROMO: What is the viability of this new replacement to ObamaCare, do you think?

HOEVEN: I think it's a good plan. It's about empowering people rather than expanding government. And if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidy that states are getting under the federal exchange, we're going to have to have another plan. And I hope there's some support both in the Congress and on the part of the administration to go to this kind of approach.

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen so far from anticipation of ObamaCare or actual implementation of ObamaCare?

HOEVEN: I'm -- your question on the...

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen already in terms of businesses, in terms of the economy, people's lives?

HOEVEN: Yeah, I mean higher costs, not only for businesses but for individuals in terms of their health care insurance. And that's why the kind of plan that we're talking about now can create more competition and help bring health care costs down and gives people more choice.

BARTIROMO: What would you like to see in terms of other priorities for the budget?

The president released his budget. What is your response in terms of what he's likely to do in terms of raising taxes and -- and creating more revenue for things like education and infrastructure projects?

HOEVEN: Well, his budget is a real problem. And I don't believe it's going to go anywhere in Congress. If you look at it, it's $2.1 trillion in higher taxes. It's $2.4 trillion in more spending. It's $8.5 trillion over 10 years in more debt for this country. And that makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs and grow the economy. And so that's not what Americans want. That's why Congress is not going to go that direction. What we're going to try to do is do things like reduce the regulatory burden, engage in tax reform that stimulates our economy and encourages job creation for our businesses across this great country.

BARTIROMO: And how does this ObamaCare plan, or replacement plan, do that?

HOEVEN: Well, the -- it helps by giving more choice, more competition, reducing the regulatory burden -- again, not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs, giving them more options, but for individuals as well. That's the kind of thing that makes our economy go. When you make it easier to do business, then entrepreneurs, small businesses create more jobs. When you make it more expensive, you have higher tax burden, more regulation, that's what hurts job creation.

BARTIROMO: Senator, let me move on to the Keystone Pipeline, which I know you have been pushing passage for. But I want to start with North Dakota. Because North Dakota, of course, is a very big oil-producing state, producing more than a million barrels of oil a day, second largest oil producing state. What has been the impact on the state of this sharp sell- off in the price of oil that we've seen in the last year?

HOEVEN: Maria, we're starting to see some slowdown. Obviously, the price of oil now just a little over $50 a barrel. You know, actually, we're locked in a global competition to see who's going to supply energy globally. So OPEC, Russia, now the United States. You know, we're battling for market share. So we have to continue to help build our industry in this country. So far we've seen some slowdown in our state, not too much. How much more we'll see depends on what happens with the price.

BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, is it fair to say that the -- the rise in supply, whether it's the shale revolution in America or OPEC and non-OPEC countries, that's the reason oil prices have come down so much?

HOEVEN: Maria, without question, one of the things I often see is OPEC didn't decide to give us a Christmas present this year. The reason gas prices are lower, dropping over the last year from something like $3.27 a gallon down to about $2.17 a gallon is because we're producing so much more energy. And that's how it works. If we continue to grow our energy base in this country, we not only become energy secure but we reduce the price at the pump for our consumers. The benefit they've received so far would be, if it were a tax cut, would be equal to more than $100 billion in the consumer's pocket.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I mean, you have been talking about the importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and yet the president continues to say he is going to veto this. So these threats continue. What are you going to do if the president vetoes this in the next couple of weeks?

HOEVEN: You know, Maria, that's the great irony. We're producing more energy; it's strengthening our country; it's helping our allies; it's benefiting consumers and businesses, you know, throughout our economy.

And now the president, on the one hand, takes credit for it, and then, on the other hand, he is trying to block it. We need the infrastructure and we have to build the business climate so we can produce more energy, not less, here in North America. And then we don't have to depend on OPEC for oil, and we're stronger as a country and we have a stronger economy.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning the fact that the oil is going to get here by hook or crook. It's only going to come on rail cars as opposed to coming through a pipeline. And we're already seeing a real capacity congestion on the tracks, right, because oil is being transported on rail car?

HOEVEN: You make a great point. That oil is going to move either by rail or by pipeline. If it moves by rail, that's 1,400 rail cars a day which not only creates more congestion, more risk of accident, that kind of thing, but it also blocks our movement of other goods. The safest way to do it, the most cost-effective way to do it, with the best environmental stewardship, is with the proper infrastructure, the right mix of pipelines, rail and roads.

BARTIROMO: Senator, good to have you on the program. We'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much.

HOEVEN: Thanks, Maria.

BARTIROMO: Senator John Hoeven joining us.

Germany resisting calls to send weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed rebels. So what will it take to make President Putin change his ways?

An author who knows post-Soviet Russia inside and out is next, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Germany is balking at appeals by Ukraine for weapons to fight Russian-backed rebel separatists. Chancellor Angela Merkel expressing little optimism following the latest peace talks between Kiev and Moscow. My next guest knows firsthand just how corrupt post-Soviet Russia really is, having done business with some of its most powerful players. He is the author of ""Red Notice"", a true story of high-finance murder and one man's fight for justice. He is Bill Browder.

And it is good to have you on the program, Bill.

BILL BROWDER, AUTHOR: Good to see you.

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. First off, let's talk about the issues of the day. Ukraine needs help. Larry Summers was on this program last week basically saying it is more important for us to be doing helpful things for Ukraine like sending them armament than fighting Russia. Because, if you fight Russia, you're pushing Putin in a corner, and he is going to fight back even more aggressively.

BROWDER: Well, the first thing you have to know is that Putin started this war. Putin is doing this war for internal Russian domestic reasons. He's trying to distract his own population from his corruption. And so this war is not about any historic ties with Ukraine or about NATO. This is Putin aggressively attacking Russia (sic) to try to get people stirred up into a nationalist frenzy.

And so Putin will not back down in Ukraine. Anything that -- and there's basically nothing we can do to talk him into backing down, which means that the only choice we have in the West is to put pressure on him.

BARTIROMO: So do you think the U.S. should be aiding Ukraine with armaments?

BROWDER: Absolutely. I mean, so either we're going to have to go and fight Russia ourselves or let the Ukrainians fight Russia. But right now, they're getting slaughtered because Russia has an enormous amount of money to invest in military equipment; Ukraine has effectively run out of their military equipment and they need as much help as they can get.

And that's the one thing we can do without directly going to war with Russia ourselves.

BARTIROMO: All right. I want to talk about your story in particular. Because you really -- you have an inside, first-hand account. At one point in your career you were running money; you were an investment manager, and you were the single largest investor in Russia.

BROWDER: Yeah.

BARTIROMO: Tell us what happened?

BROWDER: So I was -- I was investing in Russia. I discovered that the companies I was investing in were run corruptly by corrupt oligarchs. We started to fight the corruption. That angered the -- that angered Putin and his cronies. I was expelled from the country. My offices were raided. They tried to seize my companies. And they ended up stealing $230 million of taxes that we paid.

I hired a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky to investigate. He discovered the crime, testified against the officials. He was then arrested, tortured...

BARTIROMO: In -- in Russia?

BROWDER: In Russia. He was arrested in Russia by the people he testified against. He was then tortured for 358 days in Russian custody and killed. And then, after they killed him, they then exonerated everybody involved and put him on trial, after he died, in the first ever trial against a dead man in the history of Russia. They put me on trial as his co-defendant. And we said to ourselves ""Russia is bent from top to bottom,"" after that, and looked for justice outside of Russia.

BARTIROMO: How do you know that -- and you think Putin ordered this killing of your lawyer?

BROWDER: I don't know if Putin ordered this killing, but I can say with 100 percent certainty that Putin has been involved in the cover-up of his murder. And we have evidence of that. So here you have the president of a country where his -- it wasn't my money that was stolen. It was his own tax money that was stolen from his own Treasury; $230 million stolen from his country. A young man tries to be patriotic. That young man is killed for exposing it. And then he's involved in the cover-up of that young man's murder.

BARTIROMO: So what does this -- your experience tell you about dealing with Putin and about dealing in, you know, post-Soviet Russia?

BROWDER: Basically, what this tells you is that Putin is a criminal, first and foremost. He's running a criminal enterprise to maximize profits. He's a criminal, but he's different than the Mafia of Italy or the Mafia of -- of New York in that he has all the powers of a sovereign state. He can arrest people; he can go to the United Nations. He has a -- he has his finger on a nuclear button if he wants to use that. So you have a Mafia boss with his finger on a nuclear button.

BARTIROMO: And yet you have this popularity ranking that keeps coming out, that the people love him. Is that a complete lie? Are they just afraid?

BROWDER: Well, let me ask you this. If you were living in Russia, a totalitarian state, and where bad things happen to people who oppose the president, and some stranger calls you up from the Levada polling agency and says, ""Do you support the president or not,"" what's your answer going to be?

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I -- I understand.

So where do you think this goes? In terms of Putin and Russia taking over Crimea, moving further into Ukraine, what are your expectations of how this plays out?

BROWDER: Well, so I think the whole thing is based on the fact that Putin is a kleptocrat and he needed something to distract the people. And so he needed to start a war to -- to get everyone whipped up into a big nationalist frenzy.

They're in a nationalist frenzy that -- and in response to that, there's an economic crisis because of sanctions. And so he's got to whip people into a further nationalist frenzy. And so I don't think -- so he's not going to back down from Ukraine.

And my fear, and I think this is very likely, is that he's going to start exploring his military ambitions in other countries. And the thing that's most worrying is the Baltics. Because the Baltics are part of NATO. And NATO is -- is an organization in which the United States and Europe are all treaty members, which means that, if he goes into the Baltics, we have an -- either an obligation to fight Russia to protect the Baltics or NATO falls apart.

BARTIROMO: Quite extraordinary. Bill, the book is ""Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and One Man's Fight for Justice."" Thank you very much for joining us, Bill.

BROWDER: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Bill Browder joining us here.

Up next, back to our top story, how should the U.S. respond militarily to ISIS at this point? Lieutenant General Dan Bolger is on deck, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: And back to our top story, as we await any word on U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller, what should the U.S. military response against ISIS be at this point?

Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger is the author of ""Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.""

Sir, good to have you back on the program.

Welcome.

LT. GEN. DANIEL BOLGER (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Hello, Maria.

BARTIROMO: What should the U.S. response be at this point?

The president will be asking for increased military authority against ISIS in the coming days.

BOLGER: Well, you -- you named one of the big things, and that's to get the domestic support of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives in Congress.

Real, real important because this is a long-term struggle.

Yes, you've seen some -- some accelerated air strikes in the wake of the death of the Jordanian pilot, Lieutenant al-Kasasbeh, a heinous execution done on film by ISIS. They don't do that just to be awful. They do that because it excites people and causes them to want to join ISIS, young -- young men, primarily, in that region.

It's a long-term struggle, Maria. And it means we've got to be in it for the long haul. And that's why that Congressional authorization is really important.

BARTIROMO: And, of course, Jordan has really stepped up, accelerating its response against ISIS.

How would you characterize Jordan's response?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, Jordan is a -- is a strong ally in that region. They're a front line state. ISIS is not something that happens around the world. It's right next door. They've got challenges right on their border.

They've had al Qaeda and ISIS operatives in their own country.

King Abdullah is himself military trained. He went to Sandhurst, the British military academy, the equivalent of our West Point. He's a -- he's a qualified Special Forces officer, he's a qualified pilot.

So when he gives the order for his -- for his military to retaliate against ISIS, he knows exactly what he's telling people to do because he's done it himself.

And I'll tell you the other thing that were not seeing. All these air strike videos are impressive, but what we're not seeing behind the scenes that's even more important is this strong effort to tigis -- target ISIS leadership.

ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was on our target list back when we were in Iraq in 2003 to '11, guys like him should to go sleep every night worrying that the door is going to get busted in and they're going to get shoot right between the eyes.

BARTIROMO: And -- and we do have the proper sort of intelligence to target that leadership, you think?

BOLGER: We're working on it. I'll tell you, this is where the Jordanians and the other states in the region come in. And they're very important.

Jordan has excellent intelligence services. Ours are good. We also have our other friends in that region to include the Iraqis and then the Kurdish militias that are part of Iraq.

Altogether, it's going to paint a picture that's going allow us to put that pressure and -- and threat to that ISIS leadership.

And it's going after their leaders that's going to -- going to do the most damage.

But again, a long, long effort. We're talking years before we see final results.

BARTIROMO: But the president is going to be asking for more military support.

Do you think that support should include boots on the ground?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, it already does. But the boots on the ground should not be Americans. We learned in our -- our campaign in Iraq in '03 to '11, as great as our young men and women are, it's very difficult for 100,000 Americans to lead a counterinsurgency and -- and build a successful state in the face of local rebels.

The right answer is for us to back the local people as they try and sort out their own problems. That's what the president is asking for. And to me, it shows that we have learned some lessons from what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.

BARTIROMO: You know, in the last two weeks or so, there has been a feeling that ISIS has become desperate, that, in fact, we have been effective in terms of, as you say, taking down some of the leadership.

But as a result, they have begun to falter.

Do you agree with that notion?

BOLGER: I do not. One of the things you've got to watch in a country like Iraq, it's natural for the enemies there to take a little bit of a break when the weather gets rainy, as it does in their winter there. It's not as extreme as winter in the Northeast United States, but -- but it's definitely a change of season.

You'll see an ISIS spring offensive. ISIS has strong presence in the Sunni Arab areas of -- of Syria and Iraq and -- and they're -- it's going to take a lot of work to get them out of there.

These -- these despicable actions they're taking against people like that Jordanian pilot, they're being done to allow for recruiting. I wish it was desperation because they were under pressure, but I don't think we're there yet.

BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.

General, we'll be watching.

Thanks very much for joining us today.

BOLGER: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger.

Now, let's get a look at what's coming up on ""MediaBuzz"" top of the hour with Howard Kurtz -- Howie, good morning to you.

HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Good morning, Maria.

We've got exclusive new details of the Brian Williams debacle at NBC, including that he decided voluntarily to take a leave of absence yesterday. He wasn't pushed to do so by NBC executives.

And there is no internal investigation at NBC. It's a fact-gathering inquiry to help the network play defense.

And as we look at whether he can survive this credibility crisis at NBC, it must be particularly fascinating for you, as somebody who spent two decades at that organization.

BOLGER: Well, it's interesting. So -- so but basically what I hear you saying, Howie, is that NBC is not doing anything.

The question is, will NBC's credibility continue to come down if, in fact, Brian Williams' credibility is on the line?

KURTZ: I think what's clear here is that Brian Williams has to do more to answer the questions not just about what happened in Iraq, where he has now acknowledged peddling a false story, but other questions being raised about other parts of his reporting.

If he can't do that, then NBC, I think, is going to have to make a very difficult decision.

BARTIROMO: Howie, we'll be there in 20 minutes.

Thanks so much.

We'll see you at the top of the hour.

KURTZ: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: Howard Kurtz.

The presidential candidates show their hands. Jeb Bush defines his platform in Detroit. Chris Christie tries to pick up some overseas cred in the UK. Our panel on how they did, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures.

Join us for the panel, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We dive right in. You can't paint 2016 right now and bring in our panel. Ed Rollins is former principal White House advisor to President Reagan. He's been a long time strategist and business advisor.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: And he's a Fox News political analyst.

ED ROLLINS, POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: My apologies, Ed.

ROLLINS: No problem.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh is the former press aide to Jack Camp when Camp was the GOP vice presidential nominee. He's now president of talk radio news service and a FOX News contributor.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum. He's the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and he is the former chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers.

Good to see everybody. Thanks very much for joining us.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Can you assess for us the current playing field for 2016, Ed?

Who do you think are the real candidates at this point on the GOP side?

ROLLINS: We have got the strongest field since 1980. We have four or five very serious governors and four or five senators who will probably make the race.

I think at this point, Bush obviously has picked up the pieces of the Romney departure. He's sort of going to be the establishment candidate. He's raising a lot of money, putting a good, strong team together.

Governor Walker is getting a lot of attention the last couple of weeks. And there's several other governors who will get in here, who will basically raise the money and be very viable candidates. I think it's a wide-open field and no one has a big lead at this point.

BARTIROMO: Chris Christie is trying to get some international --

ROLLINS: He had about the worst 30 days anybody can have. He bombed his London trip, where he went off to do foreign policy; he brought press along and then he wouldn't talk to press. He got trapped in the vaccination story, which overshadowed everything else. I think ""The New York Times"" had done a real job on him last week on his expensive travel and the fact that he's made (INAUDIBLE) for only one person can travel the way he travels and that's him, being hosted by kings and Boehner (ph). So it's just -- I don't think it was a good week for him.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh?

TONY SAYEGH: Well, the only person I think who enjoys the excesses of political luxury more is probably Hillary Clinton. And we know that's the case from reports continuing to come out. They've used The Clinton Foundation like their own American Express black card. So I think in the grand scheme of things, the report from ""The New York Times"" may have been to try to blunt some of the criticism that we're hearing more and more about Hillary.

But to Ed's point, I think the governor undeniably had a bad week. But I've watched him, I've observed him run two statewide races in a very overwhelmingly Democrat state. He's always seemed to manage his way back. He's a fight for sure. So I'm not ready to count him out.

But look, as far as international trips. You have Ted Cruz now in Munich in an international security conference; Scott Walker is going to England on a trade mission. Christie did a trade mission to Canada in December that was by far more successful. So these are all good maneuvers for them. But I don't think they really define their viability in terms of the field. And it's significantly early. Obviously I think Bush from the money perspective, the organization perspective, has the advantage. But you saw in the matter of two weeks Scott Walker from one speech in Iowa, the Freedom Forum, rise almost to nearly the top of the pack. He's leading polls in Des Moines, ""Des Moines Register"" So clearly this is a very fluent field but to Ed's point a very strong field.

DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Scott Walker was at the American Action Forum this past Friday, gave a major policy address. And I was very impressed with him. I think what we'll see over the next year is, as Ed said, a big field with lots of quality candidates sorting out who can sell the access to the American dream.

They're united in their belief in small government, better economic growth, keeping taxes under control, light regulatory burdens. But believing that and convincing the American people that you can deliver that are very two different things. And that's the challenge.

BARTIROMO: And that's the point that you were making, that you can try to sell the American dream, but if people don't really think they have a shot for it to be achieved, you can't sell it.

ROLLINS: The one thing Walker has done -- and he did in the Iowa summit -- is he said here is what everybody else says they're going to do. This is what I've done. That's a pretty strong record. And some of these governors, which I think are the stars of our party, we have 31 Republican governors who have really done some interesting things. They have to go out and explain what they've done and how they've done it. That it's about leaders. This is going to be a race about leadership, who's the strongest --

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: For sure.

SAYEGH: And I think Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit, while light on specifics, actually set the right kind of theme. Reminds me of my old boss, Jack Kemp; Ed's old boss, Ronald Reagan.

You have to have the typical compassionate conservatism that we've known from the Bush family to be a mantra. You have to be able to connect on a real level with the American people in a way that they trust you have their best interest at heart before they decide to agree with your policies. And that's something I think Barack Obama, while failing in every objective measure with the economy, with serving middle class and other things in 2012, was able to convince the American people to support him again because, compared to Mitt Romney, who seemed a bit patrician and removed from the day-to-day life of the average American, he had at least their best interests at heart. And that's where I think you heard a lot of in that Bush speech which is very important.

BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.

HOLTZ-EAKIN: For '16, the interesting thing is that -- you know, we were talking -- Hillary Clinton has that problem now. She's not exciting her base. And she may be a high quality candidate, but there's a whole lot of the progressive wing that are just not enthused about a Clinton candidacy.

BARTIROMO: By the way, you said she's using the Clinton Global Initiative as a black card?

SAYEGH: The Clinton Foundation, as we've learned through a lot of investigative reports, has a lot explaining to do. And I think that her and Bill Clinton both are benefiting greatly from the generous wealth and contributions of people from all over the world. Look, I'm not suggesting it's illegal.

But if you're going to criticize Chris Christie for staying at a hotel room that cost a certain amount of money --

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- thousand dollars.

SAYEGH: -- I think you got to look into Hillary Clinton and see the kind of (INAUDIBLE) she's shown that removes her from the American people. We've learned from her contracts -- which, I don't, again, begrudge her from doing to go to speak. She's making $300,000 but she's also stipulating I'll only talk to 45 people on the rope line. This is not the populist I think the Democrats need in 2016.

BARTIROMO: All right. Hold this thought. We're going to continue this conversation.

We also have some good economic news this past week. Jobs numbers are positive and even wages have begun to move.

But can this last? Our panel on that as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. We'll be right back.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our panel is back, Ed Rollins, Tony Sayegh, Doug Holtz-Eakin.

Doug, what was your assessment of the jobs numbers on Friday?

They were better than expected, and an interesting part of the report was that wages went up. Do you believe it?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: Taken at face value, this is a strong report and one that's long overdue, quite frankly. Some reasons to be nervous are January is always tough. There's a lot of seasonal adjustment. If you think of last January, we had huge storms that depressed the economy. You're comparing it relative to things like that. So a lot of this could be in the seasonal adjustments and not carry on to February.

I think the key is to look in February and see if we get sustained wage growth, see if we get sustained job growth, and see if we can continue to see people try to come back (inaudible) and get a job.

The -- you know, the bad story of this recovery has been more Americans not working because they have given up and they're out entirely.

BARTIROMO: Right, the participation rate.

SAYEGH: And the other bad story is you have a president boasting about economic growth, which, albeit, is important and a good indicator, but meanwhile the middle class is shrinking. So they're not growing with this economic expansion that is occurring, long overdue, of course.

And that's where I think the Republicans have a sincere opportunity this year to win back the middle class in this country electorally, realign them back to the Republican side, whose policies clearly benefit the average American much more.

I mean, we've talked about this before. The president's solution to everything is raise the minimum wage and somehow reallocate wealth from -- from the top to the bottom, when, really...

BARTIROMO: Redistribute...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's all zero-sum.

(LAUGHTER)

SAYEGH: It really is growing this economy in a way that good-paying jobs are created and people can take care of themselves and live that American dream that many people feel, unfortunately, is not attainable anymore.

ROLLINS: You still have, no matter what the labor department puts out, you still have very nearly one-fourth of the country, one-fourth of the workforce who are underemployed by their standards or unemployed. That's a big number.

BARTIROMO: And -- and what good is economic growth, as you put it, when the middle class is not growing with the economic growth?

ROLLINS: Many people have taken two jobs to replace the one job they used to have. And that's...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: The president's out of ideas on how to fix it. So, I mean, it's real clear. I mean, his budget says we're not going to grow faster than 2.3 percent over the long term. That's appallingly low, below what we are now. So it's going to get worse, not better. That's hard to believe.

And so there's only -- his only approach is to double-down on strategy of let's take it from one place, put it in another place. The Republicans in this cycle have an obligation to re-explain how economies grow and how people benefit from that growth. We can't remain at 2.3 percent and meet our national goals.

SAYEGH: And you're seeing this realization, particularly, I think, in Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit. You know, he's talking about not just economic growth, which is an academic economic term, some economic opportunity and why that's important. Because growth, to people, again, in an economy that's growing but they're not feeling the benefit, is relatively meaningless, number one.

Number two, we do want a party and we do want a country that provides a safety net for people in need, and this is another Bush, kind of, play on words. And instead of saying, you know, ""Let's not trap people in dependency,"" he used the term ""a spider web of dependency"" in which you're, kind of, connoting that, once you're in there, you're stuck.

We have a president whose policies have reallocated more people than ever from the middle class into lower income and into greater government dependency. That's the Obama economic record. That's why Hillary's in trouble in 2016.

BARTIROMO: And -- and the redistribution we saw, once again, with the president's latest budget.

ROLLINS: Absolutely. When you basically have the gigantic numbers we have in entitlement and a total inability to basically adjust any of those, whatever else you try and do, you're going to be dragged down.

BARTIROMO: You say Hillary is in trouble in 2016 because of this?

SAYEGH: Well, look, you look at a -- a poll that just came out several weeks ago from Washington Post/NBC. The most important number, not the head-to-head numbers -- her name ID is high; her favorability is generally very high because she's stayed our of the limelight -- 71 percent of Americans want a different direction than Barack Obama...

BARTIROMO: Right.

SAYEGH: ... and how is she going to now, in some way, shape or form, present a new policy, a new agenda that's different than the president she served for her full term?

BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break and then, still to come, the one thing to watch in the week ahead, on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" from our panel. Back in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Back with our panel. The one big thing to watch in the upcoming week. Ed Rollins?

ROLLINS: I'm watching the Ukraine situation. If the French and -- and Merkel can't basically make some resolve with Putin, we're going to push the sanctions and obviously it's going to have long-term effects. And I think, if we put troops or we put resources into Ukraine, we're going to basically start a Cold War.

BARTIROMO: Tony?

SAYEGH: I'm looking at Scott Walker's political stock. He's obviously on the rise, but this is also adding to more scrutiny from conservatives who, when they dig a little deeper, find that there are some things about the governor, who is very successful, obviously, in battling public-sector unions, that may not sit well with the conservative base.

BARTIROMO: I'll watch that, too. Doug?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: I'm watching to see if we can pass a bill in the House, a bill in the Senate, and send it to the president. That was the promise when Republicans took over the Congress and remains unfulfilled.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, you thought Keystone would fit the bill.

(LAUGHTER)

Gentlemen, thank you very much. Great panel.

I'm watching retail sales for the month of January. We will see if that cheap oil has in fact materialized with people spending money.

The 61-year-old singer took to Twitter on Friday, after the Republican presidential candidate made ""botched"" comments about his late brother, Michael Jackson, who died in 2009.

""'Friends' don't pay tribute by peddling b.s. theories about Michael's 'loss in confidence,'"" Jackson tweeted. ""This fool Trump needs to sit down.""

""Michael's confidence was affected by the pressures, injustice and vitriol of external circumstances. Period,"" he continued. ""Name-dropping Michael don't make you cool and won't win you votes. Especially when using botched facts.""

During CNN's GOP town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday, Trump claimed he ""knew the real story"" about the legendary King of Pop, whom he considered a ""very good friend.""

""He was an unbelievably talented guy,"" the 69-year-old Republican frontrunner said. ""He lost his confidence. He lost tremendous confidence because of, honestly, bad, bad, bad surgery. He had the worst. He had people that did numbers on him that were just unbelievable. Facially, you know, the plastic surgeons.""

""He was an unbelievable talent who actually lost his confidence,"" Trump added. ""Believe it or not, when you lose your confidence in something, you can even lose your talent.""

Trump has yet to respond to Jackson's tweets.

Earlier this month, Michael Jackson's 17-year-old daughter, Paris, took to Instagram to slam haters for the ""f**king ridiculous"" expectations they have regarding her activity on social media.

""The expectations for my DAD were f**king ridiculous,"" she explained. ""He didn't owe you anything, yet he was ripped to shreds DAILY. I will not let that happen to me.""

foxnews,2016-02-22 00:00:00,American businessman held in Iran reportedly denied access to lawyer,[],"An Iranian-American businessman detained by Iranian authorities since October has been prevented from seeing his lawyer, according to Reuters.

Siamak Namazi, 44, was detained by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps while visiting family. Namazi immigrated to the U.S. in 1983 and returned to Iran after graduating college to serve in Iran's military.

Iranian authorities have not publicly announced any charges against Namazi. However, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, who claimed to be Namazi's attorney, said in a phone interview with Reuters Friday that he had not received permission to see his client. Iranian law requires permission from the country's judiciary chief for lawyers to contact clients accused of national security-related crimes.

""Not me, nor any other lawyer has received such permission from the head of judiciary so far,"" Tabatabaei told Reuters. ""His mother has met him a few times, but his father has not been allowed to see him.""

Reuters also reported that Namazi's mother, Effie, said that she had learned from her son's cellmate's family that Siamak had begun a hunger strike.

""As a mother I ask officials to at least allow for me and his father to meet with Siamak as soon as possible and jointly convince him to quit his hunger strike,"" she wrote on Facebook.

The report comes a month after four other detained Americans were freed by Iran as part of a prisoner swap with the U.S. Another American, Robert Levinson, is also believed to be imprisoned by Iran.

Georges-Hunt finished with 19 points and seven assists.

Georgia Tech picks up its fifth conference win this season.

foxnews,2016-02-20 00:00:00,"America, we could be looking at a Trump, Clinton contest","['Jessica Tarlov', 'Douglas E']","For the first time in months, it wasnt just a big night for political outsiders.

After a virtual tie in Iowa and a blowout in New Hampshire, Hilary Clinton needed to show that she could turn out voters, that her message was resonating and that there was an end  or at least a pause  in Bernie Sanderss momentum.

In Saturdays Nevada caucus she certainly showed that.

With polls showing a tightening race in the past few days after she led by over 25 points just six weeks ago, it was possible that Sanders couldve pulled this out. But the Clinton firewall of African-American voters was out in full force as they voted for her three-to-one -- an excellent sign as she heads to South Carolina where over 50 percent of the electorate is black and she is heavily favored to win.

No one has doubted the strength of Sanderss message focusing on the rigged economy, reining in Wall Street, offering universal health care and tuition free college with liberal voters. Saturday in Nevada the Vermont senator still won with those who identified themselves as liberal and voters under 45 who went for Sanders three- to-one. He also far surpassed expectations with Latinos, showing that his message can resonate with minority voters.

But Clinton won handedly with moderates, which adds to the argument that shes more electable come November. And she won, critically, with women  a voting bloc that she has been rapidly losing over the last few months. This is especially significant after the comments by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem just two weeks ago that exposed a large gulf in the way that younger women look at feminism  and Clinton herself  as compared to women of Clintons generation.

Furthermore, Clinton showed that she has figured out a winning formula for how to be associated with Obama successfully: she won over 75 percent of voters who want to continue his policies. This also certainly helps her to keep the black vote as we go through the primaries.

Sanders isnt stopping anytime soon, but Saturday really couldn't have gone better for Clinton.

And the same could be said for Donald Trump who won the South Carolina primary decisively.

Hot off a feud with the pope and a few polls showing his lead under 10 points in South Carolina and even narrowing nationally, there was talk that Trump would win, but not by as much as had been projected.

But the South Carolina voters had something else in mind.

Trump won with retirees, military personnel and veterans and Evangelicals amongst other groups.

We must consider how astounding it is that Ted Cruz couldnt win in a state like South Carolina with such a large born-again Christian voter base. And that of the entire field of GOP candidates  including Cruz and Carson, two devout Christians  that Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed Trump.

Or that Trump could go after President George W. Bush in a state where Bush has over 80 percent favorability and who campaigned for his brother on Presidents Day and not be hurt whatsoever.

Saturday night also brought the news that Jeb Bush, once the frontrunner, has dropped out of the race. The question now is if the establishment will finally accept that Trump is on the path to become the Republican nominee. The rest of the primary states are much more favorable to Trump than New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he won handedly.

We could very well be seeing a Trump/Clinton general election match-up.

Now wont that be fun?

foxnews,2016-02-21 00:00:00,Toyota follows Cup title with 1st Daytona 500 victory,[],"Oh, what a feeling!

Toyota notched its first Daytona 500 victory Sunday, winning ""The Great American Race"" three months after its first NASCAR Sprint Cup championship.

""This is very difficult for me to put in words. I cannot articulate adequately what this means to Toyota,"" said David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development. ""It's our single biggest race in our company's history. I'll put it in front of the Indy 500, which was a pretty special one back in 2003.""

Gil de Ferran delivered Toyota the Indy 500 victory. Denny Hamlin provided the Daytona 500 win.

""For me, the most enjoyable thing out of winning is seeing people that invest with you, all the time and the resources that they put with us,"" said Joe Gibbs, Hamlin's team owner. ""Then to see them win and be that happy, get a chance to celebrate, it's really a thrill for me.""

When Toyota made its Cup debut in 2007, many thought the Japanese automaker would find quick success because of its deep pockets. But the road to victory lane was far from smooth.

Michael Waltrip Racing, Toyota's flagship team, was busted for cheating during the 2007 Daytona 500. High-profile Red Bull Racing struggled to make races and ultimately left NASCAR after four full seasons. And Toyota's third team, Bill Davis Racing, was mostly an also-ran.

""It's heart-wrenching that none of the freshmen class are still with us,"" Wilson said. ""That's not the end of the story that any of us wanted to see. But again, it goes to how difficult, how competitive the sport is.

Toyota's fortunes changed dramatically when Joe Gibbs Racing switched from Chevrolet in 2008.

""They took a chance on Toyota,"" Wilson said. ""Look at where they were. Three-time champions. They took a chance on us. The pressure that put on our shoulders to deliver was enormous. I hated that it's taken us this long.""

Toyota dominated Speedweeks. Hamlin won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, eight days after winning the exhibition Sprint Unlimited. And Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch, the reigning Cup champion, won one of the two qualifying races.

Toyota also claimed four of the top five spots in the 500, with Martin Truex Jr. finishing second, Busch third and Carl Edwards fifth.

It was the kind of finish many, including Wilson, thought would happen years earlier.

""We knew it was going to be a long, tough slog,"" Wilson said. ""I'll admit that I thought within the first five years we might have a shot at a championship. I think the first time I cried in this sport was 2010 when Denny came to Homestead with a 15-point lead and we lost. Had he won, we would have made that five-year target.

""Like in life, when you go through trials, you have the emotion and the heartache, and when you do achieve a level of success, it truly is sweeter. Perspective truly is a wonderful thing to have.""","['wilson', 'daytona', 'title', 'follows', 'cup', 'toyota', 'winning', 'thought', 'won', 'victory', '1st', 'team', 'racing', '500']"

Gratuitous. Nasty. Petty. Spiteful. Insulting. Just plain rude. When the rhetoric of a major partys leading presidential candidate falls to this level, we should be scornful.

So, how is it OK when it isnt just a presidential candidate, but a president, who does it?

Donald Trumps policy of demeaning and snarking his political opponents has been a favorite habit of President Obama for the last eight years. Obama is perhaps the first president who believes that leading the country and playing to the beliefs of the extremists in his own party amount to the same thing, and like Trump fans, Obama fans are motivated in large degree by sheer hatred.

They love to hear their idol channel their rage by bashing people they dont like.

Obamas latest, silent insult  leaving a spokesman to explain he had better things to do on a Saturday than attend the funeral of a 30-year justice of the Supreme Court  isnt surprising when you consider the mean-spirited things he says virtually every time he steps in front of a microphone.

This week Obama spokesman Josh Earnest bashed Sen. Chuck Schumer, who objected to cuts in counterterrorism funding for New York. Earnest said, in essence, why listen to this fool on anything if he opposed the Iran deal, especially since most Democrats were in favor?

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, accurately, that this was pure politics  the president was punishing New York to get back at Schumer.","['hits', 'fans', 'things', 'isnt', 'heights', 'spokesman', 'schumer', 'york', 'rudeness', 'scalia', 'president', 'obamas', 'presidential', 'leading', 'obama']"

The Rojiblancos slipped eight points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona after failing to unlock a stubborn Villarreal side, and have an inferior head-to-head record with the Catalans.

However, Simeone tried to paint a positive picture after the stalemate, despite managing just two wins from their previous five La Liga matches.

""Everything in life is how you want to see it. We're six points ahead of Villarreal and for us that's positive,"" said Simeone.

""If you focus on the objectives we set out for ourselves at the start of the season we are on the right track, and apart from Barcelona, who are different from the rest, it's difficult for everyone else, Real Madrid, Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, etc.

""The second part of the season is always hard as every team needs to win games and it makes it harder for everyone to reach their objectives.""

Simeone also said he had few complaints about his team's performance.

""I would have liked to have won the game, we tried to do that and get the three points, but Villarreal are one of the best teams when it comes to defending and they counter well,"" he added.

""In the second half they had counters and could have won the game with them. We tried to win the game, we maintain our points gap with them and so from one point of view it's positive.""

Atletico midfielder Koke, meanwhile, vowed to keep on fighting to catch Barcelona.

Speaking to Canal Plus, Koke said: ""We're going to keep on working, game by game. We've got the Champions League match up next, then we're going to the Bernabeu, where we'll try to play well and fight to catch up with Barcelona. We're going to fight to get to the top.
