msnbc,2016-02-19 13:36:00,Army reservist sues 'Muslim free' gun range after allegedly being asked to leave,['Chris Fuchs'],"A U.S. Army reservist is suing the owners of a gun shop and range in Oklahoma who allegedly asked him to leave after he told them he was Muslim.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, accuses Chad and Nicole Neal of violating the Civil Rights Act and Oklahomas anti-discrimination laws for refusing to allow Rajaee Fatihah to use their gun range last October because of his religion. At the time, the Neals business, Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range in Muskogee County, reportedly had a sign outside saying it was a Muslim-free business, according to the lawsuit.

For an establishment to ban someone based on their religion isnt just reprehensible  its against the law, Veronica Laizure, civil rights director for the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement. We hope that these owners and others around the country will comply with civil rights law and stop refusing service to customers in this manner.

RELATED: Jeb Bush tweeted a photo of a gun, because America

The Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), of which Tulsa-native Fatihah is a board member, filed the lawsuit along with the American Civil Liberties Union in Oklahoma and the national ACLU.

Last year, CAIR brought a similar complaint against Florida gun store owner Andy Hallinan, but a federal judge dismissed it in November, saying the organization did not prove its members were harmed by the stores policy.

Robert J. Muise, senior counsel of the American Freedom Law Center, which represented Hallinan and now the Neals, told NBC News in a statement Thursday that the center hasnt had a chance to review the lawsuit in detail because the Neals had not yet been served, but added that such litigation weakens local and national security.

Not only do our clients have a right to refuse to serve someone they believe to be a public safety risk, they have an obligation to their other customers, employees, and the community to do so, Muise said.

Muise told the Guardian Wednesday that the Muslim-free sign outside the Neals business is protected free speech, and that Fatihah was asked to leave not because of his religion but because he was belligerent, an accusation Fatihah denied.

The only thing the law prohibits is if somebody denies services strictly on the basis of religion, and that didnt happen here, Muise told The Guardian.

According to Fatihahs lawsuit, Nicole Neal asked Fatihah to fill out a liability waiver when he asked to use the range on Oct. 23. After signing it, Fatihah told Nicole Neal he was a Muslim, prompting her to summon her husband, the lawsuit alleges. The Neals then allegedly armed themselves with handguns and asked Fatihah, who enjoys recreational shooting and wanted to practice, if he had come to the gun range to commit an act of violence or as part of a jihad, according to the lawsuit. Fatihah was then asked to leave, he alleges.

Fatihah, who works as an investigator for the state of Oklahoma, is asking the court to order the Neals to comply with the Civil Rights Act and Oklahoma common law and is seeking monetary damages for mental and emotional distress.

msnbc,2016-02-22 11:20:00,Ohio's Kasich slashes Planned Parenthood funding,[],"As the field of Republican presidential candidate shrinks to just five people, John Kasich has adopted a rather specific posture: hes the grown-up in the room. The rest of the field includes two first-term senators and two political amateurs, leaving the Ohio governor as the only candidate stressing qualities such as executive experience, governing skills, and pragmatism.

And that makes perfect sense given the circumstances. Kasich cant be as right-wing as his rivals; he cant be as unhinged as his rivals; and he certainly cant avoid the career politician label. Looking for an opening, the Republican governor has decided to present himself as a more mainstream, and more electable, conservative.

In the five-person GOP field, that leaves Kasich as the last option for the partys remaining moderate voters. But lets not mistake perceptions for reality. As we were reminded over the weekend, the Ohio Republican may be playing the role of 2016 pragmatist, but that doesnt make him an actual moderate

Republican presidential hopeful and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday signed a bill that aims to strip funding from Planned Parenthood in the state. [...] After Kasich came in a strong second place in the New Hampshire primary, the Republican assembly in Ohio passed legislation that targets about $1.3 million in funding for Planned Parenthood in the state. That money helps support screenings for breast cancer, STD testing, programs working to prevent violence against women, and more.

Remember, were not talking about public funding of abortions, which is already largely prohibited. Rather, state lawmakers passed a measure to block any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions from receiving funds for womens health treatments that have nothing to do with terminating pregnancies.

And Kasich, eager to curry favor with his partys far-right base, eagerly signed the bill into law.

The NBC affiliate in Columbus reported that Planned Parenthoods work in Ohio will continue, but its community health programs would be cut. The group says programs targeted in the bill helped Planned Parenthood in the last year to provide more than 47,000 STD tests and 3,600 HIV tests to Ohioans, serve nearly 2,800 new or expectant mothers, and inform young people and women about healthy relationships.

In other words, in practical terms, John Kasich decided to slash services for thousands of Ohio women, for no substantive reason, with a simple stroke of his pen. The public will pay a steep price because the governor wants to advance his ambitions.

This is what passes for moderation among GOP presidential candidates in 2016.","['slashes', 'ohios', 'john', 'funding', 'programs', 'parenthood', 'state', 'planned', 'kasich', 'ohio', 'republican', 'presidential', 'women']"

msnbc,2016-02-22 12:37:00,Supreme Court holds first session after Justice Scalia's death,['Pete Williams'],"Chief Justice John Roberts began Mondays Supreme Court session  the first since Antonin Scalias death  with a tribute.

Roberts noted that the black drapery on Scalias chair and his spot on the bench signifies a period of mourning the loss of our friend and colleague. The seat will remain draped for roughly the next month.

It was a somber and emotional return to business for the court which is expected to hear 10 cases over the next two weeks, including a challenge to restrictions on Texas abortion clinics on March 2. Scalias unexpected death earlier this month brought the future of the courts ideological makeup into sharp relief as a partisan showdown over his replacement on the bench looms.

Monday, however, was a day of reflection for the court.

His love of knowledge drew him to academia, and then into life in the law, Roberts said.

Roberts noted  to laughter in the courtroom  that Scalia argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court in 1976. He prevailed, establishing a perfect record before this court.

Scalia was the 103 justice on the court and wrote 292 majority opinions.

He was also known on occasion to dissent, Roberts joked.

When President Barack Obamas Afforable Care Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015, Scalia struck back at the majoritys ruling as pure applesauce and interpretive jiggery-pokery.

Roberts called Scalia, Our man for all seasons, and we will miss him beyond measure.

The black drapery at Scalias spot on the bench will remain for 30 days. After that, the justices will shift around to establish the new order of seniority, with Anthony Kennedy as the senior associate justice.

A spot will remain open at the end of the bench for the next justice to occupy, once nominated and confirmed.

msnbc,2016-02-22 13:02:00,Pound drops as London Mayor Boris Johnson backs 'Brexit' from EU,['Alastair Jamieson'],"LONDON  Britains pound currency plunged in value against the dollar Monday after mop-haired London Mayor Boris Johnson dramatically defected to the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.

The high-profile announcement dealt a serious blow to Prime Minister David Cameron ahead of the June 23 referendum that could see Britain vote to exit the trading bloc.

It was followed by a string of similar announcements by other senior ministers in Camerons Conservative government, adding to fears that a so-called Brexit is now a real risk.

I think there is genuine worry that Britain might vote to leave and the uncertainty is going to rise into the referendum, Alvin Tan, a strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London, told Reuters.

The pound fell nearly 2 percent at one point to a one-month low of $1.4133, putting it on track for its biggest daily percentage loss since May 2010.

It also fell sharply in early trading against the euro, underscoring jitters about a referendum that polls suggest could be a close-fought battle.

The New York-born mayors endorsement immediately gave the Brexit campaign a huge boost, although he is not the movements official leader or even its most senior backer.

RELATED: The crisis ahead for the EU after Paris

Johnsons buffoonish upper-class persona  he once dangled on a broken zip line waving two British flags  masks a shrewd politician and he is viewed as a possible successor to Cameron. Pursued by a gaggle of reporters as he cycled from his home early Monday, he pledged to promote Britains great future outside the EU as he enjoys his final weeks in office as mayor.

Polls published before Johnsons move suggest the in campaign to keep Britain in the EU has a narrow lead over the out movement, but about one-fifth of voters remain undecided.

The issue has divided not only voters but also political parties: House of Commons lawmakers have been given a free vote to campaign along personal, not party lines.

A Brexit would strip the EU of its second-largest economy and a major military power, adding to its woes amid Europes migration crisis and the collapse of the Greek economy.

The EU can do things that NATO cannot, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said Monday, arguing that Britain could not survive alone. At the moment our defense and security rests on NATO, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security.

Other pro-Europeans, including former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have warned that an exit could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another independence vote in less-skeptical Scotland.

In a 2,000-word article explaining his decision, Johnson said his beef was not with Europe but with the EU itself, which he said was a political project that was increasingly undemocratic.

Britain needs to be supportive of its friends and allies  but on the lines originally proposed by Winston Churchill: interested, associated, but not absorbed; with Europe  but not comprised, he wrote.

Cameron, who last week negotiated new terms for Britains membership of the EU, is tasked with persuading voters that the U.K. would suffer financially if it quit.

He has received the backing of business leaders, according to the Financial Times which reported Monday that 100 CEOs were ready to publicly endorse the in campaign.

msnbc,2016-02-22 13:43:00,Trump needs his 'own damn bucket' to waterboard: Ex-CIA chief,['Ken Dilanian'],"If Donald Trump is serious about wanting to waterboard terrorists, hed better bring his own bucket, former CIA director Michael Hayden says, because the CIA isnt going down that road again.

Haydens pithy line, which he first uttered in a Showtime documentary and repeated to NBC News, underscores a serious issue: The GOP front-runner has vowed to bring back torture if he becomes president, but current and former CIA officials say the agency feels so burned by what happened when its post 9/11 interrogation program was exposed that it would refuse any such orders.

Multiple investigations, grand juries, presidential condemnations and congressional star chambers have a way of doing that to you, Hayden, who was CIA director at the end of the George W. Bush administration, told NBC News.

He then offered an even stronger version of his Showtime quote. Like the man said, if you want somebody waterboarded, bring your own damn bucket.

Trump said Wednesday he is convinced that torture works, so he would bring back waterboarding and much stronger methods. Other Republican candidates havent been as explicit, but some have called for bringing back the harsh interrogations that were repudiated by President Obama when he took office.

RELATED: Trump hails torture, mass killings with pigs blood ammo in SC

But current and former CIA officials, including some who played key roles in the post-9/11 terrorist detention program, say the fallout from that controversial episode has left the spy agency unwilling ever again to conduct coercive interrogations. That would be true, they say, even if the country was attacked again and Congress undid the law it passed last year banning harsh techniques.

I cant imagine anyone volunteering to do it, said Bill Harlow, a former CIA spokesman who coordinated a response to the Senate report and has co-authored the memoirs of several former senior CIA officials.

At issue is whether the U.S. could reprise the brutal interrogations the CIA carried out on al Qaeda operatives after the 9/11 attacks, including the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, which was used on 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two others. Other coercive techniques included sleep deprivation, slapping, humiliation, nudity, fear and isolation, often used in combination.

There is stark disagreement over whether the techniques worked, but polls show public majorities believe they did.

The CIA personnel who supervised and carried out so-called enhanced interrogations on 39 prisoners at secret sites abroad after the September 11 terror attacks were subject to lengthy criminal investigations that required them to hire personal lawyers. Their internal correspondence was laid bare in a Senate report that accused the CIA of repeatedly lying about the nature and effectiveness of the techniques. Some CIA personnel were publicly pilloried.

All that happened even though the interrogation program was ordered by President Bush and sanctioned by Justice Department lawyers.

The legal opinions in question were later repudiated as flawed, and some experts believe the harsher techniques were never lawful. The Senate report concluded that the techniques were more brutal than the CIA let on, and that they didnt produce unique and life-saving intelligence. FBI officials  who refused to participate  also concluded the techniques didnt work. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.-California), the architect of the report, called the CIA program a stain on our values.

The CIA officers involved vehemently disagree  and they feel betrayed.

RELATED: The GOPs pro-torture posture comes into sharper focus

Hundreds of them still work at the CIA, noted John Rizzo, a former top agency lawyer who helped negotiate the interrogation program with the White House and Justice Department.

They feel, he said, that they did what was asked of them to stop terrorism, and after the political winds changed, they were vilified as `torturers and `war criminals  just for doing their thankless and dangerous jobs to keep the country safe.

And now, under a Trump administration, said Rizzo, many of these same CIA career officers would be ordered to go down  perhaps double down  on that perilous path again? Who could blame for them for refusing to expose themselves and their families to a reprise someday of the ordeal they have had to endure? I hope and trust no CIA director  or its lawyer  would countenance such an order.

President Obama banned the techniques when he took office, and Congress last year enshrined that ban into law.

The CIA no longer conducts its own interrogations, and a relatively small number of terrorism suspects have been captured alive during the Obama administration. Some intelligence officials find irony in the fact that many thousands have been killed by drone missiles or bombs.

But though many CIA officers believe it makes sense to capture and grill terrorists beyond the strictures of the U.S. Army field manual, which is the current standard  they want no part in doing so.

They didnt expect people in their own government to turn on them, and they didnt expect people in Congress to develop amnesia about what they were briefed on, Harlow said.

Some lawmakers have said they were misled about the techniques when briefed in secret, something CIA officials dispute.

When the Obama administration made public the once-secret legal memos authorizing the techniques in 2009, Hayden, whose memoir, Playing to the Edge, is to be published next week, described it as a breach of faith that would, over the long term, cause CIA officers not to take certain actions.

On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly spoken about how he would treat terror suspects. He has also called for killing the family members of terrorists, which experts say would be a war crime.

Trump wants to bring back including waterboarding and much stronger interrogation methods he hasnt named.

The U.S. should respond to ISISs grisly brutality in kind, he says.

RELATED: Donald Trump: Torture works

Believe me, it works, Trump said. And waterboarding is your minor form. Some people say its not actually torture. Lets assume it is. But they asked me the question: What do you think of waterboarding? Absolutely fine. But we should go much stronger than waterboarding. Thats the way I feel. Theyre chopping off heads. Believe me, we should go much stronger, because our countrys in trouble. Were in danger. We have people that want to do really bad things!

His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reluctance of intelligence officials to reboot enhanced interrogation.

No other candidate has gone as far as Trump, but some Republicans have declined to rule out bringing back harsh techniques. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has said he would capture terrorists, bring them the prison at Guantanamo, and find out everything they know, though he hasnt said how.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who first appeared to take a stand against brutal interrogations, later said waterboarding isnt torture, and he declined to rule out using harsh techniques.

Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel for Human Rights Watch, says its worrisome that major GOP candidates are calling for resuming torture. This wouldnt be happening had the Justice Department prosecuted some of the perpetrators instead of declining to file charges, she said. Shes not confident the law on the books would prevent a future president from ordering torture in some form.

Weve seen in the past that certain administrations have tried to figure out creative ways to get around those rules, said Pitter, and its possible that another administration will do so again.

One wrinkle is that many Americans appear to be closer to Trump than to Obama and Pitter on the matter.

Polls show that a majority of Americans think the treatment of terror suspects by the CIA was justified, even if the word torture is used to describe that treatment.

If there ever was another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, many Americans might demand that terror suspects be captured and made to talk.

But who would make them? Not the CIA, Hayden and other current and former officers say.

Cheat me once, shame on you, Hayden said. Cheat me twice....

When other parents called to ask where they bought them, JoAnn and Christi realized they might have a marketable product. And Locker Lookz was born.

While the idea was easy and fun, the process of taking that idea and turning it into a business was quite difficult.

Your Business chronicled the process that followed, which led the duo from a marketing consultant to a trade show to a manufacturer to a retail buyer. With a contract to purchase based on their homemade craft items, they identified a broker to find a factory in China, produce prototypes, negotiate terms and delivery, and finally find a fulfillment to deliver the final order to the retail stores. Despite a few stumbles and missteps, JoAnn and Christi got through their first year, and Locker Lookz has since taken off.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER



Its now been two years since we first met JoAnn and Christi, and they are still very much in business. They have since partnered with a wholesale craft supply company, Darice, which allows them focus their efforts in the areas they most enjoy. We are still very involved from a product development and creative standpoint, but without all the heavy lifting, they said in an email to msnbc.

More exciting still, they have added a new line of products for decorating tween-age bedrooms called Room Lookz. The line offers colorful products like pillows, mirrors, lamps, and desk items to appeal middle school-age girls.

In February 2015, JoAnn and Christi attended the annual Toy Fair in New York City, where they introduced their new Room Lookz line alongside the latest items for Locker Lookz.","['joann', 'room', 'business', 'christi', 'items', 'locker', 'products', 'line', 'retail', 'lookz']"

msnbc,2015-02-06 18:45:00,Where Are They Now: Monterey Makeover,['Frank Silverstein'],"In May 2014, we traveled to the famous Fishermans Wharf in Monterey, California to answer two viewers call for help.

JOE & MARY DELECCE

Joe and Mary Delecce have successfully run four separate jewelry shops on the Monterey pier for over 15 years. Their son, who asked not to be named, wrote to us because he was afraid the stores wouldnt be able to support Joe and Marys retirement.

My parents gave everything to give us a leg up in our world and never asked for something in return, the Delecces son said. They are 64 and 65 years old  without a retirement nest egg. With nothing to fall back on, the Delecces needed a new strategy.

ENTER: YOUR BUSINESS SWAT TEAM

Our goal was to transform this business into a rock-solid nest egg for retirement.

First, we reached out to Chris Myers, founder of BodeTree, a Denver-based financial software company. Chris synced up the Delecces accounting system, Quickbooks, with his BodeTree analytics software. With it, he identified the strong and weak areas of the business and helped Joe and Mary create a plan to double their companys valuation to $1.2 million.

Chris passed his financial analysis on to Helen Bulwik, a retail specialist and partner at San Francisco-based Newport Board Group. Helen advises top retailers like Macys and Nordstrom, and she volunteered to help the Delecces.

Helen saw two key problems with this business: The Delecces maintained a very large payroll, as they staffed four separate shops, and they had too much inventory tying up their working capital.

Helen identified that Joe and Marys silver store brought in almost 50 percent of sales, yet took up 70 percent of their inventory. She suggested Joe and Mary cut their inventory in half. One of their biggest rules for buyers at Macys is to reduce assortments, not expand them, Helen explained. [They] identify top-selling items and eliminate everything else.

In order for the Delecces to track which styles were selling fastest, we brought in Dawn Brolin, CPA. Thanks to a donation from the Intuit Reseller Program, Dawn provided the Delecces with a brand new point-of-sale (POS) system that will allow the Delecces to tag every single item in the store and track whats selling out and when.

Helen also surprised the Delecces when she pointed out that their money-saving practice of buying loose pearls and stringing them themselves might actually be a selling point to their customers. She suggested that instead of stringing pearls in the back of the store, the Delecces should make the process visible to customers. Bring it out front to entertain the customers, and it will boost your sales, Helen said, identifying the practice as retail-tainment.

DOWNSIZING  AND UPGRADING

Helen also suggested the Delecces consolidate their four locations. She introduced interior designers Michael Bodziner and Amy Taylor of architecture and design firm Gensler. Michael and Amy drew up plans and suggested a new name for the single store: Monterey Bay Jewelry Company. Their plans called for a special booth out front so the pearl-stringer could be used to attract new customers while demonstrating his craft.

The Gensler plan also called for updated furniture to modernize the look. To offset the cost of the new jewelry cases, Helen arranged for Premier Store Fixtures to provide the custom-made cases at no cost.

To pay for the remainder of the store makeover, the Delecces sold off some of their less popular inventory at a discount  and made nearly $100,000 to reinvest in their store.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: NINE MONTHS LATER

The Delecces are now busy preparing for their grand re-opening, slated for March 2015. They chose one store to expand and act as their sole location going forward. While that is under renovation, they are also cleaning out their other storefronts and preparing them to be leased to new tenants.

The Delecces loved the new name Monterey Bay Jewelry and submitted the plans for the new sign to the city planning commission. They received notice that the new sign was approved and displayed it on their storefront in February.

The new display cases from Premier Store Fixtures arrived, and Joe says they are even more beautiful than they looked in the drawings. The Delecces have begun to integrate the inventory from the four sites, and that means weeding through thousands of items. Once everything has been cataloged into the new POS system, they will be able to track sales and focus on increasing turnover.

Its something weve been dreaming about, talking about  and now youve brought it to fulfillment, Mary said. So its really hard to say a simple thank you!","['suggested', 'monterey', 'customers', 'jewelry', 'delecces', 'makeover', 'inventory', 'helen', 'mary', 'store', 'joe']"

msnbc,2016-02-22 11:24:00,Was Trump right about Bush supporters?,"['John Lapinski', 'Josh Clinton']","With Jeb Bush dropping out of the Republican presidential race after the first three state contests, the big question is whether the move will benefit Marco Rubio. Many have speculated for weeks that if Bush or John Kasich were to leave the race, Rubio would benefit by consolidating the establishment vote. Striking a familiar contrarian tone, Donald Trump has disagreedsuggesting that he could benefit as the field winnows and Republican voters are forced to choose new candidates.

Rather than trying to parse the tea-leaves by comparing the demographics of Bush supporters to the supporters of the remaining candidates, we did something very simple: We asked Bush supporters what they thought.

According to results of the NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll that was in the field between February 8 and February 14, and which interviewed 13,129 adults, we asked respondents who their second choice would be. By looking at the second choice for the 195 Bush supporters, we can get a very good indication of how the race is likely to shake out. While the sample is relatively small, and we must be somewhat cautious in our interpretation as a result, it is only because we are interviewing so many people every week that we are able to dive deeper into the numbers to explore questions that most polls are unable to examine.

The data tells a story that is not nearly as encouraging for Rubio as some have assumed. Among Bush supporters, those who have a second place preference  and nearly a quarter of Bush supporters did not  split their preference among the field. While Rubio gets the support of 19 percent of Bush supporters, this is only slightly more than Kasich (16 percent) and Cruz and Trump are not far behind (12 percent and 11 percent respectively). While we might speculate that the support for Kasich may be a bit high given that the poll was taken following his second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, the basic takeaway is that it is not at all obvious that the departure of Bush will do much to improve Rubios base of support.

Of course, perhaps the 23 percent who do not know may all swing to Rubio, but it seems just as likely to think that they either end up splitting their support as the other Bush supporters seem likely to do  or else their enthusiasm in the rest of the field might be such that they decide to sit the rest of the primary campaign out.

It is important to note that these conclusions are based on data collected before the South Carolina Republican primary, and it is possible that the dynamics of the race have changed since the poll was taken. Maybe Trumps dominant performance, in which he won all but two counties in the Palmetto State and a perfect 50-out-of-50 delegates, attracts more supporters? Or else perhaps the fact that Rubio was able to best Cruz for second place creates more enthusiasm for his candidacy, despite the fact that he didnt win a single delegate. Regardless, our unique data suggest that it seems unlikely that a dramatic consolidation will occur just because candidates decide to exit. As is often the case, the data tell a slightly messier story than is being reported by some.

The NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll was conducted online from February 8, 2016 through February 14, 2016 among a national sample of 13,129 adults aged 18 and over, including 11,417 who say they are registered to vote. Respondents for this non-probability survey were selected from the nearly three million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Results have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.1 percentage points for the full sample and plus or minus 7.5 for Bush voters.","['right', 'trump', 'second', 'support', 'rubio', 'sample', 'field', 'bush', 'race', 'poll', 'data', 'supporters']"

Last year, a federal judge issued prison sentences to the couple, who are parents to four daughters, after they plead guilty to fraud charges.

I took full responsibility for everything, but they still put her away. I mean, I was supposed to go away, not her. And that was part of the plea. What I thought, anyway. I dont know what happened in the courtroom that day, Joe went on to say about the incarceration of his wife. Teresa is slated to be released December 23rd, and Joe is scheduled to begin serving 41 months of jail time at the end of March.

Joe said the illegal activity, which he and his wife pleaded guilty, happened before the reality TV series premiered. When asked if it was worth it, he replied, No, of course its not worth it. Im not saying I didnt do anything wrong or illegal, but there was definitely people behind [the scenes] talkin to [law enforcement officials] and telling em we did this and telling em we did that to bring it to their attention. And, you know, being in the public eye didnt help.

msnbc,2016-02-22 08:11:00,"After fighting to the end, Bill Cosby's wife will take the stand",['Safia Samee Ali'],"The deposition under oath Monday morning of Bill Cosbys wife, Camille, marks her first detailed comments since her husband was indicted on sex crimes charges in December.

A federal judge rejected the latest in a string of motions Sunday to stop the deposition in Springfield, Massachusetts, meaning Camille Cosby will have to show up to answer questions related to the allegations against her husband.

The criminal case is separate from the civil suit that requires Camille Cosbys deposition, but the two legal tracks eventually could be linked, because such depositions can be used in a criminal prosecution.

Indeed, it was a leaked deposition in another civil case that, according to prosecutors, helped strengthen the evidence to indict Bill Cosby.

While Camille Cosby has consistently defended her husband, the lawyer taking Mondays deposition, Joe Cammarata, says she should have answers to crucial questions at issue in the suit.

Did he sleep around? What were his relationships? Did he make payments of money to other women? Cammarata asked, previewing his line of questioning in a telephone interview.

Cammarata said Camille Cosbys truthful answers to those questions could support his clients claims, regardless of whether she is sympathetic to her husband.

Those topics are also highly private matters for a spouse to discuss in a civil case, which was one of the reasons Camille Cosbys lawyers argued that she shouldnt have to testify. They cited a Massachusetts rule  similar to those exists in most other states  protecting private conversations between spouses that occur during their marriage.

Camille Cosbys lawyers sought to prevent the entire deposition, arguing that it would cause embarrassment and diminish the sanctity of her marital relationship.

The goal of marital privilege laws is to insulate the intimate, trusted communications between spouses from potential meddling by the government or courts. Massachusetts lawyer Tom Lesser said such protections allow spouses to be open in their relationship, even about matters that might otherwise cause legal trouble.

Generally, if a spouse knows something based only on a private marital discussion, that testimony may be privileged. But a judge ruled earlier this month that the rule wouldnt insulate Camille Cosby from having to testify at all.

The extra wrinkle for Camille Cosby is that she isnt simply a spouse  she also served as Bill Cosbys business manager. That means she may know relevant information not based on their private conversations.

Bill Cosby has denied any wrongdoing through his representatives, who declined to comment beyond their latest filings.

Bill Cosby is suing several of his accusers for defamation, and the civil suit compelling Camille Cosbys testimony includes accusations of defamation from both sides.

While there may be skepticism that Camille Cosbys testimony would advance the case, Cammarata said she knows a great deal about her husbands life and has a serious duty to be honest.

We expect [she] will be truthful to [her] oath, Cammarata said, adding that anything less would open up her to criminal prosecution for perjury.

msnbc,2016-02-22 12:56:00,"In the race to be Trump's sole rival, Cruz's cash matters",[],"In the wake of Donald Trumps double-digit victory in the South Carolina primary, John Kasich told supporters, Tonight it became a four-person race. Around the same time, Marco Rubio declared, After tonight, this has become a three-person race. And then theres, Ted Cruz, who argued shortly before the primary that the Republican contest is a two-man race.

How clarifying.

With Donald Trump having already cruised in New Hampshire and South Carolina, its difficult to see him as anything but the current frontrunner. The question is wholl be his principal rival as the field narrows and the race enters the next phase.

Rubio, pointing to the Republican establishments gushing affections, believes hes the one for the job. Cruz, meanwhile, points to his actual performances in the early nominating contests  he won Iowa, defeated Rubio in New Hampshire, and is one of only two candidates to finish in the top three in each of the contests thus far  while making the case for himself.

This is bound to go on for a while, but dont overlook the significance of campaign financing. The New York Times has a good piece on this today.

A seven-month, $220 million surge of spending on behalf of mainstream Republican candidates has yielded a primary battle dominated by Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, two candidates reviled by most of the partys leading donors. Now, as they approach a pivotal and expensive stage of the campaign, the two insurgent candidates  who have won the first three contests  appear to be in the best position financially to compete in the 11 states that will vote on Super Tuesday, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday.

For all the Rubio hype, Cruz raised $7.6 million in January  the best showing of any Republican candidate, and nearly $3 million more than the Florida senator  and the Texan began the month with $13.6 million in cash on hand, which is also the strongest showing in the GOP field.

As Rachel noted on the show a couple of weeks ago, this is what separates Cruz from previous Republican candidates  including Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee  whove relied on evangelicals and social conservatives as a base. The Texas senator won Iowa, but he has what his like-minded predecessors did not: money.

Some caveats are probably in order. For one thing, this refers to reported campaign fundraising, but it doesnt include affiliated entities like super PACs (though Cruz is faring pretty well on that front, too). For another, we dont yet have a look at February fundraising, and its a safe bet as the Republican establishment has embraced Rubio with great enthusiasm, his coffers have swelled.

Plus, as Jeb Bush can attest, money isnt everything.

But the nature of the race is about to change. Retail politicking is key in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, where voters expect to shake your hand, look you in the eye, and kick the proverbial tires a bit, but on March 1, Republican voters will participate in 10 primaries and 1 caucus. To do well, candidates will rely less on meet-and-greet events at coffee shops, and more on advertising, field operations, and an effective campaign infrastructure.","['million', 'won', 'campaign', 'rival', 'sole', 'cash', 'rubio', 'matters', 'cruz', 'race', 'cruzs', 'trumps', 'senator', 'candidates', 'republican', 'south']"

Virginia McLaurin danced her way across the room as she met Barack and Michelle Obama as part of Black History Month.

McLaurin was born in 1909 in South Carolina and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1941, according to a community Facebook page set up for her.

She told the Obamas: I thought I would never live to get in the White House ... I am so happy  a black president.

msnbc,2016-02-22 09:43:00,Kalamazoo shooting victims were attacked seemingly randomly,"['Erin Calabrese', 'Jon Schuppe', 'Tim Stelloh']","The eight people shot by a rampaging Uber driver Saturday were cut down on what otherwise seemed to be an ordinary weekend evening.

A mother standing outside her apartment. A father and son checking out cars at a Kia dealership. A group of women and a teenage girl heading home after seeing a play.

All had the horrible luck of ending up in the path of Jason Brian Dalton, who, according to authorities, was driving around the city in a Chevrolet HHR sport utility vehicle, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, shooting people at random.

Its just a normal thing that you dont think would end in this kind of heartbreak, said Robin Buchler, superintendent of Mattawan High School, where Tyler Smith was a student.

There is no obvious motive, nothing to tie the three sets of victims together  circumstances that make the attacks particularly difficult to process, authorities said.

RELATED: Kalamazoo rampage victims were attacked doing ordinary weekend activities

How do you go and tell the families of these victims that they werent targeted for any reason other than they were there to be a target? Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeffrey Getting said.

The first victim, described by a neighbor as a mother of multiple children, was shot about 5:42 p.m. ET outside the Meadows Townhomes on G Avenue in the northeast part of the city, police said. The woman, whom officials have not identified, survived.

More than four hours later and on the other side of town, Richard Smith, 53, was looking at cars with his 17-year-old son, Tyler, at Seelye Kia on Stadium Drive, Buchler said. Dalton killed them both, authorities say.

Not long after that, a group of women and a 14-year-old girl were parked in two cars outside a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant. They were returning home after seeing a play, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said.

Four of them were in a Chevrolet Cruze: Mary Jo Nye, 60, of Battle Creek, Michigan, was behind the wheel. The 14-year-old girl was in the front passenger seat. In the back were Dorothy Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, also of Battle Creek.

Next to them, driving an Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan, was the sister-in-law  and best friend  of Mary Jo Nye: Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Michigan.

Dalton approached them, spoke to them briefly and then unloaded his weapon into both cars, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said.

All were killed but the girl, who was believed to be dead for more than an hour but squeezed her mothers hand as doctors prepared to harvest her organs, Michigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz told NBC News. She was rushed into surgery in what authorities have called a miracle.

Snyder said the girl was working hard to stay alive, according to The Associated Press.

The woman shot next to her, Mary Jo Nye, was a retired teacher who worked many years at a school that served at-risk students, a former colleague told The AP.

Tara Egnatuk, assistant director of Calhoun Community High School, said Nye helped students become better writers by taking baby steps to get them to open up. Nye played a really integral part in a lot of kids lives, Egnatuk said.

Dorothy Brown was remembered as a kind neighbor and avid vegetable gardener. When Patrick Mallon Jr., who lived next door, would go on vacation, the AP reported, Brown would tend to the familys cat and watch their home. He always returned the favor, shoveling her driveway when it snowed.

Mary Lou Nye had reached the rank of staff sergeant in the Air Force. Her son, Bart, told NBC News that his mother and aunt  Mary Jo Nye  lived together during college and had remained close.

They were really awesome, wonderful, loving people, Bart said. My mom doted on us when we were kids, and my aunt took care of us when Mom and Dad were on active duty in the Air Force.

The sisters-in-law had planned an evening out that started with dinner at Cracker Barrel, where one left her car before they headed to Miller Auditorium to see a show featuring Chinese acrobats.

That way, they only had to pay for parking for one car, Bart said, adding that once the show ended, they went back to the parking lot to pick up a car and part ways. It was at that moment that the gunman appeared and began shooting.

Barts father, Christopher, became suspicious when Mary Lou didnt call him after the show. So he began frantically dialing everyone he could to find her.

He got no answer, Bart recalled.

The next morning, the police arrived with grim news: both women had been shot dead.

Why? Bart asked. What purpose did this serve other than to shoot people?

Its just completely senseless, he added.

msnbc,2016-02-22 08:10:00,"Rubio poised to benefit from Bush's exit, with Kasich in pursuit",['Leigh Ann Caldwell'],"With former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush out of the race for President, Florida Sen. Marco Rubios team is scrambling to sweep up the supporters that made Bushs campaign the flushest, if not the most successful.

While Rubio is expected to be the biggest benefactor of Bushs exit, some donors are expressing reservations about quickly investing in another candidate with no guarantee of victory in a year where money has not dictated success.

Still, Rubio is expected to see an outpouring of support among former Bush loyalists.

Bobbie Kilberg and her husband Bill, bundlers who first backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and then signed on to Bushs campaign in the waning days, have decided to back Rubio.

He is now the candidate around whom mainstream Republicans can coalesce, Kilberg told NBC News.

Kilberg said she received phone calls or emails from nine people in her network of donors Sunday morning saying that theyd back Rubio, too.

Rubios campaign, hoping to portray a flood of finances, confirms that he has gained the financial support of former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas John Rood, who donated at least $135,000 to pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise; Former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Francis Rooney, who donated at least $2.3 million to Right to Rise; CEO of Alliance Resource Partners Joe Craft and Reverence Capital investment manager Muneer Satter. view photo essay Photos: South Carolina's Republican presidential primary Republican presidential candidates have been campaigning across the Palmetto State in anticipation of its first-in-the-South GOP primary.

The super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, notified reporters just hours after the polls closed in South Carolina Saturday that it was embarking on a stepped-up strategy to secure a crush of new financial support.

Tonights results in South Carolina make it clear that this is a three-candidates race, with Marco Rubio best positioned to challenge for the lead going forward, spokesperson Jeff Sadosky wrote.

The super PAC says it plans to engage in the next contest in Nevada as well as 11 states that vote on March 1.

It will launch a multi-state, multi-million dollar advertising effort that will begin on Tuesday, Sadosky said.

But not all of Bushs donors are immediately running to Rubio.

Bush supporter Robert Grand, managing partner of Barnes & Thornburg of Indianapolis, told NBC News hes pausing for a moment to assess the race.

And David Beightol, a cash bundler and donor for Bushs Right to Rise PAC, said, Im taking a little time out.

Beightol said he wants to support somebody who can win as well as somebody who will be a good president. Hell take those two factors into consideration and will talk to his political confidantes before he determines his next move.

Beightol said hes already been approached by several Rubio donors and said that hes run into at least one former Bush donor Sunday that plans to back Rubio.

I like Kasich a lot, Beightol said. He called Kasichs record remarkable but said he isnt sure if Kasich will catch fire, and he hasnt heard from any of Kasichs people yet.

Both Rubio and Kasichs campaigns are working hard to frame the narrative that their financial support is on the upswing.

Kasichs campaign insists that he is also benefiting from Bushs exit. Hedge fund billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has thrown his financial heft behind Kasich, as has Peter Malone, who supported Sen. John McCains 2008 bid by raising more than $250,000, NBC News confirmed.

The days of us being outspent ten to one are over because of what happened tonight, Kasichs chief strategist John Weaver told reporters Saturday after Bush suspended his campaign.

And in a memo to reporters on the state of the race, he said, As resources become more equal, Kasich will rise even more.

Any fresh infusion of cash would be welcome news to both Rubio and Kasich. As the race becomes more national in scope, it will become more difficult to compete against Donald Trump who is mostly self-financing his campaign.

At the end of January, financial disclosure documents showed that Rubio had just under $5 million cash on hand. While he raised $5 million that month, he spent more than $10 million, an unsustainable burn rate.

And Kasich, whose campaign has been more judicious whit its funds, had far less to spend. Kasichs campaign raised just $1 million in January and had only $1.4 million at the end of the month. The super PAC backing him, New Day for America, had only raised $3 million this cycle, far behind Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Rubio.

msnbc,2016-02-18 17:42:00,Is Pope Francis' contraception allowance during Zika threat a major shift for church?,['Erik Ortiz'],"Pope Francis on Thursday suggested using artificial contraception in countries afflicted with the Zika virus would be OK for women worried with how the disease is linked to rare birth defects.

Calling it a lesser of two evils, Francis indicated that choosing to avoid pregnancy altogether would be the better alternative to abortion.

Abortion is an evil in and of itself, but it is not a religious evil at its root, no? Its a human evil, he told reporters en route to Rome following his six-day visit to Catholic-heavy Latin America, which is grappling with a Zika outbreak.

On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil, he continued. In certain cases, as in this one (Zika), such as the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear.

Francis held up Pope Paul VI as an example of a sort of precedence on the issue: In the 1960s, Paul VI approved nuns in the Belgian Congo to use artificial contraception to prevent pregnancies amid the threat of rape.

But the pontiff on Thursday also urged doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines to fight the mosquitoes that harbor and spread Zika.

This needs to be worked on, Francis said.

The use of contraception is strictly prohibited under Roman Catholic Church teachings.

A passage in the Book of Genesis is often cited by scholars. In it, a son of Judah named Onan is described as wasting his seed on the ground when having sexual relations with his brothers widow, so that he doesnt impregnate her.

This form of contraception, however, upsets the Lord, who then smote Onan, the Bible says.

RELATED: Pope suggests Trump not Christian, but others back Mexico wall

Francis didnt elaborate on any specific type of contraception, but his decision to not declare an outright ban is an about-face from what Brazilian church leaders have said. Brazil is battling a rise in Zika cases.

Contraceptives are not a solution. There is not a single change in the churchs position, said Brazilian Bishop Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, according to reports.

But Francis, while not completely opening the door to contraception in other similar scenarios, appears to be building on his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

In 2009, he drew controversy for saying that condom use can aggravate the spread of AIDS in Africa.

You cant resolve it with the distribution of condoms, the conservative pope told reporters aboard his papal jet after leaving AIDS-ravaged Africa. On the contrary, it increases the problem.

But the following year, in what some reports called a seismic shift, Benedict softened his stance on prophylactics and supported the use of condoms to fight AIDS  even if it results in preventing a pregnancy.

In certain cases, where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection, it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another, more humane sexuality, Benedict said, while also extolling abstinence as the preferred method.

Francis last year declined to delve deeply into the topic of condoms.

When asked about the issue while leaving Africa after a six-day visit, he suggested the form of birth control was a mere Band-Aid solution. The continent, he said, had other pressing problems, including poverty and exploitation.

His comments were made as the Syrian opposition said it had agreed to the possibility of a temporary truce, provided there were guarantees Damascuss allies including Russia would cease fire, sieges were lifted and aid deliveries were allowed country-wide.

We have said that we are ready to stop military operations, but the issue relates to more important factors ... such as preventing terrorists from using it to improve their positions, Assad told Spanish newspaper El Pais in an interview.

RELATED: Syria cease-fire: Provisional agreement reached, John Kerry says

He also said any truce must ensure that other countries, especially Turkey, are prevented from sending more terrorists and weapons, or any kind of logistical support.

Damascus refers to all insurgents fighting against the Syrian army and its allies as terrorists.

Turkey, other Sunni regional powers and Western countries have supported insurgents fighting against Assad, whose forces are bolstered by Iran, Russia and Lebanese Hezbollah.

Asked about the possibility of Turkey and Saudi Arabia sending ground forces into Syria, Assad said: Were going to deal with them like we deal with the terrorists. Were going to defend our country. This is aggression.

Attempts to negotiate a truce in recent months have failed. The latest round of talks at the United Nations in Geneva is being jointly chaired by Russia and the United States.

World powers agreed in Munich on Feb. 12 to a cessation of hostilities that would let humanitarian aid be delivered in Syria.

The ceasefire was scheduled to start a week later, but did not take effect. Syrian army offensives continue unabated across the country, backed by Russian air strikes.

Assad said last week he would keep fighting terrorism while peace talks took place, vowing to retake the whole country.

He told El Pais his troops were now close to fully controlling the northern city of Aleppo and were advancing towards the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa province.

Once he has control of the country, Assad also said in the interview, the next step would be to form a national unity government that would lay the groundwork for a new constitution and general elections.

But 45-year-old Jason Brian Dalton will face justice from a jail cell when he is arraigned on the charges, which also include two counts of attempted murder and eight felony firearms charges.

The suspect will be appearing by video feed from the Kalamazoo County Jail, the Kalamazoo County Prosecutors Office said in a statement.

Dalton, an insurance adjuster who was moonlighting as an Uber driver, cruised around the city Saturday night picking his targets seemingly at random before he was finally captured, police said.

But investigators still havent divulge a motive for the horrific spree, which left six dead and two more wounded, including a 14-year-old girl who remains in critical condition.

A married father of two, Dalton had no police record or anything in his background that would lead us to believe he was capable of this type of behavior, Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley said on Sunday.

RELATED: Kalamazoo rampage victims were attacked doing ordinary weekend activities

Meanwhile, heartbroken Kalamazoo residents gathered Monday at St. Augustine Cathedral for a Mass in memory of the victims: Richard Smith, 53, his 17-year-old son, Tyler, both of Kalamazoo; 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye of Battle Creek; her 62-year-old sister-in-law Mary Lou Nye of Baroda; 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne and 74-year-old Dorothy Brown, both of Battle Creek.

Earlier, President Obama said he he called the mayor, the sheriff, and the police chief there and told them that they would have whatever federal support they needed in their investigation.

The attack in San Bernardino killed 14 of our fellow Americans, Obama said in remarks to the National Governors Association. And heres a hard truth: We probably lost even more Americans than that to guns this weekend alone. On Saturday, another one of our communities was terrorized by gun violence.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder ordered flags across the state lowered to half-staff for six days starting Monday  one day for each of the victims.

I met with two (victim) families in Kalamazoo yesterday, Snyder said during a press conference. What a tough situation.

msnbc,2016-02-20 09:55:00,Nevada prepares for 'First in the West' Democratic caucus,[],"LAS VEGAS -- They call Nevada the First in the West  the only state west of the Missouri River to play a determinative role in shaping who wins the Democratic nomination before the rush of Super Tuesday.

State leaders hail Nevadas demographics as a microcosm of the U.S. electorate: Increasingly diverse as minority voters inch toward becoming the majority, with Latinos carrying the torch as the fastest growing bloc of the electorate.

Just a few short months ago, it would have come as complete shock to see how down to the wire Nevadas Democratic caucus would be.

The major question question heading into Saturdays race is whether Hillary Clintons firewall of support from blacks and Latinos will be able to hold against the insurgency of Bernie Sanders campaign, built from the ground up.

Clinton came to Nevada early and hard, setting up an expansive ground game statewide before Sanders had even formally entered the race.

Her roots in the Silver State must not be underestimated. She won the popular vote in 2008  claiming key support from Latinos  only to be edged out by then-Sen. Barack Obama on the delegate count.

But riding off a virtual tie in Iowa and a win in New Hampshire by a more than 20-point spread, Sanders approaches Nevada with momentum at his back.

Days out from the Nevada caucus, polls showed Sanders whittling Clintons lead down to just a single percentage point.

On the eve of caucus day, Sanders stood with confidence before a rapturous crowd of fans and declared that 20, 30 years from now, they will look back and say this is when the revolution began.

I have a feeling, folks, that were going to make history tomorrow, Sanders said.

A stretch of low pressure associated with the same winter storm was wreaking havoc from Louisiana to Alabama, the Weather Channel reported, with possible tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hail and powerful wind gusts leaving thousands without power.

Much of the region was still shivering after a bitter blast of arctic air brought record-smashing temperatures to several cities over the weekend.

The freeze was joined by snow Sunday, with up to a foot expected through Tuesday from western Pennsylvania to northern New England, according to The Weather Channel. 

Freezing rain, ice and lesser snow accumulations were also anticipated across much of the Eastern Seaboard, with a blanket of winter storm warnings and freezing rain advisories in effect from Georgia to Maine.

Snow was also forecast in Michigan.

In Virginia, one person was killed on Monday morning after an SUV collided with a snow plow, the Weather Channel reported , while in Minnesota, slick roads caused dozens of spin-outs and two fatal accidents on Sunday night.

North of Boston, the coastal community of Revere was grappling with severe flooding: the citys floodgates were left open during the polar vortex, and frozen solid by the blast of arctic air, NBC affiliate WHDH reported.

When high tide arrived, water spilled onto the streets and surged under raised homes, creating a sheet of ice that froze pipes and sent residents to hotels, the station reported.

In Mississippi, at least two tornadoes were reported, the Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Forbes reported,and 14,000 people were in the dark,according to NBC affiliate WLBT. More than an inch of hail fell north of Baton Rouge, the Weather Channel reported, and the roof was blown off a Pizza Hut in the central part of Louisiana.

As of 2:30 pm ET, nearly 4,000 flights had been delayed or canceled across the nation. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Newark Liberty and Baltimore-Washington were the worst affected, suffering nearly 1,000 cancellations and delays, according to Flight Aware.

The snow looked likely to be short-lived in the East, however, with much of it turning to rain overnight and temperatures expected to spike to the mid-50s in Boston by Tuesday, the Weather Channel reported.

Cold weather records across the Northeast were shattered on Valentines Day after the polar vortex shot a mass of Canadian arctic air south.

Valentines Day saw temperature records tumble across the region. In Boston, thermometers dipped to minus 9 degrees  the coldest day since Jan. 15, 1957  while in New York City, Central Park registered minus 1, the lowest reading in 22 years.

Monday looked likely to be warmer  but only just  with lows between 10 to 20 degrees below average and subzero temperatures already recorded across New England in the early hours of the morning.

msnbc,2016-02-21 16:01:00,Gov. John Kasich signs bill to strip Ohio Planned Parenthood of government funds,[],"Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a bill on Sunday to divert Planned Parenthood of government funding in the state.

The expected move comes one day after the presidential contenders lackluster finish in the South Carolina Republican primary, in which Kasich placed fifth with 8 percent out of the six viable candidates.

While the piece of legislation, known as House Bill 294, does not mention Planned Parenthood specifically, supporters say the organization would be affected most by the bill. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio launched digital advertisements and videos against the governor earlier this week when the bill was sent to his desk.

The measure targets about $1.3 million in funds that Planned Parenthood receives via the states Department of Health. The funding, which largely comes from federal sources, covers cancer screenings, HIV testing and initiatives to prevent domestic violence, but the legislation would forbid funding institutions that are affiliated with abortion. Under the bill, Ohios health department must ensure that state funds and certain federal funds are not used either to perform or promote nontherapeutic abortions, or to contract or affiliate with any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions, according to a statement from Kasichs office.

Kasich signed a state budget in 2013 that reduced funding to Planned Parenthood and has signed at least 16 pieces of anti-abortion legislation since he assumed the governorship in 2011.

msnbc,2016-02-18 19:45:00,"Anxiety drug overdoses have quadrupled over last two decades, study finds",['Maggie Fox'],"More Americans than ever are overdosing on anxiety drugs, researchers reported Thursday  and its not clear why.

The new study finds not only that more Americans are taking the drugs, which include brand names such as Valium and Xanax, but that theyre taking more of them.

But while the quantity of prescriptions filled tripled between 1996 and 2013, the number of overdoses quadrupled during the same period, the team reported in the American Journal of Public Health.

We found that the death rate from overdoses involving benzodiazepines, also known as benzos, has increased more than four-fold since 1996  a public health problem that has gone under the radar, said Dr. Marcus Bachhuber of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who helped lead the study.

Overdoses from benzodiazepines have increased at a much faster rate than prescriptions for the drugs, indicating that people have been taking them in a riskier way over time.

Benzodiazepines are extremely popular drugs in the U.S.

More than 5 percent of U.S. adults fill a benzodiazepine prescription every year, for conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders and insomnia.

Theyre known to be highly addictive and, in 2013, nearly a third of the 23,000 people who died from prescription drug overdoses were taking them.

Bachhubers team looked at large health surveys to find trends in their use and abuse.

The rate of overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines increased more than four-fold from 0.58 per 100,000 adults to 3.07 per 100 000 adults, they wrote. However, this rate appeared to plateau after 2010.

Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling a benzodiazepine prescription increased 67 percent, from 8.1 million to 13.5 million, they added.

They found a similarly large increase in the number of pills each adult was prescribed.

Its not clear why overdoses went up so much. It could be people are taking the drugs for longer times, raising the odds that theyll eventually overdose. Or it could be the pills are getting to people who dont have prescriptions, the researchers wrote.

msnbc,2016-02-22 09:36:00,Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas hasn't asked a question in a decade,['Jon Schuppe'],"Ten years ago Monday, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas asked a question from the bench.

He hasnt done it since.

The streak is a record  no other justice in modern history has gone more than a term without asking a question during oral arguments. Its also a source of curiosity and angst in the legal community.

It will also likely continue for some time. Thomas has shown no sign of changing his ways, issuing his opinions in written form and making little more than small talk with other justices when the court is hearing arguments  and, once, three years ago, cracking an apparent joke.

The last time Thomas asked a question was Feb. 22, 2006, during arguments on a death penalty case.

No one knows quite why Thomas chooses to abstain as he does. Some have pointed to his prior remarks about growing up self-conscious about his rural Georgia accent. But the more likely explanation is that Thomas believes he learns more if he keeps quiet.

I just think that its more in my nature to listen rather than to ask a bunch of questions, he told high school students in 2000. And they get asked anyway.

Thomas has also said he is uncomfortable competing with the courts louder voices  which, until his death this month, included Justice Antonin Scalia.

Taking part in oral arguments is just one piece of the high courts deliberative process. Lawyers on both sides make most of their arguments in briefs submitted beforehand. Justices use oral arguments to analyze those positions and to debate indirectly with their colleagues.

Preferring silence is not unprecedented, scholars say: Justice William Brennan, for example, was famously reticent during his late career.

Stephen Wasby, political science professor emeritus at the University of Albany, said Thomas approach hurts the process.

Hes not giving the lawyers an opportunity to address his concerns. And I think he should, Wasby said. The others do. He should. Thats a legitimate concern.

But scholars point out that the courts increased volubility is more a recent development. Historically, they say, the court didnt ask many questions during oral arguments.

That makes Thomas somewhat of a throwback. Hes better known for the power of his written opinions, which reflect his conservative beliefs and originalist interpretation of the Constitution and which scholars say are proving to have lasting impact on American law. His ideas about individual gun rights under the Second Amendment, for instance, have been influential.

Ralph Rossum, a law professor at Claremont University who wrote a book about Thomas impact on constitutional law, said it wouldnt necessarily make Thomas more effective if he suddenly started to speak up.

Obviously, Thomas knows he doesnt ask questions and theres a lot of criticism that he doesnt, Rossum said. But hes confident enough in his own skin not to care. Hes going to do it his way.

msnbc,2015-03-10 14:04:00,Where Are They Now: Hangover Heaven,['Jessica Shim'],"For most, a hangover is the consequence of one too many drinks. But for Dr. Jason Burke, it was the start of a new business.

In March 2013, Your Business traveled to the Sin City to talk shop with Dr. Jason Burke, founder and CEO of Hangover Heaven. The company uses IV hydration, vitamins, and other medications to treat patients suffering from hangover symptoms. Dr. Burke, a board-certified anesthesiologist with a medical degree from the University of North Carolina, says he can treat almost 95 percent of all hangover symptoms in about 45 minutes.

In an effort to make its services as convenient and readily available as possible, the company turned an old gospel tour bus into a mobile treatment facility. Hangover Heaven also provides shuttle service to their clinic, and offers in-room treatment options.

But that doesnt mean the business has been welcomed with open arms. Some question whether or not a hangover is a medical condition that needs to be treated. To tackle that hurdle, Dr. Burke created the Hangover Research Institute to gather scientific evidence to back his claims and regularly asks clients to post on social media about their experiences.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER

According to Hangover Heaven, the company saw a 40-percent increase in 2014 revenue year over year, and expects revenue to grow in 2015 as well. Hangover Heaven has found the greatest growth in private, in-hotel-room treatment plans, thanks to the relationships it has forged with concierge services at major hotels on the Strip. Dr. Burke says his company is often called to VIP rooms to provide treatment, and recalls one instance when, after providing treatment for a VIP client, the client felt so much better that he extended his trip to Vegas an extra day.

Hangover Heaven has also expanded its clinic to make room for a designated space for the Hangover Research Institute. It continues to conduct research on hangovers and ways to treat the symptoms head on.

Dr. Burke continues to receive requests to expand his business into other cities across the globe, and is seriously considering expanding the company into other locales.","['heaven', 'business', 'company', 'hangover', 'research', 'symptoms', 'treatment', 'dr', 'burke', 'treat']"

In a show of support, Taylor Swift has donated $250,000 to Kesha to help with any of her financial needs during this trying time, a representative for Swift told NBC News on Monday.

The gift from the Shake It Off songstress follows a setback in Keshas bid to break her professional relationship with producer Dr. Luke, whom she has accused of sexually assaulting her.

#FreeKesha this is only gonna make you stronger, you brave and beautiful girl. Prayers are with you @KeshaRose  Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) February 20, 2016

A judge on Friday denied Keshas bid to end the contract with Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald. Kesha has accused Gottwald of drugging and raping her and abusing her in an effort to get her to lose weight.

Gottwald denies the allegations, saying Kesha. 28, is lying in an effort to break her contract. He has not been charged with a crime. The 42-year-old producer and songwriter has worked with artists including Katy Perry, Rihanna, Pitbull, Miley Cyrus and Kelly Clarkson.

My heart is with @KeshaRose.  Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 19, 2016

Kesha Rose Sebert was an 18-year-old unknown from Nashville when she signed a contract with one of his companies in 2005, according to court papers.

Five years later, Tik Tok was the No. 1 song in the country. She has released two albums, most recently in 2012.

There are people all over the world who love you @KeshaRose. And I can say truly I am in awe of your bravery.  Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) February 19, 2016

Kesha continues to play some shows, but her lawyers say her career is essentially being held hostage because she refuses to work with her accused rapist, and he is retaliating because she spoke up.

Fridays court decision is not the final word in the case, but an outpouring of support on social media followed from celebrities and fans, many who used the hashtag #FreeKesha.

How did I get elected? Kasich asked the crowd, recalling his first run for state Senate in Ohio in 1978. Nobody was  I didnt have anybody for me. We just got an army of people, who, and many women, who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me. All the way back, when  you know, things were different. Now you call homes and everybodys out working. But at that time, early days, it was an army of the women that really helped me get elected to the state Senate. 

Kasich made the comment while speaking to a large crowd at George Mason University during a day-long swing through the crucial March 1 primary state of Virginia.

Minutes later, a woman who identified herself as a nursing student at the university stood up and asked Kasich a question about his decision to sign a bill in Ohio Sunday that diverts funding from Planned Parenthood in the state.

Your comment earlier about the women coming out of the kitchen to support you  Ill come support you but I wont be coming out of the kitchen, she told him to some cheers and laughs from the audience.

I gotcha, I gotcha, he responded.

The governors spokesperson Rob Nichols responded to the reactions stirred up by the comments. John Kasichs campaigns have always been homegrown affairs. Theyve literally been run out of his friends kitchens and many of his early campaign teams were made up of stay-at-home moms who believed deeply in the changes he wanted to bring to them and their families, he said. Thats real grassroots campaigning and hes proud of that authentic support. To try and twist his comments into anything else is just desperate politics.

This is not the first time Kasich has come under fire for making dismissive comments during his town halls.  Earlier in the campaign, he dismissed a question from a University of Richmond female student saying, No, I dont have Taylor Swift tickets for you. He later took her question, but it set off a firestorm on social media.

msnbc,2016-02-22 10:32:00,How Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are likely to lose a Latino-heavy state,[],"LAS VEGAS  Two Hispanic candidates  the first Cuban-Americans to ever run for president  have virtually no shot this week of winning a swing state that is home to a sizable Latino population.

Instead, theyre duking it out for a distant second-place finish here on Tuesday night, light-years behind a derisive candidate who has made alienating minorities a hallmark of his candidacy.

When Nevada state Republicans adopted a caucus-style process in 2008, giving the states diverse electorate greater power in determining the next presidential nominee, the party was already in the early stages of a reckoning over how the states demographics were shifting dramatically. They needed to catch up with diverse voters or kiss chances of winning the White House ever again goodbye.

RELATED: Rubio poised to benefit from Bushs exit, with Kasich in pursuit

Flash forward, and Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are now Republicans best chance of fulfilling the partys prophecy of maintaining relevancy by becoming more inclusive toward minority voters. But that only has the potential of happening if they could only get within an arms length of the GOP front-runner  Donald Trump.

Even Rubio, who grew up here, will face significant obstacles in chipping away at Trumps resounding lead. Rubio spent six of his formative years living in a working-class white and Latino neighborhood in Las Vegas. He often jokes along the campaign trail that he has more family living in Sin City than he does in Miami, where he serves as senator and raises his kids. view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

At a campaign rally here Sunday night, Rubio pointed to the cluster of his extended family members gazing up at him on the stage, all wide-eyed and bursting with pride, to share how they together embody the American Dream.

My family started anew here in southern Nevada, a place of new beginnings, second chances and a new start, Rubio said, telling of how his dad started out working as a bar-back at Sams Town, his mother a maid at Imperial Palace back when he was 8.

Rebounding off of a virtual tie in South Carolina, Rubio and Cruz are jockeying to position themselves as the clear alternative to Trump and the inevitable candidate to whittle the field down to a two-man race.

Though there has been a dearth of reliable polls to gauge the state of the race, and Nevada caucus-goers are notoriously difficult to track, the last poll leading into Tuesdays contest had Trump claiming 45 percent of likely Republican participants. Rubio and Cruz came neck-and-neck with 19 percent and 17 percent respectively.

For Cruz, the strategy boils down to momentum and electoral math. Hed bested Trump once already  he could do it again.

In campaign stops around Las Vegas suburbs on Sunday, the subject of the Cruz familys new-immigrant roots was hardly a topic of discussion before the considerably older, whiter crowds that he turned out.

RELATED: Its a three-man Republican race

I dont know if Ted needs to roll a cigar on his thigh or what to get people to notice that hes also Cuban, television pundit and radio host Glenn Beck joked at a Cruz event in Henderson.

Nevadas Latino population grew by more than 80 percent from 2000 to 2010, triggering a massive uptick in the Hispanic share of the statewide vote. Latinos now make up 17 percent of Nevadas eligible voters, one of the highest proportions in the country thats only expected to grow.

Whats unique about the Silver State is that it has proved that Latino voters are not a monolith locked for Democrats. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, changed the game by becoming the first Latino elected as governor in 2010, handing the GOP complete control of the Nevada legislature with a number of ultra-conservatives riding on his coattails.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Ted Cruz The Texas senator was first to announce his bid back in March, and has since been carefully laying the groundwork for a come-from-behind primary victory.

Latinos turned out for the Democratic caucus at record rates on Saturday, claiming roughly 18 percent of the share of caucus-goers. The margin for Republicans will likely be far more slim.

For many Latinos, commitment to the immigrant community is more than just in a candidates last name or their ability to sell their stump speeches in two different languages.

Both Rubio and Cruz have tracked positions further and further to the right, vowing to end all of President Obamas executive actions benefiting young immigrants and even suggesting restrictions to legal immigration. Their aggressive drive to cast the other as pro-amnesty will make it extremely difficult in warming up to Latinos who care deeply about deportation policies and the need for comprehensive immigration reform.

Whether Latinos will identify with the two Hispanic candidates also depends on their roots. Cubans, as are both Rubios and Cruzs fathers, are allowed to apply for permanent residency one year after they set foot in U.S. soil. For Puerto Ricans, theyre automatically U.S. citizens at birth.

RELATED: Nevadas most powerful Latino turnout machine is sitting this race out

Thats a dramatically different life experience and set of values compared to the vast majority of the U.S. Latino population, in which immigrants from Mexico and Central America who have lived in the U.S. for years, even decades, have firm roots and families here, and yet currently no shot of earning legal status.

But it should not be understated just how remarkable it is that two Latinos are top contenders to lead the Republican Party in November. The unique and historic nature of their candidacy was captured last week when the two Hispanic candidates were bickering onstage at a Republican debate in South Carolina over who spoke Spanish better.

Instead of talking about immigration, Rubio is sticking to a message about family, growing up poor and living from paycheck to paycheck.

Absolutely. I feel like he knows where were coming from because he lived where we lived, said Las Vegas resident Silvia Kalb, whose 16-year-old daughter Sophia pressed to her to attend Rubios event on Sunday.

msnbc,2016-02-10 09:23:00,Supreme Court conservatives block Clean Energy Plan,[],"Much of the political world was focused late yesterday on the New Hampshire presidential primaries, and for good reason: the nations future direction will be shaped in large part by who wins the White House.

But away from the Granite State, Americans received a very different kind of reminder about whats actually at stake in 2016. NBC News Pete Williams reported :

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked enforcement of the Obama administrations ambitious new plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The justices granted a plea from 30 states that asked for a temporary hold on the new Clean Energy Plan while the lower courts decide whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to impose it.

This was ... wait for it ... a 5-4 decision. The courts Republican-appointed conservatives  Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts  agreed to block the energy policy, while the courts Democratic-appointed center-left justices  Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissented.

A New York Times report noted that there is no precedent for the high court taking a step like this: the Supreme Court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court. Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former environmental legal counsel to the Obama administration, described the move as stunning.

To appreciate why, l ets pause for a moment to consider how we reached this point.

As regular readers may recall , in June 2014, President Obama unveiled an ambitious plan to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants, setting reduced emissions limits. Under the plan, the White House offered states some flexibility in how they reach the target: the Obama administration was less concerned with how states cut carbon pollution and more concerned with the end goal. How states got there was up to them.

A total of 27 states balked, saying they not only want to ignore the crisis, but they also believed the Obama administration lacked the authority to impose these requirements. The White House pointed to the Clean Air Act, approved by Congress, to insist the authority most certainly exists.

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  generally considered the nations second highest court  has agreed to hear the case, but it left the policy in place as the legal proceedings continued. Yesterday, five Supreme Court justices intervened  for the first time in American history  to block the implementation of the policy before the appeals court even hears arguments in the case.

Voxs Brad Plumer added , This isnt a fatal blow for Obamas climate rule, but its not a great sign. It suggests that five justices on the Supreme Court have some serious doubts about the Clean Power Plan.

In the meantime, the courts conservative majority offered a powerful and timely reminder to voters about whats on the line in the 2016 election. Readers are going to get tired of seeing me write this , but three current justices will be at least 80 by Inauguration Day 2017. Ginsburg will be 83. A fourth, Breyer, will be 78.

msnbc,2016-02-22 13:42:00,"Rubio knocks Cruz for 'dishonest' tactics, but avoids Trump",['Alexandra Jaffe'],"LAS VEGAS  Marco Rubio is keeping up the heat on Ted Cruz, suggesting he should fire someone for what he called a pattern of deceptive and untrue tactics and comments coming from Cruzs campaign.

But at the same time, hes continuing to avoid attacking the GOP front-runner, Donald Trump, even as he claims the fight for the nomination has narrowed to a three-man race.

Speaking to reporters before departing on his charter for a three-stop tour of Nevada on Monday, Rubio said with Cruzs campaign, were now at a point where we start asking about accountability. You talk about the VA, where people who arent doing their job need to be fired well, whos going to be fired when Ted Cruz is president? Because this campaign now has repeatedly done things that they have to apologize for and no ones ever held accountable.

His comments came in response to a video circulated by Cruz backers over the weekend that claimed  erroneously  to show Rubio telling Cruzs father, Rafael, and one of his staffers that there arent many answers in the Bible. The chance encounter between Rubio and the Cruz contingency was caught on-film and someone incorrectly transcribed the interaction in on-screen text, and Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler posted it on his Facebook page.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubio told reporters that he had actually told the Cruz staffer that the answer to every question youll ever have is in that book - and then I pointed to the Book of Proverbs, which he was reading, I said, particularly that one, which is the book of wisdom.

And then for them to take a video and to transcribe words on it that are the complete opposite of what I said  its incredibly disturbing, he said.

The Cruz campaign ultimately chalked the video up to a misunderstanding, and Tyler apologized for it. Rubio said he accepted the apology but ticked off the recent controversies dogging Cruz over his campaign tactics  his staffers telling Iowa voters Ben Carson had dropped out; controversial robocalls allegedly coming from the senators campaign in South Carolina and an ad attacking Rubio on cap and trade that South Carolina networks eventually took off-air because it misstated the facts  and said the latest video was part of a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns or flat-out just lying.

Its a continuation of an attack Rubio first launched in Iowa, where he accused Cruz of saying or doing anything to get elected, and ramped up in South Carolina after Cruz and Rubio each exchanged charges the other was lying at the last GOP debate.

Rubios campaign kept up the scrutiny on Cruz through the weekend, issuing a call last Friday for their supporters to keep an eye out for dirty tricks from the Cruz campaign. And it wasnt just Rubio accusing Cruz of dishonesty  Donald Trump took up the charge as well, amplifying the message and contributing to a drop in Cruzs popularity over the past week that ultimately helped Rubio gain a slight edge over him in the South Carolina primary.

Rubios second-place finish spurred Jeb Bush to drop out of the race, helping to consolidate the GOP primary into a largely three-man battle between Rubio, Cruz and Trump. But where Rubio hasnt shied away from attacking Cruz, hes been reluctant to take aim at Trump, avoiding every opportunity to criticize the front-runner  to the chagrin of some in the GOP.

On Monday, he again toed that cautious line. Asked if he agreed with a new ad from a super PAC supporting his bid that called Trump erratic, unreliable, Rubio said he hadnt seen the ad and declined to comment on its substance. And while he raised doubts about his foreign policy understanding, Rubio still gave Trump the benefit of the doubt on that issue.

I have said that when it comes to issues of national security, Donald has yet to prove that he has an in-depth understanding or the judgment to make good decisions about that  that could change, he said.

msnbc,2016-02-21 17:44:00,129 killed in Syrian bombings  as Kerry announces 'provisional' truce,"['Abigail Williams', 'Alex Johnson']","A bloody spasm of violence was reported to have killed almost 130 people Sunday in Syria as the United States announced that it and Russia had reached a provisional agreement on a cease-fire in the civil war-torn country.

The official Syrian news agency SANA said 83 people were killed and 178 others were wounded in three bombings near a Shiite shrine in Damascus.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 46 people were killed by two suicide bombers in the al-Zahraa neighborhood of Homs. At least 28 of the victims in Homs were civilians, said the observatory, a British-based human rights watchdog that is widely considered to be authoritative.

SANA said ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombings near Damascus, which it described as a car bomb explosion followed by two suicide bombs in the area of the Shiite shrine of Sayyida Zeinab. It said most of the injured were women and children.

The violence came on the same day that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington and Moscow had negotiated a provisional deal on a truce in Syrias civil war.

RELATED: Syrias Assad: Ready for truce if terrorists dont exploit it

World powers, which have been pushing for a halt in Syrias nearly five-year civil war, had hoped to see a truce take effect on Friday but have struggled to agree on the terms.

Kerry said in remarks in Amman with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh that he had spoken with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov three times to secure a cessation of hostilities that could begin in the coming days.

Kerry provided no details, and he acknowledged that a way to enforce the agreement still hadnt been determined.

U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Putin also have yet to sign off on the terms, but Kerry said he expects the two leaders to speak somewhere in the next days or so in order to try to complete this task.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Saturday that he was definitely ready to accept a cessation of hostility  but only if terrorists werent allowed to use it to their advantage.

We announced that were ready, Assad told the Spanish newspaper El Pais.

If you want to say cease-fire, its not the correct word, because a cease-fire is between two armies or two countries, Assad said. Its better to say cessation of hostility, or lets say, stopping the operations. ...

Its also about other complimentary and more important factors  preventing the terrorists from using the cease-fire or the cessation of hostility to improve their position, he said. Its about preventing other countries, especially Turkey, from sending more recruits, more terrorists, more armaments or any kind of logistical support to those terrorists.

Turkey has been among the most active of the Western countries supporting insurgents fighting Assads regime.

msnbc,2016-02-22 08:09:00,FBI fires back at Apple: 'We don't want to break anyone's encryption',"['Alex Johnson', 'Andrew Blankstein']","The war of words between Apple Inc. and the government continued Sunday as FBI Director James Comey said forcing Apple to help unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is no big deal.

We dont want to break anyones encryption or set a master key loose on the land, Comey said in a statement Sunday night, insisting that vital decisions involving safety from terrorists shouldnt be left in the hands of corporations that sell stuff for a living.

A federal judge last week ordered Apple to help investigators gain access to encrypted data on the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, on Dec. 2.

Not even Apple can decrypt the encrypted iPhone, according to the company. What investigators want it to do is help them figure out Farooks password so they can simply unlock the phone  but they fear that it has a common feature that wipes the data completely after a certain number of failed password entries.

Apple said it wouldnt comply, arguing that helping the government unlock an encrypted phone would sabotage the entire point of encryption and endanger the privacy of millions of its customers.

Since then, the company and federal authorities have lobbed strongly worded statements at each other. Heres how the battle has played out:

WEDNESDAY : Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook says the order would force the company to build a backdoor to the iPhone and that no reasonable person would find that acceptable.

: Prosecutors file a motion seeking to force Apples compliance, writing in court documents that Apple shouldnt be allowed to design and market its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data found by a court to be important to an critical investigation. SATURDAY: The FBI lays out in a statement more detail on why it needs Apples help. It says that investigators were able to gain access to data Farook backed up to his iCloud account  but that Farook stopped backing up his phone in October, well before the December shootings. Since the iCloud backup does not contain everything on an iPhone, they said, investigators objective was, and still is, to extract as much evidence as possible from the phone.

SUNDAY: Comey tries to downplay the dispute, arguing in his new statement that no precedent would be set if Apple would just go along.

I hope folks will take a deep breath and stop saying the world is ending, but instead use that breath to talk to each other, he said.

Although this case is about the innocents attacked in San Bernardino, it does highlight that we have awesome new technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure  privacy and safety, he said, adding:

We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorists passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly.

msnbc,2016-02-21 12:09:00,Cyclone Winston: Six dead after record-breaking storm hits Fiji,['Associated Press'],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand  Most of Fiji was without electricity Sunday and residents were told to stay inside for a second straight night as officials scrambled to restore services and assess damage in the wake of a ferocious cyclone that left at least six people dead and destroyed homes.

Winds from Cyclone Winston, which tore through the Pacific Island chain over the weekend, reached 180 miles per hour, making it the strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere since record-keeping began, according to Weather.com.

Although the weather calmed Sunday, a curfew was extended through early Monday and police were empowered to make arrests without a warrant to ensure order.

In a televised address to the nation Sunday, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said many people had been left without power, fresh water or communications.

The damage has been widespread, homes have been destroyed, many low-lying areas have flooded, and many people have been left stunned and confused about what to do, he said.

He said that the police and military had been brought in to help with rescue operations and the general cleanup, and that government agencies were working overtime to clear roads and restore power.

This is a time of sorrow, but it will also be a time of action, Bainimarama said. We will stand united in the face of this disaster.

Officials were trying to establish communications and road access to the hardest-hit areas, and said they would not know the full extent of the damage and injuries until then.

George Dregaso of Fijis National Disaster Management Office said that two people on Ovalau Island died when the house they were sheltering in collapsed on them, and that another man was killed on Koro Island, although it wasnt clear how.

Authorities also said three people on the main island of Viti Levu were killed in the storm, but didnt have more details.

Tourism Minister Faiyaz Siddiq Koya said that all tourists in Fiji were safe and that there was no significant damage to the majority of hotels on the main island. Fiji is a popular tourist destination, known for its beach resorts and scuba diving.

Cyclone Winston hit Fiji on Saturday and moved westward overnight along the northern coast of Viti Levu. Fijis capital, Suva, located in the southern part of the main island, was not directly in the cyclones path and avoided the worst of its destructive power.

Truth be told, weve gotten off pretty lightly here in the capital, said Alice Clements, a spokeswoman for UNICEF. It was still a pretty awful night. You could hear crashing trees and power lines, and popping rivets as roofs got lifted and ripped out.

She said there was foliage everywhere that looked like it had been put through a blender.

About 80 percent of the nations 900,000 people were without regular power, although about one-third of them were able to get some electricity from generators, said Dregaso, the disaster office official. Landlines throughout Fiji were down, but most mobile networks were working.

Dregaso said there were 483 people who had evacuated from their homes and were staying in 32 emergency shelters. He said he expected the number of evacuees to rise.

Authorities were urging people to remain indoors as they cleared fallen trees and power lines. They said that all schools would be closed for a week to allow time for the cleanup, and that three universities would be closed until further notice.

The government declared a 30-day state of natural disaster, giving extra powers to police to arrest people without a warrant.

The government said the curfew would end at 5:30 a.m. Monday.

The curfew has been imposed to protect lives and protect property, Prime Minister Bainimarama said in his address.

Clements, the UNICEF spokeswoman, said there was particular concern for people on the northern part of the main island and on smaller islands. She said that many would have lost their homes and livelihoods, and that some tourist resorts on the outer islands may have been damaged.

The airport reopened Sunday to allow emergency flights, Dregaso said, after many flights had been canceled the day before.

msnbc,2016-02-22 12:56:00,"In the race to be Trump's sole rival, Cruz's cash matters",[],"In the wake of Donald Trumps double-digit victory in the South Carolina primary, John Kasich told supporters, Tonight it became a four-person race. Around the same time, Marco Rubio declared, After tonight, this has become a three-person race. And then theres, Ted Cruz, who argued shortly before the primary that the Republican contest is a two-man race.

How clarifying.

With Donald Trump having already cruised in New Hampshire and South Carolina, its difficult to see him as anything but the current frontrunner. The question is wholl be his principal rival as the field narrows and the race enters the next phase.

Rubio, pointing to the Republican establishments gushing affections, believes hes the one for the job. Cruz, meanwhile, points to his actual performances in the early nominating contests  he won Iowa, defeated Rubio in New Hampshire, and is one of only two candidates to finish in the top three in each of the contests thus far  while making the case for himself.

This is bound to go on for a while, but dont overlook the significance of campaign financing. The New York Times has a good piece on this today.

A seven-month, $220 million surge of spending on behalf of mainstream Republican candidates has yielded a primary battle dominated by Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, two candidates reviled by most of the partys leading donors. Now, as they approach a pivotal and expensive stage of the campaign, the two insurgent candidates  who have won the first three contests  appear to be in the best position financially to compete in the 11 states that will vote on Super Tuesday, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday.

For all the Rubio hype, Cruz raised $7.6 million in January  the best showing of any Republican candidate, and nearly $3 million more than the Florida senator  and the Texan began the month with $13.6 million in cash on hand, which is also the strongest showing in the GOP field.

As Rachel noted on the show a couple of weeks ago, this is what separates Cruz from previous Republican candidates  including Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee  whove relied on evangelicals and social conservatives as a base. The Texas senator won Iowa, but he has what his like-minded predecessors did not: money.

Some caveats are probably in order. For one thing, this refers to reported campaign fundraising, but it doesnt include affiliated entities like super PACs (though Cruz is faring pretty well on that front, too). For another, we dont yet have a look at February fundraising, and its a safe bet as the Republican establishment has embraced Rubio with great enthusiasm, his coffers have swelled.

Plus, as Jeb Bush can attest, money isnt everything.

But the nature of the race is about to change. Retail politicking is key in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, where voters expect to shake your hand, look you in the eye, and kick the proverbial tires a bit, but on March 1, Republican voters will participate in 10 primaries and 1 caucus. To do well, candidates will rely less on meet-and-greet events at coffee shops, and more on advertising, field operations, and an effective campaign infrastructure.","['million', 'won', 'campaign', 'rival', 'sole', 'cash', 'rubio', 'matters', 'cruz', 'race', 'cruzs', 'trumps', 'senator', 'candidates', 'republican', 'south']"
msnbc,2016-02-22 13:43:00,Trump needs his 'own damn bucket' to waterboard: Ex-CIA chief,['Ken Dilanian'],"If Donald Trump is serious about wanting to waterboard terrorists, hed better bring his own bucket, former CIA director Michael Hayden says, because the CIA isnt going down that road again.

Haydens pithy line, which he first uttered in a Showtime documentary and repeated to NBC News, underscores a serious issue: The GOP front-runner has vowed to bring back torture if he becomes president, but current and former CIA officials say the agency feels so burned by what happened when its post 9/11 interrogation program was exposed that it would refuse any such orders.

Multiple investigations, grand juries, presidential condemnations and congressional star chambers have a way of doing that to you, Hayden, who was CIA director at the end of the George W. Bush administration, told NBC News.

He then offered an even stronger version of his Showtime quote. Like the man said, if you want somebody waterboarded, bring your own damn bucket.

Trump said Wednesday he is convinced that torture works, so he would bring back waterboarding and much stronger methods. Other Republican candidates havent been as explicit, but some have called for bringing back the harsh interrogations that were repudiated by President Obama when he took office.

RELATED: Trump hails torture, mass killings with pigs blood ammo in SC

But current and former CIA officials, including some who played key roles in the post-9/11 terrorist detention program, say the fallout from that controversial episode has left the spy agency unwilling ever again to conduct coercive interrogations. That would be true, they say, even if the country was attacked again and Congress undid the law it passed last year banning harsh techniques.

I cant imagine anyone volunteering to do it, said Bill Harlow, a former CIA spokesman who coordinated a response to the Senate report and has co-authored the memoirs of several former senior CIA officials.

At issue is whether the U.S. could reprise the brutal interrogations the CIA carried out on al Qaeda operatives after the 9/11 attacks, including the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, which was used on 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two others. Other coercive techniques included sleep deprivation, slapping, humiliation, nudity, fear and isolation, often used in combination.

There is stark disagreement over whether the techniques worked, but polls show public majorities believe they did.

The CIA personnel who supervised and carried out so-called enhanced interrogations on 39 prisoners at secret sites abroad after the September 11 terror attacks were subject to lengthy criminal investigations that required them to hire personal lawyers. Their internal correspondence was laid bare in a Senate report that accused the CIA of repeatedly lying about the nature and effectiveness of the techniques. Some CIA personnel were publicly pilloried.

All that happened even though the interrogation program was ordered by President Bush and sanctioned by Justice Department lawyers.

The legal opinions in question were later repudiated as flawed, and some experts believe the harsher techniques were never lawful. The Senate report concluded that the techniques were more brutal than the CIA let on, and that they didnt produce unique and life-saving intelligence. FBI officials  who refused to participate  also concluded the techniques didnt work. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.-California), the architect of the report, called the CIA program a stain on our values.

The CIA officers involved vehemently disagree  and they feel betrayed.

RELATED: The GOPs pro-torture posture comes into sharper focus

Hundreds of them still work at the CIA, noted John Rizzo, a former top agency lawyer who helped negotiate the interrogation program with the White House and Justice Department.

They feel, he said, that they did what was asked of them to stop terrorism, and after the political winds changed, they were vilified as `torturers and `war criminals  just for doing their thankless and dangerous jobs to keep the country safe.

And now, under a Trump administration, said Rizzo, many of these same CIA career officers would be ordered to go down  perhaps double down  on that perilous path again? Who could blame for them for refusing to expose themselves and their families to a reprise someday of the ordeal they have had to endure? I hope and trust no CIA director  or its lawyer  would countenance such an order.

President Obama banned the techniques when he took office, and Congress last year enshrined that ban into law.

The CIA no longer conducts its own interrogations, and a relatively small number of terrorism suspects have been captured alive during the Obama administration. Some intelligence officials find irony in the fact that many thousands have been killed by drone missiles or bombs.

But though many CIA officers believe it makes sense to capture and grill terrorists beyond the strictures of the U.S. Army field manual, which is the current standard  they want no part in doing so.

They didnt expect people in their own government to turn on them, and they didnt expect people in Congress to develop amnesia about what they were briefed on, Harlow said.

Some lawmakers have said they were misled about the techniques when briefed in secret, something CIA officials dispute.

When the Obama administration made public the once-secret legal memos authorizing the techniques in 2009, Hayden, whose memoir, Playing to the Edge, is to be published next week, described it as a breach of faith that would, over the long term, cause CIA officers not to take certain actions.

On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly spoken about how he would treat terror suspects. He has also called for killing the family members of terrorists, which experts say would be a war crime.

Trump wants to bring back including waterboarding and much stronger interrogation methods he hasnt named.

The U.S. should respond to ISISs grisly brutality in kind, he says.

RELATED: Donald Trump: Torture works

Believe me, it works, Trump said. And waterboarding is your minor form. Some people say its not actually torture. Lets assume it is. But they asked me the question: What do you think of waterboarding? Absolutely fine. But we should go much stronger than waterboarding. Thats the way I feel. Theyre chopping off heads. Believe me, we should go much stronger, because our countrys in trouble. Were in danger. We have people that want to do really bad things!

His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reluctance of intelligence officials to reboot enhanced interrogation.

No other candidate has gone as far as Trump, but some Republicans have declined to rule out bringing back harsh techniques. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has said he would capture terrorists, bring them the prison at Guantanamo, and find out everything they know, though he hasnt said how.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who first appeared to take a stand against brutal interrogations, later said waterboarding isnt torture, and he declined to rule out using harsh techniques.

Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel for Human Rights Watch, says its worrisome that major GOP candidates are calling for resuming torture. This wouldnt be happening had the Justice Department prosecuted some of the perpetrators instead of declining to file charges, she said. Shes not confident the law on the books would prevent a future president from ordering torture in some form.

Weve seen in the past that certain administrations have tried to figure out creative ways to get around those rules, said Pitter, and its possible that another administration will do so again.

One wrinkle is that many Americans appear to be closer to Trump than to Obama and Pitter on the matter.

Polls show that a majority of Americans think the treatment of terror suspects by the CIA was justified, even if the word torture is used to describe that treatment.

If there ever was another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, many Americans might demand that terror suspects be captured and made to talk.

But who would make them? Not the CIA, Hayden and other current and former officers say.

Cheat me once, shame on you, Hayden said. Cheat me twice....

msnbc,2016-02-19 13:45:00,Is Philadelphia testing its drinking water correctly?,['Lisa Riordan Seville'],"Philadelphias water passed its last round of lead testing with flying colors, but documents obtained by NBC News show those results may offer a misleading picture of the lead flowing from Philly taps.

A memo obtained by NBC News through a records request shows that in 2014 in a city with up to 50,000 homes with lead pipes, Philadelphia based its clean bill of health on sampling just 34 homes with lead pipes  fewer than required by law  while instead testing far more homes without lead pipes. After inquiries from NBC News, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said it is now reviewing Philadelphias data.

Experts say the choice of houses, coupled with other flaws in the citys testing methods, may be offering Phillys residents false comfort about the quality of their water - and are a symptom of nationwide testing failures that may have masked lead problems in cities across the country, including Flint. Compared to some other U.S. utilities, Philadelphia Water has a reputation for being well-run and resourced.

I have the utmost respect for the folks in Philadelphia, and if this is whats going on in Philadelphia I shudder to think whats going on in the rest of the country, said Dr. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech researcher who was key to exposing the Flint lead crisis.

Close video Flint mayor ready to replace pipes as state, governor delay Mayor Karen Weaver of Flint, Michigan talks with Rachel Maddow about how she intends to commence with replacing the citys water pipes as early as next week as Governor Rick Snyder and the state legislature continues to drag their feet on funding and... embed like save share group

State and local officials are struggling to follow a federal regulation known as the Lead and Copper Rule thats designed to gauge whether a utility is properly treating its water to prevent corrosion of pipes that would leach heavy metals like lead into the water.

If 90 percent of homes tested register below the action level of 15 parts per billion of lead, the system is considered compliant. But testers are supposed to focus on high-risk homes, meaning older structures that have lead pipes or lead service lines in order to get a worst-case picture of the system.

Despite assurances by Flint and Sebring, Ohio, utilities that they were testing high-risk homes, neither was. Now officials in both towns are scrambling to address lead issues overlooked for months or years.

In a city like Philadelphia, which has old housing stock and thousands of lead pipes, the rule requires at least half the homes tested be high risk.

But documents obtained by NBC News show that Philadelphia Water was missing many high-risk homes, and getting test results from neighborhoods with relatively new, and therefore lower risk, homes. The percentage of high-risk homes tested had also dropped over time. The results show that the homes picked may determine whether the city seems to have safe water or seems to have a problem.

In 2002, 54 of the homes tested in Philadelphia were highest-risk Tier 1 homes, meaning they had lead pipes or copper pipes with lead solder laid just before the lead solder ban in 1986. In 2002, the city only tested a total of 63 homes, and only nine were low-risk.

Philadelphias all-important 90th percentile  the result that triggers its overall grade  came in at 13 parts per billion, just two points under the action level that requires utilities warn customers of the risk. Five lead-line houses that year tested high, as did one low-risk copper-line home.

By the following round of testing, three years later, most of the high-lead homes had dropped out of the testing pool. Since then, as the number of high-risk homes in the test group dwindled while the overall pool of tested homes grew, the citys results improved.

In 2014, Philadelphia tested just 34 homes with lead lines, and eight with high-risk lead solder. Those 42 high-risk homes made up less than a third of the 134 homes tested. That year, the citys 90th percentile had 5 ppb of lead in its water, well under the 15 ppb action level. Eight results tested high that year  three lead-line homes, and five lower-risk copper pipe homes.

The trend of choosing low-risk homes is combined with sampling instructions for test homes, first revealed in documents obtained by the Guardian, that may also skew the results downward.

Residents are told to remove their tap aerator and run their water the night before the test to flush out the line, known as pre-flushing, a practice that EPA water experts say can produce misleading results and has been used in other cities, like Flint.

RELATED: Parents of tragic 2-year-old with lead poisoning sue Flint

This clears particulate lead out of the plumbing and biases the results low, wrote EPA scientist Miguel Del Toral in a February 2015 email about Flints testing obtained by researchers at Virginia Tech. This practice provides false reassurance about the true lead levels in the water, he added.

Asked if Philadelphias method of choosing homes and pre-flushing could skew results, EPA water expert Mike Schock said, In my technical opinion, yes it would.

Philadelphia counters that its testing methods paint an accurate picture of a city where high lead is an anomaly, not the rule.

Its not clear that the way were taking samples is hiding problems, said Gary Burlingame, director of Philadelphia Waters Bureau of Laboratory Services. Could we be missing homes out there that have higher lead levels than others? Of course.

Utilities across the U.S. have told regulators about the challenges of meeting the federal rules demands. Cities must solicit volunteers for their water studies, and then ask the volunteers to run the tests themselves. In its memo to regulators, Philadelphia Water said it sent over 8,000 letters to customers, and only 134 had followed through the process.

People arent responding, said Burlingame, and often dont continue testing from one year to the next. Lead in water just hasnt been something thats been a national issue.

The state Department of Environmental Protection accepted Philadelphias results, and the citys argument that it was not able to get more high-risk homes. This despite the state agencys own guidance that, in accord with the federal rule that at least half of the homes tested in cities like Philly, with old homes and lots of lead pipes, should be high-risk.

RELATED: Hillary Clinton: There are too many Flints

The state also has guidance that any homes tested beyond the required number be high risk so as not to dilute the testing pool. Philadelphia was only required to test 50 homes in total, but tested 134  most of them low-risk. Burlingame said the utility tested the extra homes because it believed a larger pool would give a more accurate picture of the system.

He added that flushing the line was to clear any hot water from the tap. The federal rule is designed to test cold water, he said.

The DEP said that while half of homes tested should be high risk, sometimes a utility is not able to find enough high-risk homes. However, the agency said it is now reviewing the data submitted by Philadelphia.

The agency also said that Philadelphia had not diluted its pool in 2014, despite the extra homes in the sample, because more low-risk homes had tested high than high-risk homes.

The tier 3 [low risk] sample actually skewed the overall sample level higher, while still registering below action levels, the DEP said in a statement. Burlingame also said the city has seen problems in lower-risk homes in the past.

In addition, both the DEP and the EPA have issued explicit guidance telling utilities not to remove aerators when testing. But the DEP said it cant make utilities comply.

Both state and federal guidelines do recommend that aerators not be removed, said a DEP spokesperson. However, states cannot enforce recommendations or guidance.

Flaws in testing have not stopped officials across the country from trying to calm the fears of residents in the wake of Flint. Earlier this month, based on testing results from Philadelphia and more than 150 other state water utilities that came in under the action level, the state DEP told Pennsylvanians that drinking water is not the source of elevated lead levels found in some of the states children.

DEP Secretary John Quigley sent a clear message to the people of the state: DEP has regulations and programs in place to monitor lead levels in drinking water, and they are working.

msnbc,2016-02-22 09:45:00,First Read: It's a three-man Republican race,[],"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matter.

Its a three-man Republican race view photo essay Photos: South Carolina's Republican presidential primary Republican presidential candidates have been campaigning across the Palmetto State in anticipation of its first-in-the-South GOP primary.

After three Republican nominating races in the books, we have a three-man contest  among Donald Trump (the winner of New Hampshire and South Carolina), Ted Cruz (the winner of Iowa), and Marco Rubio (the narrow second-place finisher in South Carolina). The exit poll from Saturdays South Carolina primary underscores this three-man race: Trump overwhelmingly won among Republicans who want a candidate who can bring needed change and who tells it like it is; Cruz won among Republicans who want a candidate who shares my values; and Rubio won among those who want someone who can win in November. So thats your GOP race  Mr. Change, Mr. Values, and Mr. Electability. And all three of them have challenges heading into Super Tuesday. Can Trump continue to win as the GOP field gets smaller? (How he performs in Cruzs Texas will be instructive.) Can Cruz broaden his appeal with Republican moderates? (He got just 7% from moderates, according to the South Carolina exit poll, and finishing third in South Carolina is a troubling sign for his longer-term growth.) And can Rubio finally win a race? (Hes the only one of the three without a gold medal.)

But Trump is your big favorite

Yet if its a three-man race, Donald Trump is your heavy favorite. Think about it: If anyone else had won New Hampshire and South Carolina in back-to-back contests  like John McCain did in 2008  youd say the race is over. Well, this race isnt over, but Trump is playing with house money. If he wins in Texas on March 1, or wins in Florida on March 15, its done. And the way he won South Carolina, grabbing all of the states 50 delegates by winning just 33% of the overall vote, demonstrates how he can build a significant delegate lead come March 1.

The establishment rallying around Rubio begins

With Trump now the clear Republican frontrunner, GOP establishment types are already rallying around Rubio. NBCs Leigh Ann Caldwell: Bobbie Kilberg and her husband Bill, bundlers who first backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and then signed on to Bushs campaign in the waning days, have decided to back Rubio. He is now the candidate around whom mainstream Republicans can coalesce, Kilberg told NBC News. But Rubio encounters two significant hurdles in a race against Trump  immigration (where its impossible for him to get to Trumps right on the issue) and special-interest money (with Trump eager to tell audiences how Rubio will owe his big contributors).

Kasich and Carson are still playing a role by staying alive

With the GOP contest now a three-man race, that doesnt mean you should ignore the other two Republicans still running  John Kasich and Ben Carson. If Kasich is able to have enough money to survive two or three more weeks of campaigning, he could be a player in Michigan (March 8) and his home state of Ohio (March 15), which would hurt Rubio in those two states. And even though he finished sixth in South Carolina, Carson still captured 7% of the vote, which could potentially be going to someone else (Cruz? Trump?).

I feel like the Republican Party as I know it suspended its campaign

After his disappointing fourth-place finish in South Carolina, Jeb Bush suspended his campaign. And more than anything else, it emphasized how todays Republican Party is no longer the party that Bushs brother once led or that featured Bush as one of the countrys most conservative governors in the early 2000s. MSNBCs Benjy Sarlin: This was a candidate who stood for an entire generation of Republican Party building, who was the figurative and literal heir to the family brand that had graced nearly every GOP ticket for a generation. And he ceded the race to a candidate whose campaign was a walking insult to his family legacy and everything Bushs supporters told themselves the party stood for. I feel like the Republican Party as I know it suspended its campaign tonight, said Lee Spieckerman, a Texas commentator who had knocked on doors for Bush in New Hampshire and in South Carolina.

You say you want a revolution?

Hillary Clintons victory in Nevada on Saturday was a big sigh of relief for her campaign, and it now gives her the ability to start pulling away in the delegate race  with the contests in South Carolina and the March 1 states (like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia Tennessee, Virginia) coming up. Beyond keeping up in those contests, Bernie Sanders now faces this challenge: How does he convince Democratic voters that he truly is inspiring a revolution. Just look at these turnout numbers in the first three states:

Iowa 2008: 239,972

Iowa 2016: 171,109

New Hampshire 2008: 288,672

New Hampshire 2016: 250,983

Nevada 2008: 120,000

Nevada 2016: 80,000

As Sanders said on Meet the Press yesterday, The voter turnout was not as high as I had wanted. And what Ive said over and over again, we will do well when young people, when working-class people come out. We do not do well when the voter turnout is not large. But what happens when that turnout isnt as high as 1) whats happening in the GOP race, and 2) what happened in the Dem race in 2008? Thats an important question for Sanders and his supporters to answer. If youre promising a revolution, dont people have to come out  more than in 2008, more than what were seeing on the GOP side  for that revolution to be successful?

Feeling the burn rate: Sanders also has a structural challenge

Hes raising a lot of money ($21 million in January), but hes also spending like a general-election nominee ($35 million). That amounts to a 164% burn rate, and its why his cash on hand is less than half of the size as Hillary Clintons. Here are the Jan. 2016 fundraising numbers:

msnbc,2016-02-21 14:15:00,RNC chair on brokered convention: 'We're prepared for anything',[],"Donald Trumps first-place finish in South Carolina has revived an ongoing discussion about the possibility of a brokered Republican convention, the prospect of which became a central question as the candidates made the rounds of the post-primary Sunday shows.

The business mogul toppled his rivals in the Palmetto State with 33 percent of the vote. Sen. Marco Rubio, his nearest competitor, came in 10 percentage points behind him and barely overtook Sen. Ted Cruz for second place. Trumps victories in South Carolina and New Hampshire, as well as his second-place finish in Iowa, give him a decisive lead in the delegate count and establish him as the clear front-runner going into the February 23 Nevada caucus  a scenario that has sent some Republicans into a panic.

When asked by Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union if party leaders do not take Trump seriously despite his strong showings, Trump pointed to his status as an outsider.

All of the establishment sort of said, Well, wait a minute. What happened to him? Hes not supposed to be doing that. Thats not in the cards, Trump said of his presidential bid. I dont want money. You know, Im self-funding my campaign, so I dont need donor money and lobbyist money and special interest money. And that bothers them because the special interests want to control their candidates, and I cant be controlled.

RELATED: Jeb Bush leaves behind a party he can barely recognize

Some on the right have argued that if the GOP field does not consolidate behind one or two alternative candidates in the coming weeks, the chances of Trump winning the nomination or the GOP having a brokered convention would increase dramatically. However, Trump dismissed the notion of a brokered convention, which would occur if no candidate has the required amount of delegates to secure the nomination. The Republicans would then take the battle to the convention floor to decide on a nominee in July.

I dont think were going to have a convention, a brokered convention. I think its unlikely. I think Im doing better than that. And so far, you know, Im really on my way, Trump told Tapper. I thought I actually won Iowa if you look at it really closely. But even if I didnt, I just got one delegate less because I came in a very, very close second. So I have a second and I have two firsts. And New Hampshire was a blowout, and this one was a blowout.

Despite telling reporters earlier this month that his campaign was planning for a race that could go to the convention floor, Marco Rubio on Sunday also dismissed talk of a brokered convention while decrying party insiders.

I dont think its likely. I think the voters are going to decide it. I most certainly dont want party insiders deciding this, because if party insiders had been the ones deciding this nomination, I wouldnt be standing. I wouldnt be here right now doing this interview with you, Rubio said in an interview with Tapper. I wouldnt have even been in the Senate, for that matter. They didnt want me in the Senate.

On ABCs This Week, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus denied that Trumps rise was an indictment of the party leadership. Priebus also insisted that the RNC would support whomever the eventual nominee is, even as Trump continues to claim that the committee is treating him unfairly.

I think its early in the process, but certainly when the time comes and when were sitting either before Cleveland or at Cleveland or whenever that point may come, and we have a presumptive nominee, what will happen is the RNC will join in with that nominee, and we will put together the biggest, which weve already started doing, the biggest ground game and data operation that weve ever seen, Priebus said.

When asked if the RNC was planning for a brokered convention, Priebus said he doubted that one would occur but that the party leadership would be ready if necessary.

Planning can mean a lot of things. Were prepared for anything. I was general counsel for two years before I was chairman of this party, Ive been chairman for six years. I dont think there are too many people that are more familiar with the procedures of nominating someone at a convention than I am, Priebus told George Stephanopoulos. So Im prepared, and we will be prepared if that happens, but again, I dont think thats going to be the case. If it did, then of course, obviously, it would be pretty historic. But well be ready.","['brokered', 'trump', 'nominee', 'rnc', 'money', 'priebus', 'prepared', 'im', 'convention', 'party', 'chair', 'think', 'dont']"
msnbc,2016-02-19 09:12:00,US fighter jets target ISIS in Libya's Sabratha; dozens killed,"['Alastair Jamieson', 'Jim Miklaszewski']","U.S. fighter jets launched airstrikes against an ISIS compound in Libya overnight as they targeted a terrorist linked to tourist massacres in Tunisian, American military officials said.

Dozens of people were killed in the bombing raid on the coastal city of Sabratha, local officials and activists said. Warplanes struck a house 6 miles outside the city center, Sabrathas municipal administration said.

A senior U.S. official told NBC News the airstrike likely killed Tunisian ISIS operative Noureddine Chouchane.

The 36-year-old jihadist was directly linked to the two 2015 attacks in Tunisia - on a resort hotel in Sousse and the Bardo Museum in Tunis, officials said.

Sabratha is close to the Tunisian border and one of the areas where Western officials say ISIS militants had some presence as part of their expansion in the North African state.

Citing hospital figures, the city council said 41 people were killed and 6 wounded in the airstrike, which took place at 3:30 a.m. Friday (8:30 p.m. Thursday ET).

It said the bombed building was being used by Tunisians, including ISIS militants and that machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were found under the rubble.

The raid came after President Barack Obama warned that Washington was prepared to strike inside Libya. We will continue to take actions where there is a clear target in mind, he said Tuesday.

The strike was carried out by 2 US F-15s from Lakenheath in England. Defense officials told NBC News the strike would not be the last in Libya, but stressed it did not mark the beginning of a larger, sustained campaign against ISIS there.

There was no information that an attack was imminent but the fighters at the compound were getting ready to do something, one defense official said.

The dead were mostly Tunisians according to the Sabratha Media Center, which describes itself as an NGO founded by a group of local journalists.

To those asking if they were ISIS or not, we ask for them to wait and be patient, because foreigners lived in the [targeted] house, mostly Tunisians. Tomorrow we will know in details, it said a post on social media.

Since strongman Mohammad Gaddafi was overthrown five years ago by rebel forces backed by a campaign of NATO air strikes, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos with two rival governments each backed by competing factions of former rebel brigades.

Sabratha, which had a population of about 100,000 at the time of Libyas 2004 census, lies on the Mediterranean coast about 40 miles west of Tripoli. It is home to a UNESCO-protected archaeological site of Roman ruins.

Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier this month that Libya was emerging as a particular concern in the fight against ISIS. He said the failing state was a breeding ground for jihadists who could take over abandoned oil fields.

The last thing in the world you want is a false caliphate with access to billions of dollars of oil revenue, Kerry said.

Tunisia, which shares nearly 400 miles of border with Libya, has been worried for weeks about what they understood to be an imminent strike by the U.S.-led coalition targeting ISIS.

It recently built nearly a wall of sand and trenches to fortify its border amid concern about militants, arms traffickers and refugees entering its territory.

Patrick Porter, professor of strategic studies at the University of Exeter, told a committee of British lawmakers earlier this month that ISIS was seeking opportunities in Libya, exploiting that countrys chaos as it came under pressure from U.S.-led and Russian airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.

ISIS is looking for somewhere to re-establish itself, he said. It is a sign of a movement that is looking opportunistically for other chances, because it is finding it much more difficult than even a year ago.

msnbc,2016-02-13 11:23:00,"Polar vortex triggers subzero temperatures, 'life-threatening' wind chill",['Alastair Jamieson'],"A polar vortex of brutally cold air sent temperatures plummeting to life-threatening lows across the Midwest and Northeast Saturday, with millions of Americans warned of dangers including frostbite.

The coldest air mass of the winter brought the thermometer down to minus-6 degrees overnight in Minneapolis, while New Yorkers were urged to take extreme precautions against wind chill.

Forecasters warned it would be Tuesday before temperatures return to normal, with Sunday morning likely to be the coldest for many.

The arctic blast is a result of a piece of the polar vortex  the cold air system that sits over the North Pole year-round  coming further south and combining with a cold front.

An eddy of the polar vortex over Quebec, along with a reinforcing cold front, is expected to bring the coldest weather of this winter season from the Great Lakes to New England, the National Weather Service said in an update early Saturday.

Wind chill warnings and lake effect snow warnings are in effect for these areas, with wind chill readings dropping below minus-30 degrees by Saturday night. Actual temperatures will also be frigid with highs in the single digits and teens, and subzero lows across much of upstate New York and New England.

In New York, it was so cold that organizers canceled an Ice Festival scheduled for Saturday in Central Park.

Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to check on vulnerable friends, relatives and neighbors. Extremely cold weather can be life threatening  especially for seniors, infants and people with medical conditions, he said.

And in Washington, D.C., weather was expected to impact Saturdays Cupids Undie Run, a charity race in which participants strip down to their skivvies.

Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, could see record lows over the weekend.

However, apart from lake effect snow over the Great Lakes area, there wont be a repeat of the heavy snow that struck the Northeast earlier this month.

The biggest danger is from frostbite, said John Rowe, lead forecaster at The Weather Channel.

More than 38 million people from the Plains into the Midwest and East Coast were under winter-storm warnings or advisories overnight, according to The Weather Channel.

The coldest air mass of the winter brought the thermometer down to minus 6 degrees overnight in Minneapolis, while New Yorkers were urged to take extreme precautions against wind chill.

These temperatures can be life threatening  especially for seniors, infants and people with medical conditions, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned.

Forecasters warned Sunday morning will likely to be the coldest for many  with New England feeling the deepest chill.

Stay indoors if you can, Weather Channel lead meteorologist Michael Palmer said. With these type of temperatures you can get frostbite within a matter of minutes.

He said parts of New England will see bitterly cold wind-chill factors of 40 below zero, with air-surface temperatures also below zero for much of the Northeast.

New York City could get wind-chill factor of 20 below zero while upstate New York could experience wind chill of 50 below zero, he said.

Several cities had already set record lows as of 4:45 a.m. ET: Boston and Providence both hit minus 9, while Hartford hit minus 10 and Worcester, Massachusetts hit minus 15, according to the National Weather Service.

As of 4:45 AM Records as follows: Boston -9F, Providence -9F, Worcester -15F, Hartford (Bradley) -10F  NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) February 14, 2016

In New York, Central Parks reading of minus one broke a record there, too.

The National Weather Service issued a wind chill warning for the entire state of Connecticut for Saturday night into Sunday morning.

Air temperatures there are expected to tumble into the double-digits below zero in the hills and wind chills are expected to remain near 30 below zero, according to NBC Connecticut.

Police in Hartford canvassed the city overnight to offer shelter to the homeless.

No one should be left out in the cold. These are bitter, nasty conditions, Lt. Gabriel Laureano told NBC Connecticut.

The Philadelphia area also was bracing for record-setting cold, with a low of 2 degrees expected and a wind-chill advisory in effect for the area outside the Poconos. Trentons forecast low of 0 degrees would break a record set in 1916 while the expected minus 12 in the Poconos would break a 1970 record,according to NBC Philadelphia.

Further south, nearly the entire metro-D.C. area was under wind-chill advisories, according to NBC Washington. It reported that winds were expected to drive feels like temperatures to near or below zero.

Temperatures could warm up a bit on Sunday afternoon thanks to a separate storm moving up through the southern part of the U.S., the Weather Channels Palmer said.

That storm system will shove the arctic air out but also bring a band of snowfall up through Washington, New York and Boston later Monday and into Monday night, Palmer added.

msnbc,2016-02-16 15:32:00,Kentucky lawmaker responds to anti-choice law with bill restricting access to Viagra,[],"When her colleagues in the Kentucky legislature decided to pass legislation requiring women to see a doctor 24 hours before having an abortion, Democratic state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian decided to give the bills male supporters a taste of their own medicine. So she introduced a measure she thought equally invasive from their perspective  a bill requiring men to jump through hoops before they can receive drugs for erectile dysfunction.

Introduced last Thursday, House Bill 396 significantly hampers access to erectile dysfunction treatments including Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and Avanafil. If passed, the measure would require every man seeking such drugs to have two doctor visits, provide a signed-and-dated consent letter from his current spouse and make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use the drugs for sex with his current spouse. Only married men would be eligible for erectile dysfunction treatment under the legislation.

Marzian introduced HB 396 one week after Kentuckys Republican Gov. Matt Bevin signed into law a controversial informed consent bill, making the Bluegrass State the 27th in the nation to require that women seeking an abortion undergo counseling and then wait a specified amount of time  most often 24 hours  before they can have the procedure.

I thought, well, if were going to meddle in the private medical decisions between a woman and her health care provider, then we can meddle in mens private health care decisions as well, Marzian told MSNBC in a phone interview Tuesday.

The 61-year-old registered nurse, who has served in the Kentucky House of Representatives since 1994, acknowledged HB 396 stands little chance of passing. Its tongue in cheek, she said.

At the same time, Marzian also believes her proposal addresses a very serious matter  that is, when government ... feels its appropriate to insert themselves into personal, private medical decisions.

The legislature doesnt have a medical degree, said Marzian. Its inappropriate, insulting and demeaning to have this patriarchal view that women cannot talk to their own physicians and figure out what they need to do. All of these anti-choice bills are designed to make it more difficult to obtain safe and legal abortion services.

Its not the the first time a lawmaker has responded to abortion restrictions with an over-the-top proposal targeting men. In 2012, for example, as the Oklahoma Senate considered a personhood bill stipulating that life begins at the moment of conception, former state Sen. Constance Johnson, a Democrat, put forth an amendment that would have outlawed masturbation.

If were talking about protecting life, Johnson reasoned in a satirical segment for The Daily Show, then lets talk about life at its very basic beginning.

Johnsons amendment failed. And in all likelihood, Marzians bill will too. But shes hopeful it wont be the last of its kind.

Already, Marzian said shes preparing an amendment that would apply the same waiting period now required for abortions to gun sales. Under this measure, anyone hoping to buy a firearm would have to wait 24 hours and sit through a counseling session with victims of gun violence, she said.

Marzian is also hoping her approach inspires reproductive rights supporters in other states to fight back against legislation restricting abortion access.

I think it really has awakened the sleeping giant, she said of HB 396. Ive had over 500 emails so far and almost all of them have been supportive and saying they are sick and tired of governments, mostly men, inserting themselves in their doctors office.","['bill', 'lawmaker', 'marzian', 'medical', 'restricting', 'abortion', 'state', 'kentucky', 'access', 'private', 'viagra', 'antichoice', 'responds', 'men', 'measure', 'women', 'law', '396']"

msnbc,2016-02-22 13:02:00,Pound drops as London Mayor Boris Johnson backs 'Brexit' from EU,['Alastair Jamieson'],"LONDON  Britains pound currency plunged in value against the dollar Monday after mop-haired London Mayor Boris Johnson dramatically defected to the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union.

The high-profile announcement dealt a serious blow to Prime Minister David Cameron ahead of the June 23 referendum that could see Britain vote to exit the trading bloc.

It was followed by a string of similar announcements by other senior ministers in Camerons Conservative government, adding to fears that a so-called Brexit is now a real risk.

I think there is genuine worry that Britain might vote to leave and the uncertainty is going to rise into the referendum, Alvin Tan, a strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London, told Reuters.

The pound fell nearly 2 percent at one point to a one-month low of $1.4133, putting it on track for its biggest daily percentage loss since May 2010.

It also fell sharply in early trading against the euro, underscoring jitters about a referendum that polls suggest could be a close-fought battle.

The New York-born mayors endorsement immediately gave the Brexit campaign a huge boost, although he is not the movements official leader or even its most senior backer.

RELATED: The crisis ahead for the EU after Paris

Johnsons buffoonish upper-class persona  he once dangled on a broken zip line waving two British flags  masks a shrewd politician and he is viewed as a possible successor to Cameron. Pursued by a gaggle of reporters as he cycled from his home early Monday, he pledged to promote Britains great future outside the EU as he enjoys his final weeks in office as mayor.

Polls published before Johnsons move suggest the in campaign to keep Britain in the EU has a narrow lead over the out movement, but about one-fifth of voters remain undecided.

The issue has divided not only voters but also political parties: House of Commons lawmakers have been given a free vote to campaign along personal, not party lines.

A Brexit would strip the EU of its second-largest economy and a major military power, adding to its woes amid Europes migration crisis and the collapse of the Greek economy.

The EU can do things that NATO cannot, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said Monday, arguing that Britain could not survive alone. At the moment our defense and security rests on NATO, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security.

Other pro-Europeans, including former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have warned that an exit could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another independence vote in less-skeptical Scotland.

In a 2,000-word article explaining his decision, Johnson said his beef was not with Europe but with the EU itself, which he said was a political project that was increasingly undemocratic.

Britain needs to be supportive of its friends and allies  but on the lines originally proposed by Winston Churchill: interested, associated, but not absorbed; with Europe  but not comprised, he wrote.

Cameron, who last week negotiated new terms for Britains membership of the EU, is tasked with persuading voters that the U.K. would suffer financially if it quit.

He has received the backing of business leaders, according to the Financial Times which reported Monday that 100 CEOs were ready to publicly endorse the in campaign.

But 45-year-old Jason Brian Dalton will face justice from a jail cell when he is arraigned on the charges, which also include two counts of attempted murder and eight felony firearms charges.

The suspect will be appearing by video feed from the Kalamazoo County Jail, the Kalamazoo County Prosecutors Office said in a statement.

Dalton, an insurance adjuster who was moonlighting as an Uber driver, cruised around the city Saturday night picking his targets seemingly at random before he was finally captured, police said.

But investigators still havent divulge a motive for the horrific spree, which left six dead and two more wounded, including a 14-year-old girl who remains in critical condition.

A married father of two, Dalton had no police record or anything in his background that would lead us to believe he was capable of this type of behavior, Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley said on Sunday.

RELATED: Kalamazoo rampage victims were attacked doing ordinary weekend activities

Meanwhile, heartbroken Kalamazoo residents gathered Monday at St. Augustine Cathedral for a Mass in memory of the victims: Richard Smith, 53, his 17-year-old son, Tyler, both of Kalamazoo; 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye of Battle Creek; her 62-year-old sister-in-law Mary Lou Nye of Baroda; 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne and 74-year-old Dorothy Brown, both of Battle Creek.

Earlier, President Obama said he he called the mayor, the sheriff, and the police chief there and told them that they would have whatever federal support they needed in their investigation.

The attack in San Bernardino killed 14 of our fellow Americans, Obama said in remarks to the National Governors Association. And heres a hard truth: We probably lost even more Americans than that to guns this weekend alone. On Saturday, another one of our communities was terrorized by gun violence.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder ordered flags across the state lowered to half-staff for six days starting Monday  one day for each of the victims.

I met with two (victim) families in Kalamazoo yesterday, Snyder said during a press conference. What a tough situation.

msnbc,2016-02-18 19:19:00,Mysteries of the Zika virus stump even the experts,['Maggie Fox'],"Zika virus shows up in urine, saliva and semen. And it seems to go right to the brain in fetuses, but nowhere else in their bodies.

So its no wonder this once-obscure virus is mystifying even the experts.

Zika is spreading explosively across Latin America and the Caribbean. The islands of Bonaire and Aruba are the latest to report local spread, according to Marcos Espinal of the Pan American Health Organization.

Such rapid movement is not unexpected when a new virus  in this case, spread by an extremely efficient mosquito  shows up in a population with almost no immunity.

But almost everything else about Zika is surprising  especially the seemingly new links with birth defects and a rare condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome.

I am trying to understand why what we are seeing in Brazil we havent seen in 30 years of circulation in Southeast Asia (and elsewhere), said Dr. Stephen Thomas, an Army colonel and virus expert at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research.

Doctors largely ignored Zika because it usually caused such mild symptoms, if it even caused any symptoms at all.

One study suggests 80 percent of people infected never even noticed, while the other 20 percent mostly suffered rash and a mild fever.

But in Brazil, its not only making people noticeably sick, its suspected of causing a giant increase in serious birth defects and perhaps Guillain-Barre syndrome.

One thing thats holding up research is the lack of a quick and easy test for Zika. Quick tests get Zika mixed up with related viruses that are also common and spreading in the region, including dengue virus and chikungunya.

To try to figure out if anyone else had noticed this, Thomas took the tried-and-true tack of checking the literature  searching through the few scientific papers that have been written about Zika since its discovery in Uganda in 1947.

RELATED: Is Pope Francis contraception allowance during Zika threat a major shift for church?

He found a lot of virus experts have also been baffled by Zikas weird qualities.

For instance, Didier Musso of the Louis Malarde Institute in Tahiti and his colleagues found that Zika was easier to detect in saliva than in blood during an outbreak there in 2013 and 2014. They found Zika in the blood of 28 percent of patients with symptoms, but they could get genetic material from the virus out of 57 percent of saliva samples.

It makes me question whether blood is the proper fluid to be sampling if (you) want to capture Zika, Thomas told a packed seminar on Zika at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health this week.

Brazilian researchers have also reported finding evidence of Zika virus in the urine of patients.

Ann-Claire Gourinat of the Institut Pasteur in Noumea, New Caledonia, reported this last year, as well, after studying the Tahiti outbreak.

Urine samples were positive for Zika virus more than 10 days after onset of disease, which was a notably longer period than for serum samples. This finding supports the conclusion that urine samples are useful for diagnosis of Zika virus infections, they wrote in a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Zika has also been found in amniotic fluid, which mostly is made from the urine produced by the fetus, said Dr. Jeanne Sheffield, director of maternal-fetal medicine at Johns Hopkins.

Theres no evidence that the genetic material from Zika that can be found in saliva and urine can infect people. But a handful of reports suggest the mosquito-borne virus can also be found in and transmitted by semen.

But the findings suggest that testing blood for Zika might not help doctors get on top of the epidemic, Thomas said.

Between the saliva and the semen and the urine, Im not sure what the best samples might be, he said, adding, It also makes me question whether this (is) just a mosquito-to-human transmission.

RELATED: US athletes should consider not attending Olympics if they fear Zika: Officials

Experts took up the issue at a workshop sponsored by the National Academy of Medicine this week.

Theres an urgent need to understand the other modes of transmission and to communicate effectively about them, Dr. Andrew Pavia, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of Utah, said at that meeting.

Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not directly answered questions about the case of a person in Dallas who caught Zika from a sexual partner whod traveled to Venezuela.

They said they presume it was sexually transmitted but reiterated they were investigating further.

One comforting finding is the lack of evidence that mothers can infect their babies through breast milk  although genetic material from Zika can be found in the liquid. The human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS can and does infect babies through breast milk and its very commonly transmitted in semen, but not via saliva or urine.

Another odd effect of Zika  or suspected effect  is what it does to adeveloping fetuss brain.

Its the No. 1 suspect behind a rise in cases of microcephaly, an often devastating birth defect marked by an underdeveloped brain and smaller-than-normal head.

Doctors who have been able to autopsy miscarriages, abortions or babies who died soon after birth are finding unusual and troubling brain damage not usually associated with microcephaly.

Its not just a small head. There are a lot of abnormalities in the brain, Sheffield told the seminar.

These include a smoother-than-normal brain surface  a healthy human brain is very wrinkled  and shrunken brain stems. Theres evidence of damaged eyes, too.

Other viruses are known to damage the brains of developing infants. A herpes virus called cytomegalovirus and rubella, or German measles, are the most notorious.

But Dr. Albert Ko of Yale University, whos been working in Brazil for decades, says the recent microcephaly cases look different.

These are severe presentations, Ko told the seminar. Brain scans show calcifications  hardened tissue that has been damaged and died. There are entire missing areas, sometimes replaced by fluid.

And the other viruses usually affect other areas of the babys body. The Zika-linked damage, however, is confined entirely to the brain.

Thomas says this fits in with decades-old research on animals that suggests Zika prefers to infect nerve tissue.

And that fits in with the final baffling effect of Zika. Is it causing Guillain-Barre syndrome, an inflammation of the nerves that can cause sometime-serious paralysis after any number of infections?

It could be the virus has changed in some way. It could be cross-reacting with its relative, dengue, in people who have been infected with both. Or it could be something else.

msnbc,2016-02-22 08:12:00,Democratic primary finds black feminists conflicted,[],"Ask a black feminist whether she prefers Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, and you very well might hear Neither.

I long for Shirley Chisholm to be running, to be really honest, said Renee Bracey Sherman, a reproductive justice activist in Washington, D.C.

Alas for Bracey Sherman, the congresswoman who in 1972 was the first major-party black candidate to run for president, and who promised a bloodless revolution, isnt running. (Chisholm died over a decade ago.) But two candidates who vow to make history in their own ways are, and Bracey Sherman, like many black feminists MSNBC interviewed, is ambivalent.

Im definitely weighing my options, she said. A lot of my beliefs on economic policies fall in line with Bernie Sanders. However, he is not able to connect the way that gender and race intersect with economic inequality the way Hillary does.

For weeks, Sanders and Clinton and their allies have tussled over who is the genuine progressive, whose policies are more feminist and who can make the most meaningful difference in black Americans lives. So far, as the primary has shifted from majority white states to more diverse ones, the feminist mantle and the black vote have been talked about as if they are separate silos.

An emphasis on not only black women, but black feminists, is long overdue, said Lori Adelman, co-executive director of Feministing. So often, black womens support is taken for granted.

The candidates are both concertedly seeking the votes of black women, long a crucial base of the Democratic Party. Both have hired prominent black women, including feminist activists, to represent their campaigns, though Clintons inner circle has long been more diverse. Over the weekend, entrance polls showed Clinton winning black voters in Nevada, and polls of South Carolina, which votes Saturday, show Clinton enjoys a broad advantage among African-American voters there too. But in interviews, black feminists with influential perches in activism, journalism and academia critiqued both Democrats.

Im glad for any feminist who feels confident that their needs will be met by Hillary or Bernies presidency, Shanelle Matthews, lead communications strategist for Black Lives Matter, wrote in an email. As a black feminist, Im not there yet. And frankly, Id like to stop being lectured by white feminists who would boorishly call themselves my ally while also paternalistically scolding me for not bending toward their political ideologies.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Hillary Clinton Clinton arguably boasts experience in government unparalleled by anyone in the presidential field  but that has also made her a high-profile target for attack.



If Hillary wants to court black women, she should start by apologizing for all the ways she has hurt our families and us, said Matthews.

Black feminist critics of Clinton cite in particular past support of her husbands policies on criminal justice and welfare reform, which exacted a disproportionate toll on African-Americans. They recoil at how in 1996, Clinton referred to super predators who needed to be brought to heel, which many saw as dehumanizing language that targeted black children in particular.

University of Pennsylvania professor Salamishah Tillet, who described herself as undecided but leaning Sanders, said, Its hard for me to champion a Clinton prosperity narrative as proof of electability of another candidate when I feel like it decimated the black community and criminalized black men.

Still, Tillet said, she thinks Clinton has been far more adept than Sanders in using an approach pioneered by black feminists. Im increasingly becoming impressed with how Clinton is invoking an intersectional framework, she said, referring to the term coined by law professor Kimberle Crenshaw to invoke how overlapping identities shape marginalization.

Clinton even came out and used the word in her speech in Harlem last week, quite possibly a first. We face a complex set of economic, social and political challenges, Clinton said. They are intersectional, they are reinforcing and weve got to take them all on.

And the candidates recent refrain that she is not a single-issue candidate, implicitly an attack on Sanders relentless focus on economics, seems to evoke a much quoted line from the black lesbian poet Audre Lorde: There is no thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.

That resonated with Jamia Wilson, a feminist writer and activist who is supporting Clinton. Those of us who are asked to wait our turn rarely get our turn when other things are prioritized, she said.

Sanders, who won women voters in majority-white New Hampshire, has sometimes been clumsier in deploying feminist arguments. Asked at MSNBCs Nevada town hall Thursday about whether he, as a white man, understood the intersectional identities that people of color face, especially when entering high positions of power within business or government, Sanders said he was a strong feminist and spoke about the broader pay gap for women of color but never really engaged the question. (He also joked that Gloria Steinem, a Clinton supporter, had once called him an honorary woman.)

And earlier that day, Sanders had said of Clintons appeals to shattering the glass ceiling, I dont go around, no one has ever heard me say, Hey, guys, lets stand together, vote for a man. I would never do that, never have.

His words irked many feminists, including Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst at RH Reality Check and co-host of the podcast TWIB Prime. After all, no one has ever had to rally men to vote for men  its simply the norm.

Gandy was a fervent Barack Obama supporter in 2008 who now thinks she will sit the primary out. Im fed up with the Sanders campaign, frankly, she said. She cited Sanders contention in the same interview that Clinton is pandering to the black vote. While I still have questions about Clintons credibility, she said, I do appreciate that she is at least trying to connect to black voters.

That Clinton would be the first female president was rarely mentioned in interviews. Tillet wonders if the experience of the Obama presidency has complicated Clintons bid for history-making as the first female president. There has been a contradiction with the idea that weve had this African-American president, but theres still been a deep resentment towards African-Americans in so many spheres of public life, she said. Being the first doesnt always mean that the material conditions for that group will change, though I think there is a long-term change we will never be able to measure.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Bernie Sanders The self-described democratic socialist is known for pushing change on income inequality, college affordability and criminal justice reform. said that electing somebody with my views  a socialist  would be of some historical accomplishment.

The irony that the most revolutionary candidate is a white man isnt lost on black feminists. Brittney Cooper, a professor at Rutgers University, observed on Facebook, Its just interesting to me that progress in the last election was being able to have a black male (centrist) president and vote for him, especially if you were black. Now progress in this election seems to be feeling the freedom not to vote for a (centrist) woman if youre a woman. Its all very odd.

RELATED: African-American group based in Nevadas largest county backs Bernie Sanders

Jamilah Lemieux, a senior editor at Ebony who interviewed Sanders while wearing a Chisholm sweatshirt, wondered, Will it take having an older white guy to have a revolutionary president? Just imagine if Barack or Hillary, but particularly Barack, said the things Sanders said about overthrowing things. She added that when it came to Clinton, Its hard to see the sexism against her. It does make me protective of her in ways Im not used to being. (Lemieux declined to say which candidate she will support.)

After a bruising period during which two highly visible black intellectuals, Michelle Alexander and Ta-Nehisi Coates, came out with a blistering critique and an intention to vote for Sanders, respectively, Clintons recent focus on intersectionality may be reaching its desired audience.

Bracey Sherman, for one, heard a lot of what she has been waiting for in Clintons Harlem speech. I believe Im seeing the shifts in her campaign that I have wanted to see, where shes speaking clearly about the systemic racism and disinvestment in black communities, said Bracey Sherman, including disproportionately high infant mortality rates and the crisis in Flint, Michigan. She touched on black womens entrepreneurship and the re-segregation, and disinvestment, of schools, which are complex issues that I havent heard candidates speak openly about, and thats a huge shift.

Still, fatigue was the overwhelming sentiment expressed in interviews. Obama is a hard act to follow. Compared to the last [presidential] election, its hard to summon that kind of excitement, said Lemieux.

At the end of the day, I think both of them have problems, said Gandy. But one candidate is being sold to me as a savior and the other one is being sold to me as business as usual. She added, I just dont really have a dog in this fight, I just want it to be over. And I dont want Republicans to win.","['sanders', 'conflicted', 'clinton', 'feminist', 'primary', 'hillary', 'black', 'women', 'feminists', 'vote', 'president', 'democratic', 'finds', 'clintons']"
msnbc,2016-02-22 10:10:00,"Study: Film industry still 'a straight, white, boy's club'",[],"As Hollywood gears up for the Academy Awards on Sunday, the University of Southern Californias Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has released a bombshell study about the lack of diversity in the business, concluding the film industry still functions as a straight, white, boys club.

The report, which serves as indictment of studio efforts not just in front of the camera but behind it as well, will likely only add fuel to a raging debate about inclusion in the world of film and television, which was reignited in earnest after the Oscars failed to nominate a single actor of color for the second year in a row.

USC, whose film school has produced cinematic legends like Ron Howard and George Lucas, has previously looked at inequality in 700 films released between 2007 to 2014, have now narrowed their focus to one year (2014) and included a look at the corporate side of studios, as well as television and digital content. The results, which are based on 109 major motion pictures and 305 scripted TV or digital series, should serve as yet another wake-up call for an industry that has historically prided itself in its progressive values, but has far too often not reflected their politics in their hiring choices.

RELATED: Producer: Black-run Hollywood studio would solve #OscarsSoWhite

According to the new study, women are wildly underrepresented across all platforms. Female characters possess only 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film, and they get just 25.7 percent of the parts for actors age 40 or older, while men get the remaining 74.3 percent. The study also found that women are also more likely to be portrayed in sexualized circumstances in scantily clad clothing. Meanwhile, very few female directors are calling the shots behind the scenes. While evaluating hundreds of films and shows, the USC study found that men comprise 84.8 percent of directors, 71.1 percent of writers and 77.4 percent of show creators. And in perhaps the most telling metric, women hold an average of 39.1 percent of all the executive positions in the industry.

When it comes to diversity, the lack of representation of black performers and artists has been oft-discussed, but this study points out at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories fail to portray one speaking or named Asian or Asian American on screen. And when people of color are portrayed, they are more often than not males (62.3 percent to 37.7 percent). Meanwhile, only 13 percent of the 407 directors evaluated were from an underrepresented minority group, and only two of those filmmakers were women  Ava DuVernay (Selma) and Amma Asante (Belle).

Arguably faring worst of all is the LGBT community, which is virtually non existent compared to other groups on screen. According to the USC study, only 2 percent of all speaking characters across the 414 movies, television shows, and digital series evaluated were coded LGB. And less that 1 percent of the characters in the films evaluated are identified as transgender, and four of the seven trans characters appeared in a single digital show. And when gay characters are included in Hollywood productions, they are disproportionately white and male and rarely are they seen in parental relationships.

While the Academy Awards have instituted new reforms to try to evolve their notoriously white, male and elderly voting population, the USC study has its own solutions in mind for what could be described as a #HollywoodSoWhite crisis. The authors encourage the industry to police itself by setting inclusion standards (not unlike what the NFL does with its Rooney Rule, which aims to diversify head coaching positions), and to work harder to disabuse themselves of preconceived notions about how films with a minority or female lead will perform and stereotypical concepts of the kinds of roles they should play.

Case in point, last years highest grossing film  the biggest domestic success in U.S. history (without adjusting for inflation)  Star Wars: The Force Awakens, starred a woman and a black man. People are still erased. Its 2016 and its time for a change, Stacy L. Smith, a USC professor and one of the studys authors, told The Hollywood Reporter. Weve laid out concrete actionable steps because we dont want to do this again in 10 years.","['television', 'usc', 'club', 'study', 'digital', 'boys', 'characters', 'straight', 'films', 'white', 'women', 'industry', 'film', 'hollywood']"

msnbc,2016-02-21 16:10:00,Governor John Kasich signs Ohio bill to cut Planned Parenthood funding,[],"Republican presidential hopeful and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday signed a bill that aims to strip funding from Planned Parenthood in the state.

Its a long-expected but controversial move that ignites a debate that seeped into his presidential campaign. Kasich faced a number of protesters this week while campaigning in South Carolina who challenged him on the issue during his events.

After Kasich came in a strong second place in the New Hampshire primary, the Republican assembly in Ohio passed legislation that targets about $1.3 million in funding for Planned Parenthood in the state.

That money helps support screenings for breast cancer, STD testing, programs working to prevent violence against women, and more. State and federal laws already prohibit taxpayer dollars from going to fund abortions, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

RELATED: Planned Parenthood: Kasich is terrible for womens health

Although the legislation does not specifically name the organization  it cites any entity that performs or promotes nontherapeutic abortions  and its believed that Planned Parenthood will be most affected.

Planned Parenthood immediately fired back to the news, as the organizations president Cecile Richards claimed the bill will have devastating consequences for women across Ohio.

Its clear Kasich has no regard for womens health or lives, and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood, she said in a statement.

Kasich was repeatedly asked about the issue of Planned Parenthood at his town halls across New Hampshire throughout the summer, fall and winter, and consistently told audiences that he doesnt believe government funding should go to the organization because he says they discredited themselves, and adds that he favors funding for womens health through other means.

The fact is that Governor Kasich has been a strong advocate for womens health issues by helping 260,000 women gain access to health care coverage, pledging a 3-1 state match for a fund for breast and cervical cancer screenings, strengthening programs for sexual assault prevention, funding rape crisis centers for the first time in Ohios history, helping more women get access to childcare and protecting women from human trafficking, his spokesman Joe Andrews said in a statement.

RELATED: Anti-Planned Parenthood activists reversal of fortune

The state, through the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) has at least 150 other sub-grantees and contractors for the affected grants and projects addressing such issues as infant mortality, violence against women, and minority HIV/AIDS. ODH will reallocate funding from ineligible providers under the new law to other currently eligible providers, ranging from local health departments and community organizations to hospitals and universities.

It was suspected that Kasich might sign the bill before the South Carolina primary, in the hopes that the move would help him there, but instead he signed it one day after finishing with about 8 percent, near the bottom of the pack in the state.

As the bill moved to Kasichs office while he campaigned across South Carolina, the governors events were interrupted by protesters in Bluffton, Fort Mill, and Mt. Pleasant, who each shouted, Governor Kasich, why do you hate womens health?

Kasich responded to each interruption the same way, remarking as a kid who went to college in 70s, if I dont see a good protest, I aint living.

Give em a round of applause, they are allowed to come in and scream, he added when he was interrupted at his election eve rally aboard the USS Yorktown off Mt. Pleasant.

The women who interrupted him in Bluffton on Wednesday work for Planned Parenthood, and one of them was from Kasichs home state.

Im from the state of Ohio and Im a little disappointed that Governor Kasich is cutting off preventative health care services from tens of thousands of women in the state of Ohio, said Emma Akpan, a Planned Parenthood field organizer, who was one of three protesters at the event who held signs saying Who pays for cancer treatment? Can I get birth control at the dentist? and Why do you hate womens health??

The fact that Governor Kasich is cutting off this funding  he is hurting women in Ohio, she added.

Responding to the protesters in Bluffton, Kasich told his crowd, We are not cutting off womens health and were not going to fund Planned Parenthood cause they put themselves in this pickle.

What were gonna do is make sure that womens health will get funding, he said. I do not mind when young people feel passionately about something. Its a lot better than seeing them on these electronic devices and all that kind of stuff.

Hip-hop legend and Wu-Tang clan member, Method Man made headlines when he spoke out during the aftermath of Eric Garners death in his hometown of Staten Island, New York. Now, hes speaking out about the ongoing unrest and police tensions in Ferguson, Missouri following the resignation of Police Chief Thomas Jackson and the shooting of two police officers during a rally early Thursday morning.

During his conversation with Tamron Hall, Method Man talks about the officer involved death of his friend Ernest Sayon and recalls his own encounters with police growing up saying, being a youth in the hood, I would be harassed. Illegal searches - the works. But he also acknowledges that there are great cops out there that go above and beyond the call of duty.

Although relations between communities and those in authority have improved throughout the years, there is still an adversarial relationship between some police officers and some in minority communities - black and brown specifically. Method Man says a lot of that has to do with the communication barriers, and suggests that there should be some type of forum for both sides to speak to each other, so there can be some type of understanding.

Its all about fear... An [officer] is still a human being and when that fear kicks in, you never know what can happen.  Method Man

At the end of the day, why are relationships with the police so strained and why are tensions so high? Method Man suggests that its all about fear on both sides. The community he said are afraid of the police, what they can do and the power that theyve willed. On the other hand, police officers are just as frightened as [we are], but [have] guns. He points out however, that when it comes down to human nature, we must keep in mind an officer is still a human being and when that fear kicks in, you never know what can happen.

The recent events in Ferguson compelled Method Man to share his thoughts on police tensions, but he was originally scheduled to talk with Tamron Hall about his new movie, The Cobbler with Adam Sandler. The comedy follows the life of a New York shoe repair man who stumbles upon a magical heirloom that allows him to step into the lives of his customers and see the world in a new way.

msnbc,2016-02-22 13:42:00,"Rubio knocks Cruz for 'dishonest' tactics, but avoids Trump",['Alexandra Jaffe'],"LAS VEGAS  Marco Rubio is keeping up the heat on Ted Cruz, suggesting he should fire someone for what he called a pattern of deceptive and untrue tactics and comments coming from Cruzs campaign.

But at the same time, hes continuing to avoid attacking the GOP front-runner, Donald Trump, even as he claims the fight for the nomination has narrowed to a three-man race.

Speaking to reporters before departing on his charter for a three-stop tour of Nevada on Monday, Rubio said with Cruzs campaign, were now at a point where we start asking about accountability. You talk about the VA, where people who arent doing their job need to be fired well, whos going to be fired when Ted Cruz is president? Because this campaign now has repeatedly done things that they have to apologize for and no ones ever held accountable.

His comments came in response to a video circulated by Cruz backers over the weekend that claimed  erroneously  to show Rubio telling Cruzs father, Rafael, and one of his staffers that there arent many answers in the Bible. The chance encounter between Rubio and the Cruz contingency was caught on-film and someone incorrectly transcribed the interaction in on-screen text, and Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler posted it on his Facebook page.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubio told reporters that he had actually told the Cruz staffer that the answer to every question youll ever have is in that book - and then I pointed to the Book of Proverbs, which he was reading, I said, particularly that one, which is the book of wisdom.

And then for them to take a video and to transcribe words on it that are the complete opposite of what I said  its incredibly disturbing, he said.

The Cruz campaign ultimately chalked the video up to a misunderstanding, and Tyler apologized for it. Rubio said he accepted the apology but ticked off the recent controversies dogging Cruz over his campaign tactics  his staffers telling Iowa voters Ben Carson had dropped out; controversial robocalls allegedly coming from the senators campaign in South Carolina and an ad attacking Rubio on cap and trade that South Carolina networks eventually took off-air because it misstated the facts  and said the latest video was part of a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns or flat-out just lying.

Its a continuation of an attack Rubio first launched in Iowa, where he accused Cruz of saying or doing anything to get elected, and ramped up in South Carolina after Cruz and Rubio each exchanged charges the other was lying at the last GOP debate.

Rubios campaign kept up the scrutiny on Cruz through the weekend, issuing a call last Friday for their supporters to keep an eye out for dirty tricks from the Cruz campaign. And it wasnt just Rubio accusing Cruz of dishonesty  Donald Trump took up the charge as well, amplifying the message and contributing to a drop in Cruzs popularity over the past week that ultimately helped Rubio gain a slight edge over him in the South Carolina primary.

Rubios second-place finish spurred Jeb Bush to drop out of the race, helping to consolidate the GOP primary into a largely three-man battle between Rubio, Cruz and Trump. But where Rubio hasnt shied away from attacking Cruz, hes been reluctant to take aim at Trump, avoiding every opportunity to criticize the front-runner  to the chagrin of some in the GOP.

On Monday, he again toed that cautious line. Asked if he agreed with a new ad from a super PAC supporting his bid that called Trump erratic, unreliable, Rubio said he hadnt seen the ad and declined to comment on its substance. And while he raised doubts about his foreign policy understanding, Rubio still gave Trump the benefit of the doubt on that issue.

I have said that when it comes to issues of national security, Donald has yet to prove that he has an in-depth understanding or the judgment to make good decisions about that  that could change, he said.
